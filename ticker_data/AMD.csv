2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2016,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”IntroductionWe are a global semiconductor company primarily offering:(i)x86 microprocessors, as a standalone central processing unit (CPU) or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, and discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) for the consumer, commercial and professional graphics markets; and (ii)server and embedded CPUs, GPUs and APUs, and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles. In this MD&A, we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. Overview We faced a challenging business environment in 2015. The impact of global macro-economic conditions, especially the volatility in the Greater China region contributed to a decrease in demand for our products. Additionally, competitive pressures contributed to an overall challenging year. We also experienced reduced demand from our Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) customers in advance of the launch of Microsoft Windows® 10. Net revenue for 2015 was approximately $4.0 billion, a decrease of 28% compared to 2014 net revenue of $5.5 billion. The decrease in net revenue from 2014 was due to a 42% decrease in Computing and Graphics segment revenue and an 8% decrease in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue. Computing and Graphics segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower client processor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower server and embedded revenue and lower game console royalties, partially offset by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2015, was 27% compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and due to lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Operating loss for 2015 was $481 million compared to an operating loss of $155 million in 2014. The decline in operating performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and in gross margin as described above. Despite the challenging business environment, we made important changes to our business. During 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio. As part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products, we introduced a number of new products in 2015 including, our 6th Generation AMD A-Series mobile processors (formerly codenamed “Carrizo”) in a SoC design and introduced a desktop A-series processor, the AMD A10-7870K APU. We also introduced the A8-7670K APU designed to support Windows® 10, mainstream workloads and online gaming. With respect to our graphics products, we introduced the new AMD Radeon™ R9 Fury X and R9 Fury graphics, the AMD Radeon R7 300 and R9 300 series graphics as well as the AMD Radeon M300 series graphics to reinforce our graphics leadership in both power efficiency for notebooks and best-in class performance for desktops. We also expanded our AMD FirePro™ server GPU family by introducing the AMD FirePro S9170, designed for high performance compute (HPC) environments. The AMD FirePro S9170 is based on second-generation AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN) GPU architecture and a unified scalable GPU optimized for graphics and compute. We announced the AMD FirePro W4300 graphics card designed for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for both small and full-size workstations. We also launched the AMD Radeon R9 Nano, a small-form-factor mini-ITX enthusiast graphics card designed to deliver energy efficiency and performance for ultra-high resolutions, improved virtual reality experiences and smoother gameplay. With respect 34to our embedded products, we introduced the AMD Embedded R-Series SOC processor designed for digital signage, retail signage, medical imaging, electronic gaming, media storage and communications and networking.During 2015, we continued to focus on reducing our expenses. Our operating expenses in 2015 decreased to $1.56 billion, from $1.99 billion in 2014. Our operating expenses in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million. We also took steps to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. In the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan). The 2015 Restructuring Plan provides for a workforce reduction of approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. The 2015 Restructuring Plan also anticipates a charge for the consolidation of certain real estate facilities. We realized operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $8 million in 2015. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan to result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $48 million in 2016. On October 15, 2015, we entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement) with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a Chinese joint stock company (JV Party), under which we will sell to JV Party a majority of the equity interests in AMD Technologies (China) Co. Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise incorporated as a limited liability company (the Chinese Target Company), and Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian limited liability company (the Malaysian Target Company and, together with the Chinese Target Company, the Target Companies), thereby forming two joint ventures (collectively, the JVs) with JV Party in a transaction valued at approximately $436 million (the Transaction). The JV Party will acquire 85% of the equity interests in each JV for approximately $371 million and we estimate we will receive approximately $320 million cash, net of taxes and other customary expenses. After closing, JV Party’s affiliates will own 85% of the equity interests in each JV while certain of our subsidiaries will own the remaining 15%. The Transaction will result in the JVs providing assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services (ATMP) to us. We plan to account for our investment in the JVs under the equity method of accounting. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 26, 2015 were $785 million compared to $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014. Total debt as of December 26, 2015 was $2.26 billion, compared to $2.2 billion as of December 27, 2014.GLOBALFOUNDRIESFormation and Accounting On March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (currently known as Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech) and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), pursuant to which we formed GF. In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD, Mubadala Tech and GF entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement) and a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement) on March 2, 2009.At GF’s formation on March 2, 2009 and through December 26, 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and we were deemed to be GF’s primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidated GF under applicable accounting rules. As a result of certain GF governance changes, we deconsolidated GF and accounted for our GF ownership under the equity method of accounting as of December 27, 2009. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party. In the first quarter of 2011, as a result of a contribution to GF by an affiliate of Mubadala Tech and certain GF governance changes noted above, our ownership in GF was diluted, and we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, we changed our accounting for our investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we identified indicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. We performed a valuation analysis and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million. The carrying value of our remaining investment in GF after the impairment charge was $278 million as of December 31, 2011. On March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, we transferred to GF all of the remaining capital stock of GF that we owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and we were no longer party to the Shareholders’ Agreement. As a result of these transactions, we no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012. GF continues to be a related party of us because Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, our largest stockholder. WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala.35Wafer Supply Agreement The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures microprocessor and APU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and APU products to GF.The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply.Third Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On December 6, 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us from the fourth quarter of 2012 through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded a lower of cost or market charge of $273 million for the write-down of inventory to its market value in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee was paid over several quarters, with $80 million paid on December 28, 2012, $40 million paid on April 1, 2013 and $200 million paid on December 31, 2013.Fourth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On March 30, 2014, we entered into a fourth amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the fourth amendment was to establish volume purchase commitments and fixed pricing for the 2014 calendar year as well as to modify certain other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for some of our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom game console products to be delivered by GF to us during the 2014 calendar year.Fifth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On April 16, 2015, we entered into a fifth amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the fifth amendment was to establish volume purchase commitments and fixed pricing for the 2015 calendar year as well as to modify certain other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for some of our microprocessor unit, graphics processor unit and semi-custom products to be delivered by GF to us during the 2015 calendar year.As of December 26, 2015, certain wafer deliveries under the fifth amendment to the WSA have been delayed until fiscal 2016. As of December 26, 2015, purchase obligations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $248 million, of which approximately $185 million, consisting of wafers and research and development activities, were received by December 31, 2015. We generally negotiate our purchase commitments with GF on an annual basis and as such we cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF. We are currently in the process of negotiating a sixth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.Our total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities were approximately $0.9 billion for 2015 and approximately $1 billion for each 2014 and 2013, respectively. Equity Interest Purchase AgreementOn October 15, 2015, we entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement) with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a Chinese joint stock company (JV Party), under which we will sell to JV Party a majority of the equity interests in AMD Technologies (China) Co. Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise incorporated as a limited liability company (the Chinese Target Company), and Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian limited liability company (the Malaysian Target Company and, together with the Chinese Target Company, the Target Companies), thereby forming two joint ventures (collectively, the JVs) with JV Party in a transaction valued at approximately $436 million (the Transaction). The JV Party will acquire 85% of the equity interests in each JV for approximately $371 million and we estimate we will receive approximately $320 million cash, net of taxes and other customary expenses. After closing, JV Party’s affiliates will own 85% of the equity interests in each JV while certain of our subsidiaries will own the remaining 15%. The Transaction will result in the JVs providing assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services (ATMP) to us. We plan to account for our investment in the JVs under the equity method of accounting. The Equity Interest Purchase Agreement also has related agreements including: (i) with respect to the Malaysian Target Company, a Shareholders’ Agreement, and with respect to the Chinese Target Company, a Joint Venture Contract governing the joint venture relationships from and after the Closing, (ii) an IP License Agreement, (iii) a Manufacturing Services Agreement, (iv) a Transition Services Agreement, and (v) a Trademark License Agreement.36 The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, pending all regulatory and other approvals.As a result of the decision to form the above JVs, the balance sheet as of December 26, 2015, reflects held-for-sale accounting of the ATMP assets and liabilities which requires reclassification of such financial amounts to current assets and current liabilities. We reclassified $183 million to other current assets and $79 million to other current liabilities. Asset balances reclassified into other current assets primarily consist of property, plant, and equipment of $110 million, goodwill of $42 million and inventory of $15 million. Liability balances reclassified into other current liabilities primarily consist of accounts payable of $70 million. The balances included in the final gain/(loss) calculation, at closing, are likely to be different due to normal operational activities occurring through the closing date.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market condition. The key assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13% to 35% from 2013 to 2015. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the 37uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any.Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly-traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2015, each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value, ranging from approximately 17% to approximately 196%. The Computing and Graphics reporting unit had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at 17%, however there is no goodwill within this reporting unit. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 27, 2015, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit. Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014, we determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of $233 million was recorded, which represented the entire goodwill balance within this reporting unit. The remaining two reporting units’ estimated fair values exceeded their carrying value, ranging from approximately 156% to approximately 209%. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 28, 2014, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2013, each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment. Estimates of fair value for all or our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. Potential events or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment.Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.Results of OperationsManagement, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. In connection with our continued strategic transformation, effective July 1, 2014, we realigned our organizational structure. As a result of this organizational change, we have the following two reportable segments:•the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics; and•the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties.In addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does 38not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. Also included in this category are amortization of acquired intangible assets, employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other special charges, net, technology node transition charge, workforce rebalancing severance charges, goodwill impairment charge, significant or unusual lower of cost or market inventory adjustments and a net gain from licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters. We also reported the results of former businesses in the All Other category because the operating results were not material. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.We use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 each included 52 weeks. References in this report to 2015, 2014 and 2013 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise.The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) before income taxes for 2015, 2014 and 2013. The results prior to July 1, 2014 have been recast to reflect our new reportable segments. 2015 2014 2013 (In millions)Net revenue: Computing and Graphics$1,805 $3,132 $3,720Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom2,186 2,374 1,577All Other— — 2Total net revenue$3,991 $5,506 $5,299Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics$(502) $(76) $(101)Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom215 399 295All Other(194) (478) (91)Total operating income (loss)$(481) $(155) $103Interest expense(160) (177) (177)Other income expense, net(5) (66) —Loss before income taxes$(646) $(398) $(74)Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics net revenue of $1.8 billion in 2015 decreased by 42% compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 as a result of a 44% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by a 3% increase in average selling price. Unit shipments of all our Computing and Graphics products decreased. The decrease in unit shipments of all categories of products was due to lower demand caused by challenging global macro economic conditions, especially in the Greater China region, in addition to increased competitive pressures and reduced demand from our OEM customers in advance of the Microsoft Windows® 10 operating system. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our notebook GPU products and AIB products due to a favorable shift in our product mix, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of our notebook microprocessor products and chipset products.Computing and Graphics net revenue of $3.1 billion in 2014 decreased by 16% compared to $3.7 billion in 2013 as a result of a 27% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by a 15% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was primarily attributable to lower unit shipments of our microprocessor products for desktop and notebook PCs and chipsets due to challenging consumer PC market conditions and our chipsets being integrated into our APU products. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our microprocessor products due to improved product mix of our microprocessor products for desktop and notebook PCs.Computing and Graphics operating loss was $502 million in 2015 compared to $76 million in 2014. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $696 million decrease in cost of sales, a $120 million decrease in research and development expenses and an $84 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by an inventory write-down of $52 million as a result of lower anticipated demand for primarily older-generation APU products. 39Operating loss in 2014 included a $19 million benefit from technology licensing revenue. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $76 million in 2014 compared to an operating loss of $101 million in 2013. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to a $323 million decrease in cost of sales, a $201 million decrease in research and development expenses and an $89 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the decrease in net revenue referenced above. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments in 2014 compared to 2013. Operating loss in 2014 included a $19 million benefit from technology licensing revenue. In addition, operating loss in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that had been previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to a similar $8 million benefit in 2014. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.2 billion in 2015 decreased by 8% compared to net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue received in connection with lower unit shipments of our server and embedded products due primarily to increased competitive pressures, as well as due to the decrease in net revenue from certain royalty arrangements and a decrease in non-recurring engineering (NRE) revenue. The decrease in net revenue was partially offset by an increase in net revenue received in connection with higher unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2014 increased by 51% compared to net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net revenue received in connection with higher unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products, which we began shipping in the second quarter of 2013.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $215 million in 2015 compared to $399 million in 2014. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above and a $16 million increase in research and development expenses, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses and a $2 million decrease in cost of sales. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decrease in unit shipments of our server and embedded products in 2015 compared to 2014, largely offset by a technology node transition charge of $33 million and an inventory write-down of $13 million. Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased and research and development expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $399 million in 2014 compared to $295 million in 2013. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $614 million increase in cost of sales, a $64 million increase in research and development expenses and a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition, operating income in 2014 included an $8 million benefit from technology license revenue. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. All OtherAll Other revenue pertains to results from former businesses, which were immaterial in 2015, 2014 and 2013. All Other operating loss of $194 million in 2015 primarily included restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million and stock-based compensation expense of $63 million. Restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million included $76 million related to our decision to exit from the dense server systems business, $37 million related to our 2015 Restructuring Plan and $16 million related to our 2014 Restructuring Plan.All Other operating loss of $478 million in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million, stock-based compensation expense of $81 million, net restructuring and other special charges of $71 million, lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of $58 million, $14 million related to workforce rebalancing severance charges, $14 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and $7 million related to other expenses.All Other operating loss of $91 million in 2013 included stock-based compensation expense of $91 million, net restructuring and other special charges of $30 million and $18 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into licenses and settlements regarding patent-related matters, for which we received in aggregate $48 million in net cash, which we recorded as an offset to operating expenses.Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net and Income Taxes The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2015, 2014 and 2013.40 2015 2014 2013 (In millions, except for percentages)Cost of sales$2,911 $3,667 $3,321Gross margin1,080 1,839 1,978Gross margin percentage27% 33% 37%Research and development947 1,072 1,201Marketing, general and administrative482 604 674Amortization of acquired intangible assets3 14 18Restructuring and other special charges, net129 71 30Goodwill impairment charge— 233 —Legal settlements, net— — (48)Interest expense(160) (177) (177)Other expense, net(5) (66) —Provision (benefit) for income taxes$14 $5 $9Gross MarginGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 27% in 2015 compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and also by lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 33% in 2014 compared to 37% in 2013. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that was previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point as compared to $8 million in 2014 which had a less than one percentage point impact. Gross margin in 2014 was adversely impacted by lower average gross margins in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment driven by increased sales of lower margin semi-custom SoC products.ExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $947 million in 2015 decreased by $125 million, or 12%, compared to $1.1 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a $120 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment and a $21 million decrease in the All Other category primarily related to a $9 million workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in 2014 and an $8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. The decrease was partially offset by a $16 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $116 million decrease in product engineering and design costs and a $4 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to a $17 million increase in product engineering and design costs.Research and development expenses of $1.1 billion in 2014 decreased by $129 million, or 11%, compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $201 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, partially offset by a $64 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $9 million increase in the All Other category related to a workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $171 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, a $22 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses and a $10 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, 41where we expect to continue to increase our investment, increased primarily due to a $59 million increase in product engineering and design costs and a $3 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expenses.Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $482 million in 2015 decreased by $122 million, or 20%, compared to $604 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to an $84 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, a $19 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $19 million decrease in the All Other category primarily related to a $5 million workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in 2014 and a $10 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $62 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $22 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment decreased primarily due to a $5 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $14 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses.Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $604 million in 2014 decreased by $70 million, or 10%, compared to $674 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to an $89 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, partially offset by a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $5 million increase in the All Other category related to a workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $61 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $25 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to an $8 million increase in sales and marketing expenses and a $5 million increase in other general and administrative expenses.Legal SettlementsAs of December 26, 2015, the Italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of our subsidiaries’ activities in Italy for the years 2003 through 2013. We have agreed to a settlement of $11 million in taxes and penalties, which was reflected in full in the 2015 tax provision and $2 million in interest.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters for which we received in aggregate $48 million in net cash, which we recorded as an offset to operating expenses. At the time we entered into the agreements, we did not have any future obligations that we were required to perform in order to earn the settlement payments. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2013.Amortization of Acquired Intangible AssetsAmortization of acquired intangible assets was $3 million in 2015, $14 million in 2014 and $18 million in 2013. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was due to the impairment of intangible assets as a result of our exit from the dense server systems business in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease from 2013 to 2014 was due to the reduced amortization base amount of acquired intangible assets of ATI. Restructuring and Other Special Charges, NetEffects of Restructuring Plans2015 Restructuring PlanIn the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan) focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. The 2015 Restructuring Plan involves a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, we recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which consisted of approximately $27 million of severance and benefit costs, approximately $1 million of facilities related consolidation charges and approximately $9 million of intangible asset related charges associated with the impairment of certain software licenses that have ongoing payment obligations. The 2015 Restructuring Plan resulted in total cash payments of $14 million in 2015. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan will likely result in total cash payments of approximately $14 million in 2016. We expect actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of 2016.42The following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2015 and the related liabilities recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015: Severanceand relatedbenefits Other exitrelatedcosts Total (In millions)Balance as of June 27, 2015$— $— $—Charges (reversals), net27 10 37Cash payments(13) (1) (14)Non-cash charges— (9) (9)Balance as of December 26, 2015$14 $— $142014 Restructuring PlanIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan (2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014 Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of our real estate footprint with our reduced headcount. We recorded a $57 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $6 million for contract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, a non-cash charge. During 2015, we recorded a $16 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $5 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $2 million for severance and related benefits and $9 million for facilities related costs. The 2014 Restructuring Plan was substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of 2015.The following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2015 and the related liabilities recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015: Severanceand relatedbenefits Other exitrelatedcosts Total (In millions)Balance as of December 27, 2014$26 $13 $39Charges (reversals), net2 14 16Cash payments(23) (7) (30)Non-cash charges— (5) (5)Balance as of December 26, 2015$5 $15 $202012 Restructuring PlanIn the fourth quarter of 2012, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve our cost structure and to strengthen our competitiveness in core growth areas. The plan primarily involved a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We recorded restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million, which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the restructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2014 and 2013, we incurred costs of $3 million and $11 million, respectively, related to facility consolidation and site closures, which were partially offset by the release of employee-related severance costs of $2 million and $5 million, respectively. The 2012 restructuring plan was substantially completed as of the end of the third quarter of 2013.Dense Server Systems Business ExitAs a part of our strategy to simplify and sharpen our investment focus, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, we recorded a charge of $76 million in “Restructuring and other special charges, net” on our consolidated statements of operations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. We concluded that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with our dense server systems business was fully impaired as we did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric technology in any of our future products nor did we have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property. In addition, the exit charge consisted of a $7 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $4 million of severance and related benefits 43and $3 million for contract or program termination costs. We expect to complete this exit activity by the end of the first quarter of 2016.Executive Officer SeparationIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded other special charges of $13 million. The amount primarily included $10 million due to the departure of our former CEO, of which $5 million was related to cash and $5 million was related to stock-based compensation expense. The amount is recorded under “Restructuring and other special charges, net” on the consolidated statements of operations.Sale and Leaseback Transactions In September 2013, we sold a light industrial building in Singapore and leased back a portion of the original space. We received net cash proceeds of $46 million in connection with the sale, which resulted in a $17 million gain that we recorded in the third quarter of 2013 and a deferred gain of $14 million as of September 28, 2013 that is being amortized over the initial operating lease term. The initial operating lease term expires in September 2023 and provides for options to extend the operating lease for 4 years at the end of the initial lease term, and for an additional 3.5 years thereafter.In September 2013, we also sold an office building in Austin, Texas. We received net cash proceeds of $10 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $5 million gain in the third quarter of 2013.In March 2013, we sold and leased back certain land and office buildings in Austin, Texas. We received net cash proceeds of $164 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $52 million charge in the first quarter of 2013. The operating lease expires in March 2025 and provides for one 10-year optional renewal.In March 2013, we also sold an office building in Markham, Ontario, Canada and leased back a portion of the original space through June 2013. We received net cash proceeds of $13 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $6 million gain in the first quarter of 2013.The net charge of $24 million recognized in 2013 related to the real estate transactions described above is recorded in the “Restructuring and other special charges, net” line item on the consolidated statements of operations.Interest ExpenseInterest expense of $160 million in 2015 decreased by $17 million compared to $177 million in 2014, primarily due to timing of issuances of new debt and repurchases of other debt in 2014.Interest expense of $177 million in 2014 was flat compared to $177 million in 2013. Other Expense, NetOther expense, net, in 2015 was $5 million compared to $66 million of other expense, net, in 2014 and $0 million of other expense, net, in 2013.In 2015, we recognized $5 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.In 2014, we recognized $66 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $61 million loss from debt repurchases and a $7 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by $3 million interest income. In 2013, we recognized $0 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $2 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a $2 million realized loss on sale of our auction rate securities (ARS) investments, offset by $5 million interest income.Income TaxesWe recorded an income tax provision of $14 million, $5 million and $9 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.The income tax provision in 2015 was primarily due to $16 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.The income tax provision in 2014 was primarily due to $7 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.The income tax provision in 2013 was primarily due to $9 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $3 million 44related to the reversal of previously recognized tax benefits associated with other comprehensive income, offset by $3 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.As of December 26, 2015, substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 26, 2015, in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved.As of December 26, 2015, the Italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of our subsidiaries’ activities in Italy for the years 2003 through 2013. We have agreed to a settlement of $11 million in taxes and penalties, which was reflected in full in the 2015 tax provision, and $2 million in interest.Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseWe allocated stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2015 2014 2013 (In millions)Cost of sales$3 $3 $5Research and development36 44 48Marketing, general and administrative24 34 38Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0$63 $81 $91During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows.Stock-based compensation expense of $63 million in 2015 decreased by $18 million as compared to $81 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a lower weighted average grant date fair value and the effect of the 2015 and 2014 Restructuring Plans.Stock-based compensation expense of $81 million in 2014 decreased by $10 million as compared to $91 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower expense related to stock options and restricted stock granted in connection with our SeaMicro acquisition as most awards became fully vested during 2014 and lower stock compensation expense as a result of our 2014 Restructuring Plan.As of December 26, 2015, we had $11 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.30 years. Also, as of December 26, 2015, we had $88 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units including performance-based restricted stock units that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.99 years.International SalesInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 75% in 2015, 81% in 2014 and 85% in 2013. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2015 compared 2014 was primarily driven by a decrease in sales in China. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in net revenue from domestic sales of our semi-custom SoC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars.FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds and commercial paper. As of December 26, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $785 million were lower compared to $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and the timing of related collections and the timing of accounts payable payments made. During 2015, we used $96 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 88% as of December 26, 2015 and 89% as of December 27, 2014.45Our debt and capital lease obligations as of December 26, 2015 were $2.3 billion as compared to $2.2 billion as of December 27, 2014. During 2015, we received $100 million net proceeds from our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, of which $42 million was used to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes.We believe our cash and cash equivalents balance along with the savings from our restructuring plans and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.Over the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business. If market conditions deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities.Operating ActivitiesNet cash used in operating activities was $226 million in 2015 compared to $98 million in 2014. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower cash collections during 2015 compared 2014 driven by lower sales compared to 2014, partially offset by lower other operating expenses and labor cost as a result of restructuring actions and the absence of the final $200 million cash payment made in the first quarter of 2014 related to GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations for wafer purchase commitments. Net cash used in operating activities was $98 million in 2014 compared to $148 million in 2013. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to higher cash collections during 2014 compared 2013 driven by slightly higher sales compared to 2013, partially offset by the $113 million prepayments to GF in the fourth quarter of 2014.Investing ActivitiesNet cash provided by investing activities was $147 million in 2015, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $235 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities, partially offset by a net cash outflow of $88 million for purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $12 million in 2014, which consisted of a cash outflow of $95 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, offset by a net cash inflow of $83 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities.Net cash provided by investing activities was $455 million in 2013 and primarily consisted of net proceeds of $301 million from the purchase, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities and net proceeds of $154 million from sales and purchases of property, plant and equipment.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities was $59 million in 2015, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $100 million, of which $42 million was used to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes during the second quarter of 2015. In addition, during 2015, we received $5 million from the exercise of employee stock options.Net cash provided by financing activities was $46 million in 2014, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our 6.75% Notes of $589 million, our 7.00% Notes of $491 million and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $75 million, partially offset by $518 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 6.00% Notes, $522 million in payments to repurchase our 8.125% Notes, $48 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.75% Notes, $24 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.50% Notes and $3 million in payments for capital lease obligations. During 2014, we also received $4 million from the exercise of employee stock options.Net cash provided by financing activities was $13 million in 2013, primarily due to net proceeds of $55 million from borrowings pursuant to our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, $3 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan and $10 million from other financing activities, including net proceeds from U.S. government grants for research and development activities and foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products. The cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of $50 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes (which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes) in open market transactions and $5 million in payments for capital lease obligations.46During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows for these periods.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 26, 2015, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period(In millions)Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021and thereafter6.75% Notes$600 $— $— $— $600 $— $—7.75% Notes450 — — — — 450 —7.50% Notes475 — — — — — 4757.00% Notes500 — — — — — 500Secured Revolving Line of Credit230 230 — — — — —Other long-term liabilities42 — 35 5 — — 2Aggregate interest obligation(1)889 148 148 148 128 106 211Operating leases306 51 50 45 28 26 106Purchase obligations(2)319 254 7 32 26 — —Obligations to GF(3)248 248 — — — — —Total contractual obligations(4)$4,059 $931 $240 $230 $782 $582 $1,294(1) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs.(2) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. In addition, we have included in the table above obligations for software technology and licenses where payments are fixed and non-cancelable.(3) Includes our purchase obligations to GF for wafer manufacturing and research and development activities and reflects the impact of wafer receipts under the fifth amendment to the WSA delayed into fiscal 2016. As of December 26, 2015, purchase obligations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $248 million, of which approximately $185 million, consisting of wafers and research and development activities, were received by December 31, 2015. We generally negotiate our purchase commitments with GF on an annual basis and as such we cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF. We are currently in the process of negotiating a sixth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. (4) Total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015On April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. In 2015, we paid off the remaining $42 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes in cash. As of December 26, 2015, we did not have any 6.00% Notes outstanding.6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019 On February 26, 2014, we issued $600 million of our 6.75% Notes. Our 6.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning September 1, 2014 until the maturity date of March 1, 2019. Our 6.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 6.75% Indenture) dated February 26, 2014 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. At any time before March 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of our 6.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as set forth in the 6.75% Indenture). As of December 26, 2015, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% Notes was $600 million.See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding our 6.75% Notes.7.75% Senior Notes Due 202047On August 4, 2010, we issued $500 million of our 7.75% Notes.

Secured Revolving Line of CreditLoan and Security AgreementWe and our subsidiary, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (together, the Borrowers), entered into a loan and security agreement on November 12, 2013, as amended on December 11, 2014 (the Loan Agreement) for our Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount of up to $500 million, with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, with a group of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., acting as agent for the lenders (the Agent). Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit had a maturity date of November 12, 2018. Borrowings under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit were limited to up to 85% of eligible account receivable minus certain reserves and may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs.Amended and Restated Loan and Security AgreementOn April 14, 2015, the Borrowers and ATI Technologies ULC (together with the Borrowers, the Loan Parties), amended and restated the Loan Agreement (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) by and among the Loan Parties, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders (the Lenders) and the Agent. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for a Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount of up to $500 million with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, which remained unchanged from the Loan Agreement. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit are limited to up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable (90% for certain qualified eligible accounts receivable), minus specified reserves. The size of the commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million. The Secured Revolving Line of Credit matures on April 14, 2020 and is secured by a first priority security interest in the Loan Parties’ accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts maintained with the Agent and other specified assets, including books and records.The Borrowers may elect a per annum interest rate equal to (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus the applicable margin set forth in the applicable chart below (the “Applicable Margin”) as determined by the average availability under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit and the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four-fiscal quarter period; or (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the Agent’s prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50%, and (z) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.00%, plus (ii) the Applicable Margin.Applicable Margin, if average availability is equal to or greater than 66.66% of the total commitment amount and the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four-fiscal quarter period is greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00, is 0.25% for Base Rate Revolver Loans and 1.25% for LIBOR Revolver Loans. Otherwise, Applicable Margin is determined in accordance with the below table:Level AverageAvailability forLast FiscalMonth Base RateRevolver Loans:Applicable Margin LIBORRevolver Loans:Applicable MarginI greater than or equal to 66.66% of the Revolver Commitment 0.5% 1.5%II greater than or equal to 33.33% of the Revolver Commitment, less than 66.66% 0.75% 1.75%III less than 33.33% of the Revolver Commitment 1% 2%The Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be optionally prepaid or terminated, and unutilized commitments may be reduced at any time, in each case without premium or penalty. In connection with the Secured Revolving Line of Credit, the Borrowers will pay an unused line fee equal to 0.375% per annum, payable monthly on the unused amount of the commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The unused line fee decreases to 0.25% per annum when 35% or more of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit is utilized. The Borrowers will pay (i) a monthly fee on all letters of credit outstanding under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit equal to the applicable LIBOR margin and (ii) a fronting fee to the Agent equal to 0.125% of all such letters of 49credit, payable monthly in arrears.The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement contains covenants that place certain restrictions on the Loan Parties’ ability to, among other things, allow certain of the Company’s subsidiaries that manufacture or process inventory for the Loan Parties to borrow secured debt or unsecured debt beyond a certain amount, amend or modify certain terms of any debt of $50 million or more or subordinated debt, create or suffer to exist any liens upon accounts or inventory, sell or transfer any of Loan Parties’ accounts or inventory other than certain ordinary-course transfers and certain supply chain finance arrangements, make certain changes to any Loan Party’s name or form or state of organization without notifying the Agent, liquidate, dissolve, merge, amalgamate, combine or consolidate, or become a party to certain agreements restricting the Loan Parties’ ability to incur or repay debt, grant liens, make distributions, or modify loan agreements. Further restrictions apply when certain payment conditions (the Payment Conditions) are not satisfied with respect to specified transactions, events or payments. The Payment Conditions include that (i) no default or event of default exists and (ii) at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction, event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction, event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith, the Loan Parties’ Excess Cash Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) is greater than the greater of 20% of the total commitment amount and $100 million. Such restrictions limit the Loan Parties’ ability to, among other things, create any liens upon any of the Loan Parties’ property other than customary permitted liens and liens on up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt (which amount includes the Secured Revolving Line of Credit), declare or make cash distributions, create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments, make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions and certain supply chain finance arrangements, make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date or become a party to certain agreements restricting the Loan Parties’ ability to enter into any non arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate. The Loan Parties are required to repurchase, redeem, defease, repay, create a segregated account for the repayment of, or request Agent to reserve a sufficient available amount under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit for the repayment of, all debt for borrowed money exceeding $50 million, by no later than 60 days prior to its maturity date (not including the Secured Revolving Line of Credit). Any reserved funds for this purpose would not be included in domestic cash calculations. In addition, if at any time the Loan Parties’ Excess Cash Availability is less than the greater of 15% of the total commitment amount and $75 million, the Loan Parties must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 until (i) no event of default exists and (ii) the Loan Parties’ Excess Cash Availability is greater than the greater of 15% of the total commitment amount and $75 million for 45 consecutive days. The events of default under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement include, among other things, payment defaults, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, a cross-default related to indebtedness in an aggregate amount in excess of $50 million, judgments entered against a Loan Party in an amount that exceeds cumulatively $50 million, certain ERISA events and events related to Canadian defined benefits plans and a change of control. When a Payment Condition has not been satisfied, additional events of default include, among other things, a loss, theft damage or destruction with respect to any collateral if the amount not covered by insurance exceeds $50 million. First Amendment to Amendment and Restated Loan and Security Agreement On June 10, 2015, the Loan Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “First Amendment”) by and among the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agent, which modifies the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. Amendments to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement effected by the First Amendment include the addition of exceptions to the liens and asset sale covenants to permit the Loan Parties to enter into certain supply chain finance arrangements, as well as the addition of certain definitions related thereto.At December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $230 million and $130 million, respectively, at an interest rate of 4.00% and 4.25%, respectively. At December 26, 2015, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit also had $16 million related to outstanding Letters of Credit, and up to $87 million available for future borrowings. We report our intra-period changes in our revolving credit balance on a net basis in our consolidated statement of cash flows as we intend the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. As of December 26, 2015, we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Loan Agreement.The agreements governing the 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the 50applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.Other Long-Term LiabilitiesOther long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above primarily consisted of $40 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2018. Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above exclude amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 26, 2015, primarily consisted of $18 million of deferred gains resulting from certain real estate transactions that occurred in Sunnyvale, California in 1998, in Markham, Ontario, Canada in 2015 and 2008 and in Singapore in 2013. Accruals related to facility consolidation and site closure costs under our restructuring plans of $7 million, deferred rent related to our facilities in Sunnyvale, California of $6 million and operating lease accruals of $5 million are excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above as they are included in the operating leases obligations. Also excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above are $4 million of environmental reserves and $4 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which represent potential cash payments that could be payable by us upon settlements with the related authorities. We have not included these amounts in the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of the settlements with the related authorities, if any.Capital Lease ObligationsWe terminated our capital lease obligations and entered into a non-cancelable operating lease agreement related to one of our facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada during 2015. As of December 26, 2015, we did not have any capital lease obligations outstanding.Operating LeasesWe lease certain of our facilities, and in some jurisdictions, we lease the land on which these facilities are built under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. We lease certain manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 26, 2015 were $306 million, including approximately $251 million of future lease payments and estimated operating costs related to real estate transactions that occurred in Austin, Texas, Sunnyvale, California, Markham, Canada and Singapore.Purchase ObligationsOur purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties, excluding our wafer purchase commitments to GF under the WSA. As of December 26, 2015, total non-cancelable purchase obligations were $319 million.Obligations to GFObligations to GF represent all of our expected cash payments to GF based on wafer receipts and research and development activities. As of December 26, 2015, purchase obligations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $248 million, of which amount wafers and research and development activities of approximately $185 million were received by December 31, 2015. We are currently in the process of negotiating a sixth amendment to the WSA and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 26, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.51ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 26, 2015, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.As of December 26, 2015, the majority of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 26, 2015, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2015.The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 26, 2015: 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 and thereafter Total 2015Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages)Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts$376 $— $— $— $— $— $376 $376Weighted-average rate0.27% — — — — — 0.27% 0.27%Total Investment Portfolio$376 $— $— $— $— $— $376 $376Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts$— $— $— $600 $450 $975 $2,025 $1,372Weighted-average effective interest rate—% —% —% 6.75% 7.75% 7.24% 6.88% 10.64%Variable rate amounts$230 $— $— $— $— $— $230 $230Weighted-average effective interest rate4.00% —% —% —% —% —% —% 4.00%Total Debt Obligations$230 $— $— $600 $450 $975 $2,255 $1,602Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy, which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.In applying our strategy, from time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings.52We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

The notional amount of the interest rate swap we entered into was $250 million as of December 26, 2015. The interest rate swaps are designated as a fair value hedge. All changes in fair value of the swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets with no net impact to our consolidated statements of operations.53",2023-12-30 17:45:41.861692
2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2017,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”IntroductionWe are a global semiconductor company primarily offering:(i)x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) and professional graphics; and(ii)server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles. We also license portions of our intellectual property portfolio. In this MD&A, we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. Overview As we continued to focus on our strategy to improve our business, we made progress towards strengthening our competitive position and improving our financial performance in 2016. Net revenue for 2016 was $4.3 billion, an increase of 7% compared to 2015 net revenue of $4.0 billion. The increase in net revenue from 2015 was due to a 9% increase in Computing and Graphics segment revenue and a 5% increase in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue. Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased year-over-year primarily due to higher GPU sales, offset by lower microprocessor sales. Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue increased year-over-year primarily due to higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2016, was 23% compared to 27% in 2015. The decrease in gross margin in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $340 million charge taken in the third quarter of 2016 (the WSA Charge) related to the sixth amendment to the wafer supply agreement (the Sixth Amendment) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). Operating loss for 2016 was $372 million compared to a $481 million for 2015. This improvement in operating performance in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to an increase in net revenue described above, a reduction in restructuring and other special charges, net and a licensing gain related to an intellectual property license agreement in connection with the joint ventures in China that we formed with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. Ltd. (THATIC), partially offset by an increase in cost of sales due to the WSA Charge. During 2016, we continued to closely manage our operating expenses. Our operating expenses in 2016 decreased to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 2015, due to the absence of restructuring charges in 2016, partially offset by increased R&D expenses. In 2016, we continued to improve our balance sheet by reducing our debt and extending our debt maturities. During the third quarter of 2016, we issued $690 million of common stock and $805 million aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes). We used the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and the 2.125% Notes to pay $230 million of our secured revolving line of credit and repurchase an aggregate principal amount of $796 million of our outstanding 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes), 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes), 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes) and 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes). In the fourth quarter of 2016, we redeemed the remaining $208 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Notes and as a result, we no longer have any 7.75% Notes outstanding. Total debt as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.4 billion, compared to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 were $1.3 billion compared to $785 million at December 26, 2015. During 2016, we continued to execute our roadmap by delivering a number of new products and technologies across our two business segments. In March 2016, we announced new additions to our desktop processor family, with the AMD A10-7890K APU designed to help enable smooth play of online games and the AMD Athlon X4 880K APU that features our ""Excavator"" x86 architecture. Also in March, we introduced the Radeon Pro Duo GPU with the LiquidVR SDK platform designed for many aspects of VR content creation: from entertainment to education, journalism, medicine and cinema. In May 2016, we introduced our mobile 7th Generation A-Series processors. Our 7th Generation A-Series processors are designed to provide productivity and entertainment performance with maximum mobility for consumers. Also in May, we introduced an AMD Multiuser GPU (MxGPU) for blade servers, the AMD FirePro S7100X GPU, designed to provide a “workstation-class” experience for up to 16 users. We launched our first GPU featuring our Polaris architecture, the Radeon™ RX 480 GPU, in June 2016. Our Polaris architecture features our latest 4th Gen Graphics Core Next (GCN), along with the latest display technology support and performance per watt 35capabilities, all based on a FinFET 14 process technology. In July 2016, we revealed our new Radeon Pro SSG GPU with the ability to expand GPU storage up to 1 terabyte (TB) and which is designed for media and entertainment professionals. We also announced our new Radeon Pro WX series GPUs, which are based on our Polaris architecture and designed for workstation professionals and creators. In August 2016, we introduced the new Radeon RX 470, targeted at high definition (HD) resolutions for gamers. Also in August 2016, we released the new Radeon RX 460 graphics card with an ultra-quiet cooling solution and sub-75W power footprint for mainstream and e-sports gaming. We announced two new AMD Embedded Radeon graphics cards, the AMD Embedded Radeon E9260 and the AMD Embedded Radeon E9550 discrete GPU products in September 2016. These GPUs bring our Polaris architecture to the embedded markets and are designed to elevate the level of GPU processing performance available to embedded customers. In October 2016, we announced the first PCs featuring 7th Generation AMD PRO APUs. These APUs are built for businesses and designed to deliver increased computing and graphics performance and improved energy efficiency.In connection with our plans to further sharpen our focus and operations on designing high-performance products, we entered into a definitive agreement to form two joint ventures with Tongfu Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (formerly, Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd.) (TFME) in the third quarter of 2015. In April 2016, we completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in Suzhou TF AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (formerly, AMD Technologies (China) Co., Ltd.) and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. (formerly, Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd.), to affiliates of TFME to form two joint ventures (collectively, ATMP JV). As a result of the sale, TFME’s affiliates own 85% of the equity interests in the ATMP JV while certain of our subsidiaries own the remaining 15%. We received approximately $342 million, including purchase price adjustments, in net cash proceeds for selling 85% of the equity interest in the ATMP JV.In February 2016, as part of our IP monetization strategy, we and THATIC formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). Our equity share in China JV1 and China JV2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by our contribution of certain of our patents. The THATIC JV’s primary purpose is to support our expansion into the server product market in China. We also licensed certain of our intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of approximately $293 million in license fees payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. We also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP. We will also provide certain engineering and technical support to the THATIC JV in connection with the product development. In addition, we entered into a Sixth Amendment with GF during the third quarter of 2016. The Sixth Amendment modifies certain terms of the wafer supply agreement applicable to wafers for our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five-year period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. Also, in connection with and in consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the Sixth Amendment, we entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) pursuant to which WCH received the right to purchase up to 75 million shares of our common stock.We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. GLOBALFOUNDRIESFormation and Accounting On March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Mubadala Technology Investments LLC, or Mubadala Tech, (formerly, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC) and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), pursuant to which we formed GF. In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD, Mubadala Tech and GF entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement) and a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement) on March 2, 2009.On March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, we transferred to GF all of the remaining capital stock of GF that we owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and we were no longer party to the Shareholders’ Agreement. As a result of these transactions, we no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012. GF continues to be a related party of us because Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, our largest stockholder. WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala.Wafer Supply Agreement 36The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures microprocessor and APU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and APU products to GF.The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply.Sixth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On August 30, 2016, we entered into a sixth amendment (the Sixth Amendment) to the WSA. The Sixth Amendment modifies certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five-year period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. AMD and GF agreed to establish a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration for the 7nm technology node.The Sixth Amendment also provides us a limited waiver with rights to contract with another wafer foundry with respect to certain products in the 14nm and 7nm technology nodes and gives us greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio. In consideration for these rights, we agreed to pay GF $100 million in installments starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the third fiscal quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we paid GF $25 million. Starting in 2017 and continuing through 2020, we also agreed to make quarterly payments to GF based on the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry.Further, for each calendar year during the term of the Sixth Amendment, AMD and GF agreed to annual wafer purchase targets that increase from 2016 through 2020. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any calendar year, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. The annual targets were established based on our current business and market expectations and take into account the limited waiver we have received for certain products.AMD and GF also agreed on fixed pricing for wafers purchased during 2016 and established a framework to agree on annual wafer pricing for the years 2017 to 2020. Our total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities were approximately $0.7 billion for 2016, $0.9 billion for 2015 and $1.0 billion for 2014.Warrant Agreement. Also on August 30, 2016, in consideration of the limited waiver and rights under the Sixth Amendment, we entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with WCH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala. Under the Warrant Agreement, WCH and its permitted assigns are entitled to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock (the Warrant Shares) at a purchase price of $5.98 per share. The warrant under the Warrant Agreement is exercisable in whole or in part until February 29, 2020, provided that the maximum number of Warrant Shares that may be exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the Warrant Agreement shall not exceed 50 million. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Warrant Agreement will only be exercisable to the extent that Mubadala does not beneficially own, either directly through any other entities directly and indirectly owned by Mubadala or its subsidiaries, an aggregate of more than 19.99% of our outstanding capital stock after any such exercise.During 2016, we recorded a charge of $340 million, consisting of the $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the Warrant Agreement issued in consideration of the Sixth Amendment.Equity Interest Purchase Agreement - ATMP Joint VentureOn April 29, 2016, we and certain of our subsidiaries completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in Suzhou TF-AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (formerly, AMD Technologies (China) Co., Ltd.), and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. (formerly, Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd.), to affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (formerly, Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd.) (TFME), a Chinese joint stock company, to form two joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JV). As a result of the sale, TFME’s affiliates own 85% of the equity interests in the ATMP JV while certain of our subsidiaries own the remaining 15%. We have no obligations to fund the ATMP JV.As a result of the transaction, we received approximately $342 million, including purchase price adjustments, in net cash proceeds for selling 85% of the equity interest in each of Suzhou TF-AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. These proceeds, net of certain transaction costs, were included in investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016.We recognized a net pre-tax gain on the sale of the 85% equity interest in ATMP JV of $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was recognized in Other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. The net pre-tax gain reflects the excess of the sum of net cash proceeds and fair value of our retained 15% equity interests in the ATMP JV over the sum of the net book values of our former subsidiaries and other closing costs directly attributed to the divestiture. The above gain includes $11 million in excess of fair value of our retained interest over the corresponding net book values. In determining the fair value of our retained 15% equity interests in the ATMP JV, we used quoted prices from comparable bids for this transaction. We also considered other factors including the control premium and the amount of consideration received for the portion sold.We account for our equity interests in the ATMP JV under the equity method of accounting due to our significant influence over the ATMP JV. As of December 31, 2016, the carrying value of our investment in the ATMP JV was approximately $59 million. Following the deconsolidation, the ATMP JV is our related party. The ATMP JV provides assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) services to us. We currently pay the ATMP JV for ATMP services on a cost-plus basis. Our total purchases from the ATMP JV during the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to approximately $265 million. Our payable to the ATMP JV, as of December 31, 2016, was $128 million.During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $10 million loss in Equity in income (loss) of ATMP JV on our consolidated statements of operations, which included certain expenses incurred by us on behalf of the ATMP JV.Equity Joint Venture - Intellectual Property Licensing AgreementIn February 2016, we and THATIC, a third-party Chinese entity (JV Partner), formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). Our equity share in China JV1 and China JV2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by our contribution of certain of our patents. The JV Partner is responsible for the initial and on-going financing of the THATIC JV’s operations. We have no obligations to fund the THATIC JV. The THATIC JV’s primary purpose is to support our expansion into the server and workstation product market in China. We licensed certain of our intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of approximately $293 million in license fees payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. We also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP. We will also provide certain engineering and technical support to the THATIC JV in connection with the product development. We concluded the China JV1 and China JV2 are not operating joint ventures and are variable interest entities due to their reliance on on-going financing by JV Partner. We determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of either China JV1 or China JV2, as we do not have unilateral power to direct selling and marketing activities, manufacturing and product development activities related to the THATIC JV's products. Accordingly we will not consolidate either of these entities and therefore account for our investments in the THATIC JV under the equity method of accounting. THATIC JV is our related party.Income related to the Licensed IP will be recognized over the period commencing upon delivery of the first Licensed IP milestone through the date of the milestone that requires our continuing involvement in the product development process. Royalty payments will be recognized in income once earned. We will classify Licensed IP income and royalty income as other operating income. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $88 million of licensing gain associated with the THATIC JV as part of operating income. Our total exposure to losses through our investment in the THATIC JV is limited to our investments in the THATIC JV, which was zero as of December 31, 2016. Our share in the net losses of the THATIC JV for the year ended December 31, 2016 was not material and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of operations since we are not obligated to fund the THATIC JV's losses in excess of our investment in the THATIC JV. As of December 31, 2016, the total assets and liabilities of the THATIC JV were not material.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments 37about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. In assessing impairment on goodwill, we first analyze qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The qualitative factors we assess include long-term prospects of our performance, share price trends, market capitalization and Company-specific events. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not need to perform the two-step impairment test. If based on that assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed. The first step measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market condition. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. Based on the results of our annual qualitative analysis of goodwill in 2016, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and, as such, we did not need to perform the two-step impairment test and there was no goodwill impairment. Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2015, each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment. 38Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014, we determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of $233 million was recorded, which represented the entire goodwill balance within this reporting unit. The remaining two reporting units’ estimated fair values exceeded their carrying value, ranging from approximately 156% to approximately 209%. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 28, 2014, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.Estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. Potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment.Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.Results of OperationsManagement, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net, income taxes and equity in income (loss) of ATMP JV. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. We have the following two reportable segments:•the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics; and•the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom SoC products, development services, technology for game consoles and licensing portions of our intellectual property portfolio.In addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. Included in this category are employee stock-based compensation expense, the charge related to the Sixth Amendment to the WSA with GF, restructuring and other special charges, net, amortization of acquired intangible assets, workforce rebalancing severance charges, goodwill impairment charge and significant or unusual lower of cost or market inventory adjustments. We also reported the results of former businesses in the All Other category because the operating results were not material. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.We use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 included 53 weeks, 52 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. The extra week in 2016 did not have a material impact on our results of operations. References in this report to 2016, 2015 and 2014 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise.The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of ATMP JV for 2016, 2015 and 2014. 2016 2015 2014 (In millions)Net revenue: Computing and Graphics$1,967 $1,805 $3,132Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom2,305 2,186 2,374Total net revenue$4,272 $3,991 $5,506Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics$(238) $(502) $(76)Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom283 215 399All Other(417) (194) (478)Total operating loss$(372) $(481) $(155)Interest expense(156) (160) (177)Other income (expense), net80 (5) (66)Loss before income taxes and equity income (loss) of ATMP JV$(448) $(646) $(398)Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics net revenue of $2.0 billion in 2016 increased by 9% compared to $1.8 billion in 2015 as a result of a 9% increase in unit shipments, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average selling price. The increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to higher unit shipments of our GPU products, partially offset by lower unit shipments of our microprocessor products. The increase of unit shipments of our GPU products was primarily driven by demand for our Polaris architecture-based GPU products. The decrease in unit shipments of our microprocessor products was primarily due to lower unit shipments of our desktop microprocessor products due to lower demand, partially offset by higher shipments of notebook microprocessor products driven by higher demand for our 7th Generation A-Series notebook processors. The decrease in average selling price was primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling price of our desktop microprocessor and notebook GPU products due to a shift in our product mix, partially offset by an increase in average selling price of our channel GPU products primarily due to strong demand for our Polaris architecture-based GPU products.Computing and Graphics net revenue of $1.8 billion in 2015 decreased by 42% compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 as a result of a 44% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by a 3% increase in average selling price. Unit shipments of all our Computing and Graphics products decreased. The decrease in unit shipments of all categories of products was due to lower demand caused by challenging global macro-economic conditions, especially in the Greater China region, in addition to increased competitive pressures and reduced demand from our OEM customers in advance of the Microsoft Windows® 10 operating system. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our notebook GPU products and channel GPU products due to a shift in our product mix, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of our notebook microprocessor products and chipset products.Computing and Graphics operating loss was $238 million in 2016 compared to an operating loss of $502 million in 2015. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above and a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of sales primarily due to higher sales in 2016 compared to 2015. In 2015, cost of sales included an inventory write-down of $52 million as a result of lower than anticipated demand for primarily older-generation APU products. Operating expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.Computing and Graphics operating loss was $502 million in 2015 compared to an operating loss of $76 million in 2014. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $696 million decrease in cost of sales and a decrease in operating expenses. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by an inventory write-down of $52 million as a result of lower anticipated demand for primarily older-generation APU products. Operating loss in 2014 included a $19 million benefit from technology licensing revenue. Operating expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.3 billion in 2016 increased by 5% compared to net revenue of $2.2 billion in 2015. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products and non-recurring engineering (NRE) revenue. The increase in unit shipments was primarily driven by increased demand.39Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.2 billion in 2015 decreased by 8% compared to net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue received in connection with lower unit shipments of our server and embedded products due primarily to increased competitive pressures, as well as a decrease in net revenue from certain royalty arrangements and a decrease in NRE revenue. The decrease in net revenue was partially offset by an increase in net revenue received in connection with higher unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $283 million in 2016 compared to $215 million in 2015. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, an $88 million licensing gain recorded in 2016 related to the Licensed IP to the THATIC JV, and a decrease in cost of sales, in part due to the absence of a technology node transition charge of $33 million recorded in 2015, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $215 million in 2015 compared to $399 million in 2014. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and a decrease in cost of sales. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decrease in unit shipments of our server and embedded products in 2015 compared to 2014, largely offset by a technology node transition charge of $33 million and an inventory write-down of $13 million. Operating expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.All OtherAll Other operating loss of $417 million in 2016 included a charge of $340 million, which was comprised of the $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the Warrant Agreement, and stock-based compensation expense of $86 million, partially offset by restructuring reversals of $10 million. All Other operating loss of $194 million in 2015 included restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million and stock-based compensation expense of $63 million. Restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million included $76 million related to our decision to exit from the dense server systems business, $37 million related to our 2015 Restructuring Plan and $16 million related to our 2014 Restructuring Plan.All Other operating loss of $478 million in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million, stock-based compensation expense of $81 million, restructuring and other special charges, net of $71 million, lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of $58 million, workforce rebalancing severance charges of $14 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $14 million and other expenses of $7 million.Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net Income Taxes and Equity in Income (Loss) of ATMP JV The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2016, 2015 and 2014. 2016 2015 2014 (In millions, except for percentages)Cost of sales$3,274 $2,911 $3,667Gross margin998 1,080 1,839Gross margin percentage23% 27% 33%Research and development1,008 947 1,072Marketing, general and administrative460 482 604Amortization of acquired intangible assets— 3 14Restructuring and other special charges, net(10) 129 71Licensing gain(88) — —Goodwill impairment charge— — 233Interest expense(156) (160) (177)Other income (expense), net80 (5) (66)Provision for income taxes39 14 5Equity in income (loss) of ATMP JV$(10) $— $—Gross MarginGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 23% in 2016 compared to 27% in 2015. Gross margin in 2016 was adversely impacted by a charge of $340 million, which is comprised of a $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the value of the warrant of $240 million under the Warrant Agreement. The impact of the charge accounted for eight gross margin percentage points. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the inventory write-down and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points. In the absence of these charges, the gross margin would have increased by two percentage points, primarily driven by improved product mix. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 27% in 2015 compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and also by lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. ExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $1.0 billion in 2016 increased by $61 million, or 6%, compared to $0.9 billion in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $138 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $13 million increase attributable to our All Other category, partially offset by a $90 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to a $128 million increase in product engineering and design costs. Research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category increased primarily due to a $13 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $108 million decrease in product engineering and design costs. Research and development expenses of $947 million in 2015 decreased by $125 million, or 12%, compared to $1.1 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a $120 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment and a $21 million decrease in the All Other category primarily related to a $9 million workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in 2014 and an $8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. The decrease was partially offset by a $16 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $116 million decrease in product engineering and design costs and a $4 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to a $17 million increase in product engineering and design costs.Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $460 million in 2016 decreased by $22 million, or 5%, compared to $482 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $40 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment primarily due to an $18 million decrease in sales and marketing activities and a $22 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $6 million increase in other general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $12 million increase attributable to our All Other category primarily due to an $11 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $482 million in 2015 decreased by $122 million, or 20%, compared to $604 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to an $84 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, a $19 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $19 million decrease in the All Other category primarily related to a $5 million workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in 2014 and a $10 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment 40decreased primarily due to a $62 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $22 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment decreased primarily due to a $5 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $14 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses.Legal SettlementsAs of December 26, 2015, the Italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of our subsidiaries’ activities in Italy for the years 2003 through 2013. We entered into a settlement for $11 million in taxes and penalties, which was reflected in full in the 2015 tax provision and $2 million in interest.Amortization of Acquired Intangible AssetsAmortization of acquired intangible assets was $0 million in 2016, $3 million in 2015 and $14 million in 2014. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was due to the impairment of intangible assets as a result of our exit from the dense server systems business in the first quarter of 2015. The related intangible assets were fully amortized as of December 26, 2015.Restructuring and Other Special Charges, NetEffects of Restructuring Plans2015 Restructuring PlanIn the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan) focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. The 2015 Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and included organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, we recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $27 million for severance and benefit costs, $1 million for facilities-related costs and $9 million for intangible asset-related charges. The actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017.The following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2016 and the related liabilities recorded in Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016: Severanceand relatedbenefits Other exitrelatedcosts Total (In millions)Balance as of December 26, 2015$14 $— $14Charges (reversals), net(1) — (1)Cash payments(10) — (10)Balance as of December 31, 2016$3 $— $32014 Restructuring PlanIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan (2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014 Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of our real estate footprint with our reduced headcount. We recorded a $57 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $6 million for contract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities-related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, a non-cash charge. During 2015, we recorded a $16 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $5 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $2 million for severance and related benefits and $9 million for facilities-related costs. The 2014 Restructuring Plan was completed during the third quarter of 2015.The following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2016 and the related liabilities recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016: Severanceand relatedbenefits Other exitrelatedcosts Total (In millions)Balance as of December 26, 2015$5 $15 $20Charges (reversals), net(2) (7) (9)Cash payments(1) (6) (7)Balance as of December 31, 2016$2 $2 $4Dense Server Systems Business ExitAs a part of our strategy to simplify and sharpen our investment focus, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, we recorded a charge of $76 million in “Restructuring and other special charges, net” on our consolidated statements of operations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. We concluded that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with our dense server systems business was fully impaired as we did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric technology in any of our future products nor did we have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property. In addition, the exit charge consisted of a $7 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $4 million of severance and related benefits and $3 million for contract or program termination costs. We substantially completed this exit activity during the second quarter of 2016.Executive Officer SeparationIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded other special charges of $13 million. The amount primarily included $10 million due to the departure of our former CEO, of which $5 million was related to cash and $5 million was related to stock-based compensation expense. The amount is recorded under “Restructuring and other special charges, net” on the consolidated statements of operations.Interest ExpenseInterest expense of $156 million in 2016 decreased by $4 million compared to $160 million in 2015, primarily due to the repurchases of debt bearing higher interest rates and issuance of new debt at a lower interest rate in late 2016.Interest expense of $160 million in 2015 decreased by $17 million compared to $177 million in 2014, primarily due to timing of issuances of new debt and repurchases of other debt in 2014.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2016, we recognized $80 million of other income, net, primarily due to the net gain on sale of equity interests in the ATMP JV of $146 million, partially offset by the $68 million total loss on debt repurchases.In 2015, we recognized $5 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.In 2014, we recognized $66 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $61 million loss from debt repurchases and a $7 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by $3 million of interest income.Income TaxesWe recorded an income tax provision of $39 million, $14 million and $5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.The income tax provision in 2016 was primarily due to $41 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $27 million attributable to gain on the sale of 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in Suzhou and $9 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions where no foreign tax credit is expected to be available, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.The income tax provision in 2015 was primarily due to $16 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.The income tax provision in 2014 was primarily due to $7 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.As of December 31, 2016, substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 31, 2016, in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved.As of December 26, 2015, the Italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of our subsidiaries’ activities in Italy for the years 2003 through 2013. We entered into a settlement for $11 million in taxes and penalties, which was reflected in full in the 2015 tax provision, and $2 million in interest.Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseWe allocated stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions)Cost of sales$2 $3 $3Research and development49 36 44Marketing, general and administrative35 24 34Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0$86 $63 $81During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows.Stock-based compensation expense of $86 million in 2016 increased by $23 million as compared to $63 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a higher weighted average grant date fair value and higher number of shares related to restricted stock units granted in 2016, compared to the restricted stock units granted in 2013, which became fully amortized in 2016. The increase was also driven by performance-based restricted stock units with market conditions granted in 2015 and 2016.Stock-based compensation expense of $63 million in 2015 decreased by $18 million as compared to $81 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a lower weighted average grant date fair value and the effect of the 2015 and 2014 Restructuring Plans.International SalesInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 78% in 2016, 75% in 2015 and 81% in 2014. The increase in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from international sales of our semi-custom SoC products. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by a decrease in sales in China. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars.FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash, government money market funds and commercial paper. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 were $1.3 billion compared to $785 million as of December 26, 2015. The increase during the year was due to net cash provided by our operating, investing and financing activities discussed below. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 98% as of December 31, 2016, and 88% as of December 26, 2015.Our cash flows for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$90 $(226) $(98)Investing activities267 147 (12)Financing activities122 59 46Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$479 $(20) $(64)Our debt obligations of $1.4 billion net of unamortized debt discount of $308 million associated with the 2.125% Notes as of December 31, 2016 decreased compared to $2.2 billion as of December 26, 2015.We believe our cash and cash equivalents balance along with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.Should we require additional funding, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business. If market conditions deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $90 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $226 million in 2015. The improvement in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to lower operating expenses, including lower labor costs and lower restructuring-related payments, receipt of $97 million associated with the licensing agreement with THATIC JV and higher sales and timing of related collections, partially offset by timing of accounts payable payments.Net cash used in operating activities was $226 million in 2015 compared to $98 million in 2014. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower cash collections during 2015 compared 2014 driven by lower sales compared to 2014, partially offset by lower other operating expenses and labor cost as a result of restructuring actions and the absence of the final $200 million cash payment made in the first quarter of 2014 related to GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations for wafer purchase commitments.Investing Activities41Net cash provided by investing activities was $267 million in 2016, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $342 million from sale of equity interests in the ATMP JV, partially offset by a cash outflow of $77 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.Net cash provided by investing activities was $147 million in 2015, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $235 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities, partially offset by a net cash outflow of $88 million for purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $12 million in 2014, which consisted of a cash outflow of $95 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, offset by a net cash inflow of $83 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities was $122 million in 2016, primarily due to the $782 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 2.125% Notes, the $667 million net proceeds from selling 115 million shares of our common stock and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion of our outstanding 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes and 7.00% Notes for $1.1 billion in cash and repayments in aggregate of $230 million of our Secured Revolving Line of Credit.Net cash provided by financing activities was $59 million in 2015, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $100 million, of which $42 million was used to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes) during the second quarter of 2015. In addition, during 2015, we received $5 million from the exercise of employee stock options.Net cash provided by financing activities was $46 million in 2014, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our 6.75% Notes of $589 million, our 7.00% Notes of $491 million and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $75 million, partially offset by $518 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 6.00% Notes, $522 million in payments to repurchase our 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (8.125% Notes), $48 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.75% Notes, $24 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.50% Notes and $3 million in payments for capital lease obligations. During 2014, we also received $4 million from the exercise of employee stock options.During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows for these periods.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 31, 2016, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period(In millions)Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 and thereafter6.75% Notes$196 $— $— $196 $— $— $—7.50% Notes 350 — — — — — 3507.00% Notes416 — — — — — 4162.125% Notes805 — — — — — 805Other long-term liabilities93 — 49 36 6 — 2Aggregate interest obligation (1)601 88 88 81 73 72 199Operating leases388 49 51 46 43 64 135Purchase obligations (2)447 391 37 15 3 1 —Obligations to GF (3)3,256 964 748 764 780 — —Total contractual obligations (4)$6,552 $1,492 $973 $1,138 $905 $137 $1,907 (1) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs.

We also granted an option to the underwriters to purchase up to an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes. On September 28, 2016, this option was exercised in full and we issued an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes.Our 2.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and will mature on September 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted.

Secured Revolving Line of CreditLoan and Security Agreement44We and our subsidiary, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (together, the Borrowers), entered into a loan and security agreement on November 12, 2013, as amended on December 11, 2014 (the Loan Agreement) for our secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount of up to $500 million (the Secured Revolving Line of Credit), with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, with a group of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., acting as agent for the lenders (the Agent). Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit had a maturity date of November 12, 2018. Borrowings under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit were limited to up to 85% of eligible account receivable minus certain reserves and may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs.Amended and Restated Loan and Security AgreementOn April 14, 2015, the Borrowers and ATI Technologies ULC (collectively, the Loan Parties), amended and restated the Loan Agreement (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) by and among the Loan Parties, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders (the Lenders) and the Agent.The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for a Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount up to $500 million with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, which remained unchanged from the Loan Agreement. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit are limited to up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable (90% for certain qualified eligible accounts receivable), minus specified reserves. The size of the commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million.The Secured Revolving Line of Credit matures on April 14, 2020 and is secured by a first priority security interest in the Loan Parties’ accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts maintained with the Agent and other specified assets, including books and records.During 2016, we repaid an aggregate of $230 million of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. At December 31, 2016, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. At December 26, 2015, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $230 million, at an interest rate of 4.00%. At December 31, 2016, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had $19 million related to outstanding letters of credit and up to $121 million available for future borrowings. We report our intra-period changes in our revolving credit balance on a net basis in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as we intend the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.The agreements governing our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 2.125% Notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security AgreementOn June 10, 2015, the Loan Parties entered into a first amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment) by and among the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agent, which modifies the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement. Amendments to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement effected by the First Amendment included the addition of exceptions to the liens and asset sale covenants to permit the Loan Parties to enter into certain supply chain finance arrangements, as well as the addition of certain definitions related thereto. Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security AgreementOn April 29, 2016, the Loan Parties entered into a second amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Second Amendment) by and among the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agent, which modifies the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement. The primary amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement effected by the Second Amendment related to the expansion of the definition of permitted asset dispositions to include the sale or transfer of inventory to the ATMP JV pursuant to the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement between us and TFME.Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security AgreementOn June 21, 2016, the Loan Parties entered into a third amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Third Amendment) by and among the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agent, which modifies the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement. Amendments to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement effected by the Third Amendment included the further expansion of the asset sale covenants to permit the Loan Parties to enter into certain supply chain finance arrangements. 45Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement On September 7, 2016, the Loan Parties entered into a fourth amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Fourth Amendment) by and among the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agent, which modifies the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement. The primary amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan agreement effected by the Fourth Amendment was to increase the dollar limit as set forth the definition related to certain supply chain finance arrangements.Other Long-Term LiabilitiesOther long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above primarily consisted of $91 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2020. Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above exclude amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 31, 2016, primarily consisted of $13 million of deferred gains resulting from certain real estate transactions that occurred in Markham, Ontario, Canada in 2015 and 2008 and in Singapore in 2013, partially offset by $10 million of interest accretion for future payments related to software and technology licenses. Operating lease accruals of $6 million and deferred rent related to our facilities in Sunnyvale, California of $4 million are excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above as they are included in the operating leases obligations. Also excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above are $11 million of deferred tax liabilities, $3 million of environmental reserves and $3 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which represent potential cash payments that could be payable by us upon settlements with the related authorities. We have not included these amounts in the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of the settlements with the related authorities, if any.Operating LeasesWe lease certain of our facilities and, in some jurisdictions, we lease the land on which our facilities are built under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. We lease certain office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 31, 2016 were $388 million, including $328 million of future lease payments and estimated operating costs related to the real estate transactions that occurred in Austin, Texas, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara, California, Markham, Canada, and Singapore. During the second quarter of 2016, we signed an amendment to the lease agreement associated with our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California so that the lease expires in December 2017. In connection with the amendment, the lease payments were reduced for 2017. During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a 10-year operating lease to occupy 220,000 square feet of new office space in Santa Clara. Base rent obligation is estimated to commence in August 2017 and the total estimate base rent payments over the life of the lease are approximately $125 million. In addition to the base rent payments we will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for our share of operating expenses and tax obligation. We will also incur costs for capital projects on the new office space. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for an additional two five-year periods.Purchase ObligationsOur purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties, excluding our wafer purchase commitments to GF under the WSA. As of December 31, 2016, total non-cancelable purchase obligations were $447 million.Obligations to GFAs of December 31, 2016, our minimum wafer purchase obligations for the years 2017 through 2020 are approximately $3.3 billion. We cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF beyond this amount but expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.46ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 31, 2016, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.As of December 31, 2016, all of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 31, 2016, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2016.The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 31, 2016: 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 and thereafter Total 2016Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages)Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts$1,147 $— $— $— $— $— $1,147 $1,147Weighted-average rate0.68% — — — — — 0.68% 0.68%Variable rate amounts$50 $— $— $— $— $— $50 $50Weighted-average rate0.42% — — — — — 0.42% 0.42%Total Investment Portfolio$1,197 $— $— $— $— $— $1,197 $1,197Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts$— $— $196 $— $— $1,571 $1,767 $2,313Weighted-average effective interest rate—% —% 6.75% —% —% 7.62% 7.53% 5.75%Variable rate amounts$— $— $— $— $— $— $— $—Weighted-average effective interest rate—% —% —% —% —% —% —% —%Total Debt Obligations$— $— $196 $— $— $1,571 $1,767 $2,313Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy, which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.In applying our strategy, from time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of 47the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings.We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2018,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”IntroductionWe are a global semiconductor company primarily offering:•x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and•server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles. We also license portions of our intellectual property (IP) portfolio. In this management 's discussion and analysis (MD&A), we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. Overview 2017 was an important year for AMD as we launched a number of new high-performance products that re-shaped our product portfolio and improved our technology competitiveness. We launched more than 40 new high-performance CPUs and GPUs and experienced strong customer acceptance of our new products. We launched our first-generation AMD Ryzen™ desktop CPUs based on our entirely new “Zen” x86 CPU core architecture. We released our AMD Ryzen™ 7 desktop processors designed for PC gamers, creators and the enthusiast market. We also launched our high performance AMD Ryzen™ 5 desktop processors at a variety of price points with up to 6 cores and 12 threads of CPU processing in April 2017. We released our AMD Ryzen™ 3 desktop processors in July 2017 designed to bring “Zen” processing power to mainstream price points. In August 2017, we launched the Ryzen™ Threadripper™ family of high-end desktop processors. For the commercial market, we launched AMD Ryzen™ PRO desktop processors, based on the same “Zen” x86 core architecture. In October 2017, we announced AMD Ryzen 7 2700U and AMD Ryzen 5 2500U, our first mobile processors with Radeon™ Vega graphics, previously codenamed the “Raven Ridge” mobile APUs, for premium 2-in-1s, convertibles and ultra-thin notebook computers. AMD Ryzen 7 2700U and AMD Ryzen5 2500U processors combine the “Zen” x86 core architecture with Radeon™ Vega graphics in an SoC design. We also expanded our consumer and professional graphics offerings with new graphics solutions. We introduced the Radeon™ RX 500 series in April 2017, a new line of graphics cards based on second-generation “Polaris” architecture that provides additional performance. We also announced the “Polaris” architecture-based Radeon™ Pro Duo card designed for media and entertainment, broadcast, and design and manufacturing workflows. We launched our new “Vega” GPU architecture for the high-end gaming, professional, and datacenter markets. We introduced our Radeon™ RX Vega family of GPUs for enthusiast gamers, Radeon™ Pro SSG for up to 8K video production, and Radeon™ Instinct MI25 for machine intelligence and datacenter markets.We also focused on improving our competitive position in the server and datacenter markets. In June 2017, we launched the AMD EPYC™ 7000 Series of high performance processors that have up to 32 high-performance “Zen” compute cores and are designed to support a full range of integer, floating point, memory bandwidth and I/O workloads. Customer engagement with our EPYC™ processors continued to grow during the year. In October 2017, we announced the AMD Embedded Radeon™ E9170 Series GPU. The new processor is the first “Polaris” architecture-based AMD Embedded discrete GPU available in multi-chip module (MCM) format with integrated memory for smaller, power-efficient custom designs. Our financial results improved in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as the demand for our Computing and Graphics segment products increased. Net revenue for 2017 was $5.3 billion, an increase of 25% compared to 2016. Our operating income for 2017 improved to $204 million compared to an operating loss of $372 million for 2016. Our net income for 2017 improved to $43 million compared to a net loss of $497 million in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2017 were 37$1.18 billion, down from $1.26 billion at the end of 2016. Principal amount of total debt as of December 30, 2017 was $1.70 billion, compared to $1.77 billion as of December 31, 2016.We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and realizable value. If in any period we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. In the third fiscal quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Topic 350 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. We therefore applied a different impairment analysis for 2017 than was performed in 2016 and 2015.In assessing impairment of goodwill prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-04, we first analyzed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The qualitative factors we assessed included long-term prospects of our performance, share price trends, market capitalization and company-specific events. If we concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, we needed not perform the two-step impairment test. If based on that assessment we believed it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units was less than its carrying value, a two-step goodwill impairment test would be performed. The first step of the two-step test measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of 38one or more valuation models common to our industry including income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using the market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market condition. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.In the third quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2017-04 which eliminated step two from the goodwill impairment test. In assessing impairment of goodwill, if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value during our qualitative assessment, a one-step goodwill impairment test will be performed. During the quantitative test, if it is concluded that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Based on the results of our annual qualitative analysis of goodwill in 2017, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amount and, as such, we did not need to perform the quantitative impairment test and there was no goodwill impairment.Based on the results of our annual qualitative analysis of goodwill in 2016, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amount and, as such, we did not need to perform the two-step impairment test and there was no goodwill impairment.Estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. Potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment.Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.39In December 2017,the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. We have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The accounting is expected to be complete within one year of the date of enactment.In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the Tax Reform Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. Because of the complexity of the new provisions, we are continuing to evaluate how the provisions will be accounted for under U.S. GAAP wherein companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election of either (i) account for GILTI as a component of tax expense in the period in which we are subject to the rules (the period cost method), or (ii) account for GILTI in the Company’s measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). Currently, we have not elected a method and will only do so after we complete the analysis of the GILTI provisions and our election method will depend, in part, on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in our taxable income related to GILTI and, if so, the impact that is expected.Results of OperationsWe intend this discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.We use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 included 52 weeks, 53 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. The extra week in 2016 did not have a material impact on our results of operations. References in this report to 2017, 2016 and 2015 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise.Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net, income taxes and equity loss in investee. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. We have the following two reportable segments:•the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, graphics processing units (GPUs), professional GPUs and licensing portions of our intellectual property (IP) portfolio; and•the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, development services, technology for game consoles and licensing portions of our IP portfolio.In addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. Also included in this category are employee stock-based compensation expense, the charge related to the Sixth Amendment to the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF), restructuring and other special charges, net and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We also reported the results of former businesses in the All Other category because the operating results were not material. 40The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2017, 2016 and 2015. 2017 2016 2015 (In millions)Net revenue: Computing and Graphics$3,029 $1,967 $1,805Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom2,300 2,305 2,186Total net revenue$5,329 $4,272 $3,991Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics$147 $(238) $(502)Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom154 283 215All Other(97) (417) (194)Total operating income (loss)$204 $(372) $(481)Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics net revenue of $3.0 billion in 2017 increased by 54% compared to $2.0 billion in 2016 as a result of a 47% increase in average selling price and a 2% increase in unit shipments. The increase in the average selling price was primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix as we transitioned to our new Radeon™ GPU and Ryzen™ desktop processor products. The increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to higher demand for our GPU products.Computing and Graphics net revenue of $2.0 billion in 2016 increased by 9% compared to $1.8 billion in 2015 as a result of a 9% increase in unit shipments, offset by a 2% decrease in average selling price. The increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to higher unit shipments of our GPU products, partially offset by lower unit shipments of our microprocessor products. The increase of unit shipments of our GPU products was primarily driven by demand for our Polaris architecture-based GPU products. The decrease in unit shipments of our microprocessor products was primarily due to lower unit shipments of our desktop microprocessor products due to lower demand, partially offset by higher shipments of notebook microprocessor products driven by higher demand for our 7th Generation A-Series notebook processors. The decrease in average selling price was primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling price of our desktop microprocessor and notebook GPU products due to a shift in our product mix, partially offset by an increase in average selling price of our channel GPU products primarily due to strong demand for our Polaris architecture-based GPU products.Computing and Graphics operating income was $147 million in 2017 compared to an operating loss of $238 million in 2016. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by the related increase in cost of sales and an $84 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.Computing and Graphics operating loss was $238 million in 2016 compared to an operating loss of $502 million in 2015. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above and a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of sales primarily due to higher sales in 2016 compared to 2015. In 2015, cost of sales included an inventory write-down of $52 million as a result of lower than anticipated demand for primarily older-generation APU products. Operating expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.3 billion in 2017 was flat compared to 2016. IP related revenue and sales of our AMD EPYC™ datacenter processors, which were launched in June of 2017, were mostly offset by a decrease in non-recurring engineering (NRE) revenue and lower sales of our semi-custom SoC products.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.3 billion in 2016 increased by 5% compared to net revenue of $2.2 billion in 2015. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products and NRE revenue. The increase in unit shipments was primarily driven by increased demand.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $154 million in 2017 compared to operating income of $283 million in 2016. The decline in operating results was primarily due to a $108 million increase in operating expenses driven primarily by datacenter-related operating expenses, and costs associated with the WSA for certain wafers purchased at another foundry, partially offset by IP related revenue. The decline in operating results was also due to $36 million less licensing gain recorded in 412017 related to the licensed IP to the THATIC JV compared to 2016. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $283 million in 2016 compared to operating income of $215 million in 2015. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, an $88 million licensing gain recorded in 2016 related to the Licensed IP to the THATIC JV, and a decrease in cost of sales, in part due to the absence of a technology node transition charge of $33 million recorded in 2015, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.All OtherAll Other operating loss of $97 million in 2017 was related to stock-based compensation expense. All Other operating loss of $417 million in 2016 included a charge of $340 million, which was comprised of the $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the Warrant Agreement, and stock-based compensation expense of $86 million, partially offset by restructuring reversals of $10 million.All Other operating loss of $194 million in 2015 included restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million and stock-based compensation expense of $63 million. Restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million included $76 million related to our decision to exit from the dense server systems business, $37 million related to our 2015 Restructuring Plan and $16 million related to our 2014 Restructuring Plan.Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net Income Taxes and Equity Loss in investee The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2017, 2016 and 2015: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions, except for percentages)Cost of sales$3,506 $3,274 $2,911Gross margin1,823 998 1,080Gross margin percentage34% 23% 27%Research and development1,160 1,008 947Marketing, general and administrative511 460 482Amortization of acquired intangible assets— — 3Restructuring and other special charges, net— (10) 129Licensing gain(52) (88) —Interest expense(126) (156) (160)Other income (expense), net(9) 80 (5)Provision for income taxes19 39 14Equity loss in investee$(7) $(10) $—Gross MarginGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 34% in 2017 compared to 23% in 2016. Gross margin improved in 2017 primarily due to the absence of the charge of $340 million recorded in 2016, described below, which accounted for eight gross margin percentage points. In addition, the increase in gross margin percentage for 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a favorable shift in product mix to new Radeon™ GPU and Ryzen™ desktop processor products in the Computing and Graphics segment. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 23% in 2016 compared to 27% in 2015. Gross margin in 2016 was adversely impacted by a charge of $340 million, comprised of a $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the value of the warrant of $240 million under the Warrant Agreement. The impact of the charge accounted for eight gross margin percentage points. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs, and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the inventory write-down and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately two percentage points. In the absence of these charges, the gross margin would have increased by two percentage points, primarily driven by improved product mix.42ExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $1.2 billion in 2017 increased by $152 million, or 15%, compared to $1.0 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $92 million increase in product engineering and design related costs, driven by strategic investments in datacenter and other high performance products attributable to both segments, and also due to higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.Research and development expenses of $1.0 billion in 2016 increased by $61 million, or 6%, compared to $947 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $138 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $13 million increase attributable to our All Other category, partially offset by a $90 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to a $128 million increase in product engineering and design costs. Research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category increased primarily due to a $13 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $108 million decrease in product engineering and design costs.Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $511 million in 2017 increased by $51 million, or 11%, compared to $460 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $30 million increase in sales and marketing activities attributable to both segments and also due to higher annual employee incentives driven by our improved financial performance.Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $460 million in 2016 decreased by $22 million, or 5%, compared to $482 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $40 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment primarily due to an $18 million decrease in sales and marketing activities and a $22 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $6 million increase in other general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $12 million increase attributable to our All Other category primarily due to an $11 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.Restructuring and Other Special Charges, Net2015 Restructuring PlanIn the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan) focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. The 2015 Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and included organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, we recorded a $37 million restructuring charge which consisted of $27 million for severance and benefit costs, $1 million for facilities-related costs and $9 million for intangible asset-related charges. The actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan were completed during the first quarter of 2017. The liabilities related to the 2015 Restructuring Plan recorded in Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were zero and $3 million, respectively.2014 Restructuring PlanIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan (2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014 Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of our real estate footprint with our reduced headcount. We recorded a $57 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $6 million for contract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities-related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, a non-cash charge. During 2015, we recorded a $16 million restructuring charge which consisted of $5 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $2 million for severance and related benefits and $9 million for facilities-related costs. The 2014 Restructuring Plan was completed during the third quarter of 2015.The liabilities related to the 2014 Restructuring Plan recorded in Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were zero and $4 million, respectively.Dense Server Systems Business Exit43As a part of our strategy to simplify and sharpen our investment focus, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, we recorded a charge of $76 million in “Restructuring and other special charges, net” on our consolidated statements of operations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. We concluded that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with our dense server systems business was fully impaired as we did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric technology in any of our future products nor did we have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property. In addition, the exit charge consisted of a $7 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $4 million of severance and related benefits and $3 million for contract or program termination costs. We substantially completed this exit activity during the second quarter of 2016.Interest ExpenseInterest expense of $126 million in 2017 decreased by $30 million compared to $156 million in 2016, primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates and lower debt balances.Interest expense of $156 million in 2016 decreased by $4 million compared to $160 million in 2015, primarily due to the repurchases of debt bearing higher interest rates and issuance of new debt at a lower interest rate in late 2016.Other Income (Expense), NetOther expense, net of $9 million in 2017 changed by $89 million compared to $80 million Other income, net in 2016. Other expense, net in 2017 consisted of $12 million total loss on debt redemption partially offset by a $3 million gain for final settlement related to the sale of 85% of the equity interest in the ATMP facilities. The change from 2016 to 2017 was primarily the result of the absence in 2017 of the substantial gain on sale of equity interests in ATMP JV that was partially offset by debt repurchases which was realized in 2016.Other income, net of $80 million in 2016 changed by $85 million compared to $5 million Other expense, net in 2015, primarily due to net gain on sale of equity interests in the ATMP JV of $146 million partially offset by the $68 million total loss on debt repurchases in 2016.Income TaxesIn December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act). The Tax Reform Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system which reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, shifts to a modified territorial tax regime which requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. We recorded an income tax provision of $19 million, $39 million and $14 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The income tax provision in 2017 was primarily due to $39 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $27 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions where no foreign tax credit is expected to be realizable, offset by $1 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and $19 million primarily attributable to the reversal of the valuation allowance on Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryovers due to the Tax Reform Act.The income tax provision in 2016 was primarily due to $41 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $27 million attributable to gain on the sale of 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in Suzhou and $9 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions where no foreign tax credit is expected to be realizable, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.The income tax provision in 2015 was primarily due to $16 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.As of December 26, 2015, the Italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of our subsidiaries’ activities in Italy for the years 2003 through 2013. We entered into a settlement for $11 million in taxes and penalties, which was reflected in full in the 2015 tax provision and $2 million in interest.As of December 30, 2017, substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which in management’s estimate at December 30, 2017 is not more likely than not to be achieved.44Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseWe allocated stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and restricted stock units for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions)Cost of sales$2 $2 $3Research and development57 49 36Marketing, general and administrative38 35 24Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0$97 $86 $63During 2017, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any effects relating to operating cash flows. During 2016 and 2015, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows.Stock-based compensation expense of $97 million in 2017 increased by $11 million as compared to $86 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a higher weighted average grant date fair value of unvested restricted stock units in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was also driven by fewer actual forfeitures in 2017 compared to 2016. Stock-based compensation expense of $86 million in 2016 increased by $23 million as compared to $63 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a higher weighted average grant date fair value and higher number of shares related to restricted stock units granted in 2016 compared to the restricted stock units granted in 2015, which became fully amortized in 2016. The increase was also driven by performance-based restricted stock units with market conditions granted in 2015 and 2016.GLOBALFOUNDRIESFormation and AccountingOn March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Mubadala Technology Investments LLC, or Mubadala Tech (formerly, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC) and WCH, pursuant to which we formed GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD, Mubadala Tech and GF entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement) and a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement) on March 2, 2009.On March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, we transferred to GF all of the remaining capital stock of GF that we owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated and we were no longer party to the Shareholders’ Agreement. As a result of these transactions, we no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012.GF continues to be a related party of ours because Mubadala and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, a significant stockholder of ours. WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala.Wafer Supply Agreement The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase from GF all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements, with limited exceptions. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures microprocessor and APU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and APU products to GF.The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply.45Sixth Amendment to Wafer Supply AgreementOn August 30, 2016, we entered into a sixth amendment (the Sixth Amendment) to the WSA with GF. The Sixth Amendment modified certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five-year period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. We agreed to establish with GF a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration for the 7nm technology node.The Sixth Amendment also provides us a limited waiver with rights to contract with another wafer foundry with respect to certain products in the 14nm and 7nm technology nodes and gives us greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio. In consideration for these rights, we agreed to pay GF $100 million in installments starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the third fiscal quarter of 2017. From the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 to the third fiscal quarter of 2017, we paid GF $25 million each quarter and as of December 30, 2017, we had paid GF $100 million in aggregate. Starting in 2017 and continuing through 2020, we agreed to make quarterly payments to GF based on the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry.Further, for each calendar year during the term of the Sixth Amendment, we agreed with GF to annual wafer purchase targets that increase from 2016 through 2020. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any calendar year, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. The annual targets were established based on our business and market expectations and took into account the limited waiver we received for certain products. We met our 2017 annual wafer purchase target.We agreed with GF on fixed pricing for wafers purchased during 2016 and established a framework to agree on annual wafer pricing for the years 2017 to 2020. AMD and GF had agreed on pricing for wafer purchases for 2017.Our total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing, research and development activities and other for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1.1 billion, $0.7 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. Included in the total purchases for the year ended December 30, 2017 are amounts related to the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry, as agreed to by us and GF under the Sixth Amendment. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the amount of prepayment and other receivables related to GF was $27 million and $32 million, respectively, included in Prepayment and other receivables - related parties on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the amount of payable to GF was $241 million and $255 million, respectively, included in Payables to related parties on our consolidated balance sheets.Warrant AgreementAlso on August 30, 2016, in consideration of the limited waiver and rights under the Sixth Amendment, we entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with WCH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala. Under the Warrant Agreement, WCH and its permitted assigns are entitled to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock (the Warrant Shares) at a purchase price of $5.98 per share. The warrant under the Warrant Agreement is exercisable in whole or in part until February 29, 2020. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Warrant Agreement will only be exercisable to the extent that Mubadala does not beneficially own, either directly or through any other entities directly and indirectly owned by Mubadala or its subsidiaries, an aggregate of more than 19.99% of our outstanding capital stock after any such exercise.Equity Interest Purchase Agreement - ATMP Joint VentureIn April 2016, we and certain of our subsidiaries completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in Suzhou TF-AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (formerly, AMD Technologies (China) Co., Ltd.), and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. (formerly, Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd.), to affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (formerly, Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd.) (TFME), a Chinese joint stock company, to form two joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JV). As a result of the sale, TFME’s affiliates own 85% of the equity interests in the ATMP JV while certain of our subsidiaries own the remaining 15%. We have no obligations to fund the ATMP JV.As the result of the transaction, we received approximately $342 million, including purchase price adjustments, in net cash proceeds for selling 85% of the equity interest in each of Suzhou TF-AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. These proceeds, net of certain transaction costs, were included in investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016.We recognized a net pre-tax gain on the sale of the 85% equity interest in ATMP JV of $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was recognized in Other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. The net pre-tax gain reflects the excess of the sum of net cash proceeds and fair value of our retained 15% equity interests in the ATMP JV over the sum of the net book values of our former subsidiaries and other closing costs directly attributed to the divestiture. The above gain includes $11 million in excess of fair value of our retained interest over the corresponding net book values. During 462017, we recorded a $3 million pre-tax gain for final settlement related to the sale of 85% of the equity interest in ATMP facilities in Other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations.We account for our equity interests in the ATMP JV under the equity method of accounting due to our significant influence over the ATMP JV. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the carrying value of our investment in the ATMP JV was $58 million and $59 million, respectively. Following the deconsolidation, the ATMP JV is our related party. The ATMP JV provides assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) services to us. We currently pay the ATMP JV for ATMP services on a cost-plus basis. Our total purchases from the ATMP JV during 2017 and 2016 amounted to approximately $438 million and $265 million, respectively. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the amount payable to the ATMP JV was $171 million and $128 million, respectively, included in Payables to related parties on our consolidated balance sheets.During 2017 and 2016, we recorded losses of $7 million and $10 million, respectively, in Equity loss in investee on our consolidated statements of operations, which included certain expenses incurred by us on behalf of the ATMP JV.Equity Joint VentureIn February 2016, we and Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity (JV Partner), formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). Our equity share in China JV1 and China JV2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by our contribution of certain of our patents. The JV Partner is responsible for the initial and on-going financing of the THATIC JV’s operations. We have no obligations to fund the THATIC JV.We concluded the China JV1 and China JV2 are not operating joint ventures and are variable interest entities due to their reliance on on-going financing by JV Partner. We determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of either China JV1 or China JV2, as we do not have unilateral power to direct selling and marketing, manufacturing and product development activities related to the THATIC JV's products. Accordingly, we do not consolidate either of these entities and therefore account for our investments in the THATIC JV under the equity method of accounting. The THATIC JV is a related party of ours.In February 2016, we licensed certain of our intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of approximately $293 million in license fees payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. We also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP. We also provided certain engineering and technical support to the THATIC JV in connection with the product development. In March 2017, we entered into a development and intellectual property agreement (Development and IP) with THATIC JV, and also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such agreement. In addition, from time to time, we enter into certain agreements with the THATIC JV to provide other services primarily related to research and development.We recognized income related to the Licensed IP over the period commencing upon delivery of the first Licensed IP milestone through the date of the milestone that required our continuing involvement in the product development process, which was completed at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Royalty payments will be recognized in income once earned. We classify Licensed IP income and royalty income associated with the February 2016 agreement as other operating income. During 2017, we recognized a $52 million licensing gain associated with the Licensed IP. In addition, during 2017 we recognized $36 million of Development and IP fees and other services fees of $12 million as credits to research and development expenses. During 2016, we recognized an $88 million licensing gain. No credits for the Development and IP agreement and other services was recognized as credits to research and development by us during 2016. No royalty income was recognized by us during 2017 and 2016.Our total exposure to losses through our investment in the THATIC JV is limited to our investments in the THATIC JV, which was zero as of December 30, 2017. Our share in the net losses of the THATIC JV for 2017 was not material and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of operations since we are not obligated to fund the THATIC JV's losses in excess of our investment in the THATIC JV. Our receivable from the THATIC JV for these agreements was $3 million and zero as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, included in Prepayment and other receivables - related parties on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the total assets and liabilities of the THATIC JV were not material.International SalesInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 74% in 2017 and 78% in 2016. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from domestic sales of our desktop processors, graphics processors and semi-custom SoC products.47 International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 78% in 2016 and 75% in 2015. The increase in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by higher proportion of revenue from international sales of our semi-custom SoC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars.FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityAs of December 30, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash, government money market funds and commercial paper. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2017 were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. The decrease during the year was due to net cash used in our investing and financing activities, partially offset by net cash provided by our operating activities discussed below. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 95% as of December 30, 2017, and 98% as of December 31, 2016.Our cash flows for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$68 $90 $(226)Investing activities(114) 267 147Financing activities(33) 122 59Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(79) $479 $(20)Our debt obligations of $1.40 billion, net of unamortized debt discount of $286 million, associated with the 2.125% Notes, as of December 30, 2017 decreased compared to $1.44 billion as of December 31, 2016.We believe our cash and cash equivalents balance along with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.Should we require additional funding such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business. If market conditions deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $68 million in 2017 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $90 million in 2016. The decrease in cash inflows from operating activities was primarily due to higher operating costs including higher wafer purchases, higher labor costs and payments to GF in aggregate of $50 million of a limited waiver of rights under the Sixth Amendment, partially offset by higher cash collection primarily due to higher revenue and lower interest payments resulting from debt reductions.Net cash provided by operating activities was $90 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $226 million in 2015. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to lower operating expenses including lower labor costs and lower restructuring-related payments, the receipt of $97 million associated with the licensing agreement with THATIC JV and higher sales and timing of related collections, partially offset by timing of accounts payable payments.During 2017, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any effects relating to operating cash flows for these periods.Investing Activities48Net cash used in investing activities was $114 million in 2017, which consisted primarily of a cash outflow of $113 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.Net cash provided by investing activities was $267 million in 2016, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $342 million from sale of equity interests in the ATMP JV, partially offset by a cash outflow of $77 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.Net cash provided by investing activities was $147 million in 2015, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $235 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities, partially offset by a net cash outflow of $88 million for purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment. Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $33 million in 2017, primarily due to the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $103 million of our outstanding 6.75% Notes and 7.00% Notes for $110 million in cash and $13 million for tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock, partially offset by the $70 million net proceeds from our Secured Revolving Line of Credit and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans.Net cash provided by financing activities was $122 million in 2016, primarily due to the $782 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 2.125% Notes, the $667 million net proceeds from selling 115 million shares of our common stock and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion of our outstanding 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes and 7.00% Notes for $1.1 billion in cash and repayments in aggregate of $230 million of our Secured Revolving Line of Credit.Net cash provided by financing activities was $59 million in 2015, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $100 million, of which $42 million was used to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes) during the second quarter of 2015. In addition, during 2015, we received $5 million from the exercise of employee stock options.During 2016 and 2015, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows for these periods.49Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 30, 2017, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period(In millions)Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 and thereafterSenior Notes 6.75% Notes$166 $— $166 $— $— $— $—7.50% Notes 347 — — — — 347 —7.00% Notes311 — — — — — 3112.125% Notes805 — — — — — 805Secured Revolving Line of Credit70 70 — — — — —Other long-term liabilities(1)109 51 45 8 3 — 2Aggregate interest obligation (2)459 78 72 66 66 65 112Operating leases255 40 35 31 29 28 92Purchase obligations (3)513 346 65 40 33 29 —Obligations to GF (4)2,841 1,297 764 780 — — —Total contractual obligations (5)$5,876 $1,882 $1,147 $925 $131 $469 $1,322 (1) Amounts largely represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses and IP licenses, including the payments due within the next 12 months.(2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount.(3) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire.

As of December 30, 2017, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% Notes was $311 million.See Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding our 7.00% Notes.2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026On September 14, 2016, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes. We also granted an option to the underwriters to purchase up to an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes. On September 28, 2016, this option was exercised in full and we issued an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes.Our 2.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and will mature on September 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. Interest is payable in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on March 1, 2017. Our 2.125% Notes are governed by the terms of a base indenture and a supplemental indenture (together the 2.125% Indentures) dated September 14, 2016 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2026 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon 51the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the our common stock, at our election. During the fourth quarter of 2017, none of the conversion conditions were satisfied and as a result, the 2.125% Notes are not eligible for conversion during the first calendar quarter of 2018.We may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the notes.The conversion rate is initially 125.0031 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances.If we undergo a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.As of December 30, 2017, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes was $805 million. See Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below for additional information regarding our 2.125% Notes.Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so.

As of December 31, 2016, we had repaid an aggregate of $230 million of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit and we had no borrowings outstanding. As of December 30, 2017, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had $19 million related to outstanding letters of credit and up to $92 million available for future borrowings. We report intra-period changes in revolving credit balance on a net basis in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as we intend the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. As of December 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Loan Agreement.The agreements governing our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 2.125% Notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.Operating LeasesWe lease certain of our facilities and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which our facilities are built under non-cancellable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. We lease certain office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancellable lease obligations as of December 30, 2017 were $255 million, including $217 million of future lease payments that occurred in Austin, Texas, Santa Clara, California, Markham, Canada, and Singapore. During the second quarter of 2016, we signed an amendment to the lease agreement associated with our former headquarters in Sunnyvale, California so that the lease expired in December 2017. In connection with the amendment, the lease payments were reduced for 2017. During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a 10-year operating lease to occupy 220,000 square feet of new office space in Santa Clara. The base rent obligation commenced in August 2017. As of December 30, 2017, the total estimate of future base rent over the life of the lease is approximately $103 million, included in amounts above. In addition to the base rent payments, we will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for our share of operating expenses and tax obligation. We will also incur costs for capital projects on the new office space. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional five-year periods.Purchase ObligationsOur purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties, excluding our wafer purchase commitments to GF under the WSA. As of December 30, 2017, total non-cancellable purchase obligations were $513 million.Obligations to GFAs of December 30, 2017, our minimum wafer purchase obligations for the years 2018 through 2020 are approximately $2.8 billion. We cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF beyond this amount but expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 30, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.54ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 30, 2017, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.As of December 30, 2017, all of our outstanding long term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 30, 2017, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. There were no significant sales of available-for-sale securities during 2017.The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 30, 2017: 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 and thereafter Total 2017Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages)Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts$682 $— $— $— $— $— $682 $682Weighted-average rate1.47% — — — — — 1.47% 1.47%Variable rate amounts$395 $— $— $— $— $— $395 $395Weighted-average rate1.19% — — — — — 1.19% 1.19%Total Investment Portfolio$1,077 $— $— $— $— $— $1,077 $1,077Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts$— $166 $— $— $347 $1,116 $1,629 $—Weighted-average effective interest rate—% 6.75% —% —% 7.00% 3.48% 4.67% —%Variable rate amounts$— $— $— $— $— $— $— $—Weighted-average effective interest rate—% —% —% —% —% —% —% —%Total Debt Obligations$— $166 $— $— $347 $1,116 $1,629 $—Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.In applying our strategy, from time to time we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses to the extent eligible under the accounting rules and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified 55to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings.We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

We announced the availability of our first desktop consumer and commercial Ryzen and Ryzen PRO APUs that combine our high-performance “Zen” CPU and Radeon “Vega” graphics cores into a single chip. We also introduced the first entry-level processors based on our “Zen” CPU and “Vega” GPU cores for the consumer and commercial desktop PC market with the AMD Athlon™ and AMD PRO processors. In the notebook market, multiple customers launched premium consumer and commercial PCs featuring our mobile AMD Ryzen APUs, including our first enterprise-class notebooks powered by our new AMD Ryzen PRO APUs. For the high-performance embedded markets, we introduced the AMD EPYC™ Embedded 3000 processor and AMD Ryzen Embedded V1000 processor families that bring new levels of computing and graphics performance to the thin client, digital signage, and infrastructure markets.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 29, 2018 were $1.16 billion, down from $1.18 billion at the end of 2017. Principal amount of total debt as of December 29, 2018 was $1.53 billion, compared to $1.70 billion as of December 30, 2017.We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with 36management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Revenue recognition. In accordance with the adoption of the new revenue standard effective the beginning of the first quarter of 2018, we now recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributors (sell-in), rather than upon the resale of the product by our distributors to their customers (sell-through). Accordingly, we have established provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold product held by our distributors.Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and realizable value. If in any period we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.Goodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. We first analyze qualitative factors. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.37In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. More specifically, SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. As a result, we have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017. During 2018, we finalized our computation of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the Tax Reform Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (i) account for GILTI as a component of tax expense in the period in which they are subject to the rules (the period cost method), or (ii) account for GILTI in the Company’s measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). After completing the analysis of the GILTI provisions, we elected to account for GILTI using the period cost method.Results of OperationsWe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments:the Computing and Graphics segment and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 15: Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, first quarter PC product sales were generally lower than fourth quarter sales and with respect to our semi-custom SoC products for game consoles our sales pattern usually reflects higher sales in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters.The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016. 2018 2017 2016 (In millions)Net revenue: Computing and Graphics$4,125 $2,977 $1,988Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom2,350 2,276 2,331Total net revenue$6,475 $5,253 $4,319Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics$470 $92 $(243)Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom163 132 287All Other(182) (97) (417)Total operating income (loss)$451 $127 $(373)Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics net revenue of $4.1 billion in 2018 increased by 39%, compared to $3.0 billion in 2017, primarily as a result of a 15% increase in average selling price and a 17% increase in unit shipments. The increase in average selling price and unit shipments was primarily driven by higher demand for our Ryzen™ processors. Computing and Graphics net revenue of $3.0 billion in 2017 increased by 50%, compared to $2.0 billion in 2016 as a result of a 38% increase in average selling price and a 1% increase in unit shipments. The increase in the average selling price was primarily driven by Ryzen desktop processor and Radeon graphics products sales. The increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to higher demand for our Radeon graphics products.Computing and Graphics operating income was $470 million in 2018 compared to operating income of $92 million in 2017. The improvement in operating income was primarily driven by higher demand for Ryzen and Radeon products as customers continued to adopt our new products, partially offset by a $195 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.38Computing and Graphics operating income was $92 million in 2017, compared to an operating loss of $243 million in 2016. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by the related increase in cost of sales and operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2018 increased by 3% compared to net revenue of $2.3 billion 2017. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server products, partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.28 billion in 2017 decreased by 2% compared to net revenue of $2.33 billion in 2016. IP related revenue and sales of our EPYC datacenter processors, which were launched in June of 2017, were mostly offset by a decrease in non-recurring engineering (NRE) revenue and lower sales of our semi-custom SoC products.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $163 million in 2018 compared to operating income of $132 million in 2017. The improvement in operating income was due primarily to richer server and semi-custom product mix, partially offset by a $50 million increase in operating expenses and lower IP-related revenue. In 2017, operating income also included a licensing gain of $52 million. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $132 million in 2017 compared to operating income of $287 million in 2016. The decline in operating results was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses driven primarily by datacenter-related expenses and lower licensing gain recorded in 2017 related to the licensed IP to the THATIC JV compared to 2016. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below.All OtherAll Other operating loss of $182 million in 2018 included stock-based compensation expense of $137 million and an impairment of technology licenses of $45 million.All Other operating loss of $97 million in 2017 was related to stock-based compensation expense. All Other operating loss of $417 million in 2016 included a charge of $340 million, which was comprised of the $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the Warrant Agreement with WCH, and stock-based compensation expense of $86 million, partially offset by restructuring reversals of $10 million.Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net Income Taxes and Equity Loss in Investee The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2018, 2017 and 2016: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions, except for percentages)Cost of sales$4,028 $3,466 $3,316Gross margin2,447 1,787 1,003Gross margin percentage38% 34% 23%Research and development1,434 1,196 1,008Marketing, general and administrative562 516 466Restructuring and other special charges, net— — (10)Licensing gain— (52) (88)Interest expense(121) (126) (156)Other income (expense), net— (9) 80Provision (benefit) for income taxes(9) 18 39Equity loss in investee$(2) $(7) $(10)Gross MarginGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 38% in 2018 compared to 34% in 2017. The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the ramp of new products with higher gross margin than the corporate average.39Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 34% in 2017 compared to 23% in 2016. Gross margin improved in 2017 primarily due to the absence of the charge of $340 million recorded in 2016, comprised of a $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the value of the warrant of $240 million under the Warrant Agreement, which accounted for eight gross margin percentage points. In addition, the increase in gross margin percentage for 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a favorable shift in product mix to new Radeon GPU and Ryzen desktop processor products in the Computing and Graphics segment.ExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2018 increased by $238 million, or 20%, compared to $1.2 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $168 million increase in product engineering and design related costs attributable to both segments, and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.Research and development expenses of $1.2 billion in 2017 increased by $188 million, or 19%, compared to $1.0 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $136 million increase in product engineering and design related costs attributable to both segments, and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $562 million in 2018 increased by $46 million, or 9%, compared to $516 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $41 million increase in sales and marketing activities attributable to both segments and higher annual employee incentives driven by our improved financial performance.Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $516 million in 2017 increased by $50 million, or 11%, compared to $466 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $29 million increase in sales and marketing activities attributable to both segments and higher annual employee incentives driven by our improved financial performance. Interest ExpenseInterest expense of $121 million in 2018 decreased by $5 million compared to $126 million in 2017, primarily due to lower debt balances and lower weighted average interest rates.Interest expense of $126 million in 2017 decreased by $30 million compared to $156 million in 2016, primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates and lower debt balances.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net of zero in 2018 changed by $9 million compared to $9 million Other expense, net in 2017. The change from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to $12 million higher interest income in 2018 mainly related to a withholding tax refund from a foreign jurisdiction.Other expense, net of $9 million in 2017 changed by $89 million compared to $80 million Other income, net in 2016. The change from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the absence in 2017 of the substantial gain on sale of equity interests in ATMP JV that was partially offset by loss on debt redemption in 2016.Provision (Benefit) For Income TaxesWe recorded an income tax benefit of $9 million in 2018 and an income tax provision of $18 million and $39 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.The income tax benefit in 2018 was primarily due to a $36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010, offset by $13 million of U.S. income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Act, $7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions. The income tax provision in 2017 was primarily due to withholding taxes applicable to IP-related revenue and licensing gains from foreign locations.The income tax provision in 2016 was primarily due to $41 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $27 million attributable to a gain on the sale of 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in Suzhou and $9 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions where no foreign tax credit is expected to be realizable, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.40International SalesInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 80% in 2018 and 74% in 2017. The increase in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from China and Taiwan related to sales of our products within the Computing and Graphics segment. International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 74% in 2017 and 79% in 2016. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from domestic sales of our desktop processors, graphics processors and semi-custom SoC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars.FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 29, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.16 billion compared to $1.18 billion as of December 30, 2017. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 88% as of December 29, 2018, and 95% as of December 30, 2017. Our operating, investing and financing activities for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$34 $12 $81Investing activities(170) (54) 277Financing activities28 (33) 122Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash$(108) $(75) $480Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $34 million in 2018 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $12 million in 2017. The increase in net cash provided in operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital, largely driven by higher cash collections from increased revenue, partially offset by higher labor costs and timing of accounts payable payments.Net cash provided by operating activities was $12 million in 2017 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $81 million in 2016. The decrease in cash inflows from operating activities was primarily due to higher operating costs including higher wafer purchases and higher labor costs, partially offset by higher cash collection primarily due to higher revenue and lower interest payments resulting from debt reductions.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $170 million in 2018, which primarily consisted of $163 million for purchases of property and equipment, a net cash outflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities partially offset by collection of deferred proceeds on sale of receivables.Net cash used in investing activities was $54 million in 2017, which consisted primarily of a cash outflow of $113 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by collection of deferred proceeds on sale of receivables.Net cash provided by investing activities was $277 million in 2016, which primarily consisted of a net cash inflow of $342 million from sale of equity interests in the ATMP JV, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment . 41Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities was $28 million in 2018, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $69 million from the issuance of common stock through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of $40 million of our outstanding 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes) and 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes) for $41 million in cash.Net cash used in financing activities was $33 million in 2017, which primarily consisted of the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $103 million of our outstanding 6.75% Notes and 7.00% Notes for $110 million in cash and $13 million for tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock, partially offset by the $70 million net proceeds from our Secured Revolving Line of Credit and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans.Net cash provided by financing activities was $122 million in 2016, which primarily consisted of the $782 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes), the $667 million net proceeds from selling 115 million shares of our common stock and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion of our outstanding 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes), 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes) and 7.00% Notes for $1.1 billion in cash and repayments in aggregate of $230 million of our Secured Revolving Line of Credit.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 29, 2018, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period(In millions)Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 and thereafterTerm Debt$1,458 $66 $— $— $337 $— $1,055Secured Revolving Line of Credit70 70 — — — — —Other long-term liabilities (1)170 50 42 40 35 1 2Aggregate interest obligation (2)349 63 61 61 60 35 69Operating leases322 54 48 43 40 35 102Purchase obligations (3)337 287 29 15 4 2 —Obligations to GF (4)2,435 1,200 715 520 — — —Total contractual obligations (5)$5,141 $1,790 $895 $679 $476 $73 $1,228 (1) Amounts largely represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses and IP licenses, including the payments due within the next 12 months.(2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount.(3) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (4) Subsequent to the year end, on January 28, 2019, we entered into a Seventh Amendment with GF, which among other terms modified our minimum wafer purchase obligations to GF which are reflected in the above table. These minimum purchase obligations are our contractual minimums and do not necessarily reflect our actual expected expenditures, which could be significantly different. We cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF beyond 2021 but expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.(5) Total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other liabilities related to software and technology licenses and IP licenses.42Senior Notes6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019 On February 26, 2014, we issued $600 million of our 6.75% Notes.

On September 28, 2016, this option was exercised in full and we issued an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes.Our 2.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and will mature on September 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. Interest is payable in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on March 1, 2017. Our 2.125% Notes are governed by the terms of a base indenture and a supplemental indenture (together the 2.125% Indentures) dated September 14, 2016 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2026 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the conversion conditions were satisfied and as a result, the 2.125% Notes are eligible for conversion during the first calendar quarter of 2019. We may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the notes.The conversion rate is initially 125.0031 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances.If we undergo a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.As of December 29, 2018, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes was $805 million. See Note 13 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below for additional information regarding our 2.125% Notes.Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Secured Revolving Line of CreditOn April 14, 2015, we and our subsidiary, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (together, the Borrowers), ATI Technologies ULC (collectively with the Borrowers, the Loan Parties), a group of lenders and Bank of America N.A., acting as the agent for the lenders, entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement, as amended (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a secured revolving line of credit (the Secured Revolving Line of Credit) that allows the Borrowers to borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time up to $500 million with up to $45 million available for issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings are limited up to a certain amount of eligible accounts receivable, as determined in accordance with the Agreement. The size of the commitment under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million. The commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit are available through 44March 21, 2022. The Borrowers are subject to commitment fees and letter of credit facility fees. The Loan Parties are required to comply with certain covenants under the Agreement. The Secured Revolving Line of Credit bears interest, at the option of the Borrowers, either at (a) a customary London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin (as determined in accordance with the agreement), or (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the bank’s prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50%, and (z) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.00%, plus (ii) an applicable margin. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $70 million at an interest rate of 6.00% and 4.75%. respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had repaid an aggregate of $230 million of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit and we had no borrowings outstanding. As of December 29, 2018, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had $26 million related to outstanding letters of credit and up to $175 million available for future borrowings. We report intra-period changes in revolving credit balance on a net basis in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as we intend the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. As of December 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Loan Agreement.The agreements governing our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 2.125% Notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.Operating LeasesWe lease certain of our facilities and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which our facilities are built under non-cancellable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. In addition, we lease certain office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancellable lease obligations as of December 29, 2018 were $322 million, including $259 million of future lease payments related to leases in Austin, Texas, Santa Clara, California, Markham, Canada, Singapore and Shanghai, China. During the second quarter of 2018, we entered into a 10-year operating lease to occupy approximately 270,000 square feet of office space in Shanghai, China. Base rent payments commenced in October 2018 and the total estimated base rent payments over the life of the lease are approximately $72 million. As of December 29, 2018, the total estimate of future base rent over the life of the lease is approximately $68 million. In addition to the base rent payments, we are obligated to pay certain customary amounts for our share of operating expenses and tax obligations. We will also incur costs for capital projects for the new office space. During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a 10-year operating lease to occupy 220,000 square feet of new office space in Santa Clara. The base rent obligation commenced in August 2017. As of December 29, 2018, the total estimate of future base rent over the life of the lease is approximately $94 million, included in amounts above. In addition to the base rent payments, we will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for our share of operating expenses and tax obligation. We will also incur costs for capital projects on the new office space. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional five-year periods.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 29, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.45ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 29, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.As of December 29, 2018, all of our outstanding long term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 29, 2018, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. There were no significant sales of available-for-sale securities during 2018.The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 29, 2018: 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 and thereafter Total 2018Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages)Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts$488 $— $— $— $— $— $488 $488Weighted-average rate2.45% — — — — — 2.45% Variable rate amounts$312 $— $— $— $— $— $312 $312Weighted-average rate2.29% — — — — — 2.29% Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts$78 $— $— $— $— $— $78 $78Weighted-average rate2.77% — — — — — 2.77% Total Investment Portfolio$878 $— $— $— $— $— $878 $878Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts$66 $— $— $337 $— $1,055 $1,458 $2,494Weighted-average effective interest rate6.75% —% —% 7.50% —% 3.28% 4.41% Variable rate amounts$70 $— $— $— $— $— $70 $70Weighted-average effective interest rate6.00% —% —% —% —% —% 6.00% Total Debt Obligations$136 $— $— $337 $— $1,055 $1,528 $2,564Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.In applying our strategy, from time to time we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses to the extent eligible 46under the accounting rules and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings.We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2020,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2019 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”IntroductionIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018.Overview 2019 marked a milestone in our multi-year journey with the launch of our 7 nanometer (nm) product portfolio. We executed our product roadmap and introduced a number of high-performance products in 2019. For the PC market, we introduced the 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen™ desktop processor family based on the new Zen 2 core architecture with AMD chiplet design approach. In addition to our mainstream PC product family, we introduced the next generation of the Ryzen™ Threadripper™ product line designed for the high-end desktop segment for creators and enthusiasts. We announced our second-generation AMD Ryzen™ 3000 Series notebook processors, powering ultrathin, commercial and gaming notebooks. A number of high-performance graphics products were also launched in 2019. We introduced the AMD Radeon™ VII, a premium graphics card for gamers, creators and enthusiasts. We also announced the availability of the AMD Radeon™ RX 5700-series gaming graphics card family, the AMD Radeon™ RX 5500 series that will be available in desktop PCs from major PC manufacturers as well as the Radeon™ 5500M GPU for notebook PCs. Our AMD Radeon™ Pro Vega II GPU is designed to power demanding professional applications. We also announced the AMD Radeon™ Pro W5700, a 7nm professional PC workstation graphics card that enables 3D professionals to visualize and interact with their designs in real time. For the server market, we introduced the 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ family of processors that feature up to 64 “Zen 2” cores in 7nm process technology for performance and are designed to reduce total cost of ownership (TOC) by up to 50%. Net revenue for 2019 was $6.7 billion, an increase of 4% compared to 2018 net revenue of $6.5 billion. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2019, was 43%, compared to 38% in 2018. Our operating income for 2019 improved to $631 million compared to operating income of $451 million for 2018. Our net income for 2019 improved to $341 million compared to $337 million in the prior year. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 28, 2019 were $1.5 billion, up from $1.2 billion at the end of 2018. We made significant progress towards improving our balance sheet in 2019 as we reduced our debt. Principal amount of total debt as of December 28, 2019 was $563 million, compared to $1.5 billion as of December 29, 2018.We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. 34Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Revenue recognition. We recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributors (sell-in), rather than upon the resale of the product by our distributors to their customers (sell-through). Accordingly, we have established provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold product held by our distributors.Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our actual cost or estimated net realizable value. Among other factors, management considers recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand, estimates of future selling prices, competitiveness of product offerings, market and industry conditions, customer requirements and product life cycles when determining excess, obsolescence and net realizable value in relation to the inventory on hand. If in any period we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.Goodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. We first analyze qualitative factors. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.35We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider multiple factors including past performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and future expected taxable income. When considering all available evidence, if it is determined we can more-likely-than-not realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.Results of OperationsWe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: the Computing and Graphics segment and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 15: Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2019, 2018 and 2017. 2019 2018 2017 (In millions)Net revenue: Computing and Graphics$4,709 $4,125 $2,977Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom2,022 2,350 2,276Total net revenue$6,731 $6,475 $5,253Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics$577 $470 $92Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom263 163 132All Other(209) (182) (97)Total operating income$631 $451 $127Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2019 increased by 14%, compared to $4.1 billion in 2018, primarily as a result of a 22% increase in average selling price and a 4% increase in unit shipments. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of client processors due to strong demand of our Ryzen processors. The increase in unit shipments was primarily due to higher demand for our Ryzen processors, partially offset by lower demand for our Radeon graphics products.Computing and Graphics operating income was $577 million in 2019 compared to operating income of $470 million in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher sales, partially offset by a $194 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.0 billion in 2019 decreased by 14% compared to net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2018, primarily as a result of lower semi-custom product revenue, partially offset by higher sales of our EPYC server processors.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $263 million in 2019 compared to operating income of $163 million in 2018. The increase in operating income was due primarily to higher sales of our EPYC server processor and a licensing 36gain of $60 million recognized in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by lower semi-custom product revenue and a $37 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.All OtherAll Other operating loss of $209 million in 2019 included $197 million of stock-based compensation expense and a $12 million contingent loss accrual on a legal matter. All Other operating loss of $182 million in 2018 included $137 million of stock-based compensation expense and an impairment of technology licenses of $45 million. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Expense and Income TaxesThe following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2019, 2018 and 2017: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions, except for percentages)Cost of sales$3,863 $4,028 $3,466Gross profit2,868 2,447 1,787Gross margin percentage43% 38% 34%Research and development1,547 1,434 1,196Marketing, general and administrative750 562 516Licensing gain(60) — (52)Interest expense(94) (121) (126)Other expense, net(165) — (9)Provision for (benefit from) income taxes31 (9) 18Gross MarginGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 43% in 2019 compared to 38% in 2018. The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors, which have a higher gross margin than the corporate average.ExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $1.5 billion in 2019 increased by $113 million, or 8%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in product development costs in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense.Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $750 million in 2019 increased by $188 million, or 33%, compared to $562 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense.Licensing GainDuring 2019, we recognized $60 million as licensing gain associated with the licensed IP to THATIC JV. See Note 4 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.Interest ExpenseInterest expense of $94 million in 2019 decreased by $27 million compared to $121 million in 2018, primarily due to lower debt balances.Other Expense, NetOther expense, net increased in 2019 by $165 million from net of zero in 2018. The change from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to $176 million of loss on redemption, repurchases and conversions of debt in 2019.37Provision For (Benefit From) Income TaxesWe recorded an income tax provision of $31 million in 2019 and income tax benefit of $9 million in 2018.The income tax provision in 2019 was primarily due to $22 million of withholding taxes related to cross-border transactions and $22 million of foreign income taxes in profitable locations partially offset by a $13 million benefit for a reduction of U.S. income taxes accrued in the prior year.The income tax benefit in 2018 was primarily due to a $36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010, offset by $13 million of U.S. income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Act, $7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions.As we continue to make progress in our business resulting in improved financial results, our future reassessment could possibly result in a determination that a valuation allowance is no longer required. The impact of the determination would result in the release of the valuation allowance and significant financial impact in a future reporting period with a material non-cash income tax benefit and the recording of additional deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet.International SalesInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 74% in 2019 and 80% in 2018. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 28, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion as of December 29, 2018. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 90% as of December 28, 2019, and 88% as of December 29, 2018. Our operating, investing and financing activities for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$493 $34 $12Investing activities(149) (170) (54)Financing activities43 28 (33)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash$387 $(108) $(75)Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $0.6 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with our Secured Revolving Facility entered into in June 2019 (refer to Note 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $493 million in 2019 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $34 million in 2018. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital, largely driven by higher cash collections, partially offset by timing of accounts payable payments and higher wafer purchases and payroll.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $149 million in 2019, which primarily consisted of $217 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a net cash inflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $41 million.38Net cash used in investing activities was $170 million in 2018, which primarily consisted of $163 million for purchases of property and equipment and a net cash outflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $78 million.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities was $43 million in 2019, which primarily consisted of a cash inflow of $449 million from the warrant exercised by West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) and $74 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by $473 million of cash used for debt reduction activities during the year.Net cash provided by financing activities was $28 million in 2018, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $70 million from the issuance of common stock through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $41 million of cash used for debt reduction activities in 2018.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 28, 2019, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period(In millions)Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 and thereafterTerm debt$563 $— $— $312 $— $— $251Aggregate interest obligation (1)102 30 30 21 6 6 9Other long-term liabilities (2)155 54 50 48 1 — 2Operating leases287 54 48 44 37 33 71Purchase obligations (3)2,290 1,677 592 10 4 2 5Total contractual obligations (4)$3,397 $1,815 $720 $435 $48 $41 $338 (1) Represents interest obligations, payable in cash, for our outstanding debt.

(3) Represents purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (4) Total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other liabilities related to software and technology licenses and IP licenses.The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Term Debt7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022On August 15, 2012, we issued $500 million of the 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes). The 7.50% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.In 2014, we repurchased $25 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes in open market transactions for $24 million. In 2016, we repurchased $125 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes pursuant to a partial tender offer for $135 million. In 2017, we settled $3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes in treasury stock. In 2018, we settled $10 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes in treasury stock at a weighted-average cost of $9.01 per share. During 2019, we repurchased $25 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes in cash. As of December 28, 2019, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes was $312 million. 392.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026In September 2016, we issued $805 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes). The 2.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. The interest is payable semi-annually in March and September of each year, commencing in March 2017.The 2.125% Notes mature on September 1, 2026. However, as outlined in the indenture governing the 2.125% Notes, holders of the 2.125% Notes may convert them at their option during certain time periods and upon the occurrence of one of the following circumstances:(1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock); (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election. The event described in (1) above was met during the fourth calendar quarter of 2019 and, as a result, the 2.125% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder from January 1, 2020 and remain convertible until March 31, 2020.During 2019, we converted $554 million principal amount of the 2.125% Notes through the issuance of approximately 69 million shares of our common stock at the conversion price of $8.00 per share and an aggregate cash payment of $56 million. As of December 28, 2019, we had $251 million principal of 2.125% Notes outstanding. See Note 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below for additional information regarding our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes.Operating LeasesWe lease certain of our facilities under non-cancellable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. In addition, we lease certain office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancellable lease obligations as of December 28, 2019 were $287 million, including future lease payments related to leases in Santa Clara, California; Austin, Texas; Markham, Canada and Shanghai, China.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 28, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.40ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 28, 2019, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.As of December 28, 2019, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 28, 2019, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. The following table presents certain information for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 28, 2019: 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 and thereafter Total (1) 2019Fair Value (2) (In millions, except for percentages)Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Variable rate amounts$1,425 $— $— $— $— $— $1,425 $1,425 Weighted-average rate1.83% —% —% —% —% —% 1.83% Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts$37 $— $— $— $— $— $37 $37 Weighted-average rate2.13% —% —% —% —% —% 2.13% Total Investment Portfolio$1,462 $— $— $— $— $— $1,462 $1,462Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $— $— $312 $— $— $251 $563 $1,823 Weighted-average effective interest rate—% —% 7.50% —% —% 2.125% 5.10% Total Debt Obligations$— $— $312 $— $— $251 $563 $1,823(1) The dollar amounts represent the cost basis of our investment portfolio and the remaining principal of our debt obligations. (2) Our 2.125% Notes, included in debt obligations above, were convertible at the option of the holder as of December 28, 2019. The estimated fair value of the 2.125% Notes takes into account the value of our stock price of $46.18 as of December 28, 2019 and the initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.In applying our strategy, from time to time we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses to the extent eligible under the accounting rules and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. To the extent such hedges are effective, the gain or loss on these contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and 41reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2022,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2021 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”IntroductionIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020.OverviewOur leadership portfolio of high-performance products, robust customer demand, and consistent execution helped drive strong financial results in 2021. Net revenue for 2021 was $16.4 billion, an increase of 68% compared to 2020 net revenue of $9.8 billion. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2021, was 48%, compared to 45% in 2020. Our operating income for 2021 improved to $3.6 billion compared to operating income of $1.4 billion for 2020. Our net income for 2021 improved to $3.2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the prior year. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 25, 2021 were $3.6 billion, compared to $2.3 billion at the end of 2020. The aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 25, 2021 was $313 million, compared to $338 million as of December 26, 2020.We introduced a number of high-performance products in 2021. We expanded the AMD Ryzen mobile processor family with the launch of the AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Mobile Processors with “Zen 3” core architecture designed for gamers, creators and professionals. We also announced the AMD Ryzen PRO 5000 Series Mobile Processors powered with our “Zen 3” core architecture for business laptops. AMD Ryzen PRO Series Mobile Processors are built to provide powerful computing experiences with security features for demanding business environments like remote working.We also launched a number of graphics products during 2021, including the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics card built on 7 nm process technology and AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture to deliver performance and power efficiency, as well as the AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT graphics card, designed to deliver high-frame rate, high-fidelity and highly responsive 1080p gaming experience. For mobile graphics, we introduced the AMD Radeon RX 6000M Series Mobile Graphics designed for high-performance gaming laptops and we announced the AMD Advantage™ Design Framework to deliver best-in-class gaming experiences. AMD Advantage systems combine AMD Radeon RX 6000M Series Mobile Graphics, AMD Radeon Software and AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Mobile Processors with AMD smart technologies. We also introduced the AMD Instinct MI200 series accelerators based on the 2nd Gen AMD CDNA architecture, optimized for HPC and AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) workloads. The MI200 series includes the MI250 Open Accelerator Module (OAM) form factor for purpose-built HPC/AI platforms and the MI210 PCIe form factor for mainstream server platforms. We also introduced our AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution software for game developers to help deliver a high-quality, high-resolution gaming experience. For professional graphics, we announced our AMD Radeon PRO W6000 series workstation graphics for professional users who have ultra-high resolution media projects, complex design and engineering simulations and advanced image and video editing applications. We also introduced the AMD Radeon PRO W6000X series graphics for the Mac Pro, designed to power a wide variety of demanding professional applications and workloads. For the server business, we introduced the next generation of AMD EPYC processors with the AMD EPYC 7003 Series CPUs for high-performance computing, cloud and enterprise customers. The EPYC 7003 series processors have up to 64 Zen 3 cores per processor and per-core cache memory and also include security features through AMD Infinity Guard to help drive faster times to results and improve business outcomes. Although the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2021. We are taking safety measures to protect our employees who are in 39the office and support those employees who work from home. We are also monitoring our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. COVID-19 also continues to impact the global supply chain, causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products. Despite these challenges, we took action to maintain a stable supply of materials to meet our production requirements and delivered incremental supply throughout the year. We also experienced strong customer demand in 2021 and made strategic investments through long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements in our supply chain to secure additional capacity to support future revenue growth. For example, we amended our Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) in May 2021 (the A&R Seventh Amendment) and in December 2021 (the Amendment) to modify certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafer purchases at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes from December 23, 2021 and continuing through December 31, 2025. Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and we have corresponding annual wafer targets. We also agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and we are obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment does not affect any of the prior exclusivity commitments that were removed under the A&R Seventh Amendment. We have full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node.Due to our strong financial results and growing cash flow generation, in May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (Repurchase Program) to purchase up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market. During the twelve months ended December 25, 2021, we repurchased 16.7 million shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program, for a total cash outlay of $1.8 billion. As of December 25, 2021, $2.2 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.As part of our strategy to establish AMD as the industry’s high performance computing leader, we announced in October 2020 that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. in an all-stock transaction. The completion of the transaction remains subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approval, and is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Revenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our OEM customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.We base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both.40Our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.Our estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.We offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.We also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable.Overall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.Inventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.Goodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.We first analyze qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. 41A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.We regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. Through the end of 2021, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. Results of OperationsWe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom.Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 14 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2021 and 2020:December 25, 2021December 26, 2020 (In millions)Net revenue:Computing and Graphics$9,332 $6,432 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom7,102 3,331 Total net revenue$16,434 $9,763 Operating income (loss):Computing and Graphics$2,090 $1,266 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom1,979 391 All Other(421)(288)Total operating income$3,648 $1,369 42Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics net revenue of $9.3 billion in 2021 increased by 45%, compared to $6.4 billion in 2020, primarily as a result of a 57% increase in average selling price, partially offset by an 8% decrease in unit shipments. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of Ryzen, Radeon and AMD Instinct products. The lower unit shipments were primarily driven by a strategic focus on premium and higher end products in a tight supply environment.Computing and Graphics operating income was $2.1 billion in 2021 compared to $1.3 billion in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and improved margin in the segment which more than offset higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $7.1 billion in 2021 increased by 113% compared to net revenue of $3.3 billion in 2020, primarily driven by higher sales of our semi-custom products and EPYC server processors. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $2.0 billion in 2021 compared to $391 million in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the higher revenue and improved margin in the segment which more than offset higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.All OtherAll Other operating loss of $421 million in 2021 included stock-based compensation expense of $379 million and acquisition-related costs of $42 million.All Other operating loss of $288 million in 2020 included stock-based compensation expense of $274 million and acquisition-related costs of $14 million.Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense) and Income TaxesThe following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2021 and 2020:December 25, 2021December 26, 2020 (In millions, except for percentages)Net revenue$16,434 $9,763 Cost of sales8,505 5,416 Gross profit7,929 4,347 Gross margin48 %45 %Research and development2,845 1,983 Marketing, general and administrative1,448 995 Licensing gain(12)— Interest expense(34)(47)Other income (expense), net55 (47)Income tax provision (benefit)513 (1,210)Gross MarginGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 48% in 2021 compared to 45% in 2020. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a richer mix of EPYC, Radeon and Ryzen processor sales.ExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $2.8 billion in 2021 increased by $862 million, or 43%, compared to $2.0 billion in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in product development costs due to an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.43Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion in 2021 increased by $453 million, or 46%, compared to $995 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance. Licensing GainDuring 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint ventures with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd., a third-party Chinese entity. We did not recognize a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020. Interest ExpenseInterest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.Other Income (Expense), netOther income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020.Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)We recorded an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers’ compensation.The income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits.Through the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.International SalesInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion as of December 26, 2020. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 91% as of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. 44Our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for 2021 and 2020 were as follows:December 25, 2021December 26, 2020 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$3,521 $1,071 Investing activities(686)(952)Financing activities(1,895)6 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash$940 $125 Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $313 million and $338 million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively.We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.Operating ActivitiesOur working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations are primarily cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily due to our higher net income of $3.2 billion in 2021, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $1.1 billion and net cash outflows of $774 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $640 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.6 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, a $556 million increase in inventories driven by our continued increase in product build in support of customer demand, and a $920 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2021, offset by an $801 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $526 million increase in accrued liabilities and other, both of which were driven mainly by higher marketing accruals, and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to our net income of $2.5 billion, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $488 million and net cash outflows of $931 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $219 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.1 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher collections due to better revenue linearity in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, a $417 million increase in inventories driven by an increase in product build in support of customer demand, a $231 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to an increase in vendor credits, a $513 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, offset by a $574 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven by higher marketing accruals and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $686 million in 2021, which primarily consisted of higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.1 billion and $301 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $1.7 billion.Net cash used in investing activities was $952 million in 2020, which primarily consisted of $850 million for purchases of short-term investments and $294 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $192 million for maturities of short-term investments.45Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion in 2021, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $1.8 billion under the $4 billion stock repurchase program and higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $237 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $104 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $6 million in 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $85 million, partially offset by $78 million of common stock repurchased to cover employee withholding taxes on vesting of employee equity grants. We borrowed $200 million of short-term debt during the second quarter of 2020 and paid off the balance during the third quarter of 2020.Contractual ObligationsFor a description of our contractual obligations such as debt, leases, purchase and other contractual obligations, see Part II, Item 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 - Debt and Revolving Credit Facility and Note 16 - Commitments and Guarantees. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 25, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.46ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 25, 2021, our investment portfolio consisted of time deposits and commercial paper. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.As of December 25, 2021, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 25, 2021, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2023,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”IntroductionIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.Overview2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a significant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022, we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to provide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers. Our 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022, was 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.We took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the 4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured obligations. 40Table of ContentsWe also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a new commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.We continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and technologies during 2022. For Data Center, we launched our 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ processors with next-generation architecture, technology and features, and designed to deliver optimizations across market segments and applications, while helping businesses free data center resources to create additional workload processing and accelerate output. We also unveiled our 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors with AMD 3D V-Cache technology for leadership performance in technical computing workloads. We introduced the 7 nm Versal™ ACAP VCK5000 development card designed to offer leadership AI inference performance. We announced the availability of the AMD Instinct™ ecosystem, the new AMD Instinct MI210 accelerator and ROCm™ 5 software. Together the AMD Instinct and ROCm ecosystem offers exascale-class technology to a broad base of high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) customers, designed to address the demand for compute-accelerated data center workloads and reduce the time to insights and discoveries.In the Embedded segment, we introduced the AMD Ryzen™ Embedded R2000 Series, second-generation mid-range system-on-chip processors optimized for a wide range of industrial and robotics systems, machine vision, IoT (Internet of Things) and thin-client equipment. We also introduced the Kria™ KR260 Robotics Starter Kit, the latest addition to the Kria portfolio. The kit enables rapid development of hardware-accelerated applications for robotics, machine vision and industrial communication and control.For the Client segment, we introduced the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors powered by the new “Zen 4” architecture for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. Along with the introduction of the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors, we also unveiled the new Socket AM5 platform featuring four new chipsets. These new desktop processors are designed for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. We introduced AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile processors with up to 16 “Zen 4” architecture cores. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen 6000 Series Mobile processors, built on “Zen 3+” architecture and includes AMD RDNA™ 2 architecture based on integrated graphics. We launched the AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series processors bringing “Zen 3” architecture to premium Chrome OS devices for work and collaboration. The processors offer up to eight high performance x86 cores. For workstations, we introduced the new AMD Ryzen Threadripper™ PRO 5000 WX-Series workstation processors designed for professionals to run demanding workstation applications. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen PRO 7030 Series Mobile processors built on “Zen 3” core architecture. In the Gaming segment, we unveiled the AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon RX 7900 XT gaming graphics cards that are built on next-generation high performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNA™ 3 architecture. We announced new graphics cards to the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series product line: the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT, the AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT and the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT. These new graphics cards are built on AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture and GDDR6 memory at up to 18Gbps. We launched the new AMD Radeon PRO GPUs including the introduction of the AMD Radeon PRO W6400 graphics card built on AMD RDNA 2 architecture.Although the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2022. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. 41Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Revenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.We base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both.Our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.Our estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.We offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.We also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable.Overall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.42Table of ContentsInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.Business Combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates.Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Goodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center, Gaming and Embedded. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the fair value of our reporting units. The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our reporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an appropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. 43Table of ContentsThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates (including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and inflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive environment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors that otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.We regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. Through the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. 44Table of ContentsResults of OperationsDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, we changed our reporting segments to align our financial reporting with how we manage our business in strategic end markets. This is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses our financial performance and allocates resources. As a result, we report our financial performance based on the following four reportable segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2022 and 2021:Year EndedDecember 31,2022December 25,2021(In millions)Net revenue:Data Center$6,043 $3,694 Client6,201 6,887 Gaming6,805 5,607 Embedded4,552 246 Total net revenue$23,601 $16,434 Operating income (loss):Data Center$1,848 $991 Client1,190 2,088 Gaming953 934 Embedded2,252 44 All Other(4,979)(409)Total operating income (loss)$1,264 $3,648 Data CenterData Center net revenue of $6 billion in 2022 increased by 64%, compared to net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of our EPYC server processors.Data Center operating income was $1.8 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $991 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.ClientClient net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2022 decreased by 10%, compared to net revenue of $6.9 billion in 2021, primarily driven by a 24% decrease in unit shipment, partially offset by a 19% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was due to challenging PC market conditions and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain experienced during the second half of 2022. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales.Client operating income was $1.2 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $2.1 billion in 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. 45Table of ContentsGamingGaming net revenue of $6.8 billion in 2022 increased by 21%, compared to net revenue of $5.6 billion in 2021. The increase in net revenue was driven by higher semi-custom product sales due to higher demand for gaming console SoCs, partially offset by lower gaming graphics sales due to a decrease in unit shipments driven by soft consumer demand given weakened macroeconomic conditions experienced in the second half of 2022.Gaming operating income was $953 million in 2022, compared to operating income of $934 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.EmbeddedEmbedded net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2022 increased significantly, compared to net revenue of $246 million in 2021. The significant increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue as a result of the acquisition of Xilinx in February 2022. Embedded operating income was $2.3 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $44 million in 2021. The significant increase in operating income was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue.All OtherAll Other operating loss of $5.0 billion in 2022 primarily consisted of $3.5 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $1.1 billion of stock-based compensation expense, and $452 million of acquisition-related costs, which primarily include transaction costs, amortization of Xilinx inventory fair value step-up adjustment, and depreciation related to the Xilinx fixed assets fair value step-up adjustment, certain compensation charges related to the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, and licensing gain. All Other operating loss of $409 million in 2021 primarily consisted of $379 million of stock-based compensation expense and $42 million of acquisition-related costs.Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense) and Income TaxesThe following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2022 and 2021:December 31, 2022December 25, 2021 (In millions, except for percentages)Net revenue$23,601 $16,434 Cost of sales11,550 8,505 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles1,448 — Gross profit10,603 7,929 Gross margin45 %48 %Research and development5,005 2,845 Marketing, general and administrative2,336 1,448 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles2,100 — Licensing gain(102)(12)Interest expense(88)(34)Other income, net8 55 Income tax provision (benefit)(122)513 Gross MarginGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 45% in 2022 compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.46Table of ContentsExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $5.0 billion in 2022 increased by $2.2 billion, or 76%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by strategic investments across all of our segments, including an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth. Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $2.3 billion in 2022 increased by $888 million, or 61%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth, go-to-market activities, and acquisition-related costs.Amortization of Acquisition-Related IntangiblesIn 2022, cost of sales and operating expense included $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of amortization expense from intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando.Licensing GainDuring 2022, we recognized $102 million of licensing gain from milestone achievement and royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint ventures with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd., a third-party Chinese entity. We recognized a licensing gain from royalty income of $12 million for the year ended December 25, 2021. Interest ExpenseInterest expense of $88 million in 2022 increased by $54 million compared to $34 million in 2021, primarily due to interest expense from the 2.95% Senior Notes due 2024 and the 2.375% Senior Notes due 2030 (together, the Assumed Xilinx Notes) and the 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued in 2022.Other Income (Expense), netOther income (expense), net is primarily comprised of interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.Other income, net was $8 million in 2022 compared to $55 million of Other income, net in 2021. The change was primarily due to a $62 million decrease in the fair value of equity investments in 2022 compared to an increase in fair value of $56 million from equity investments in 2021, partially offset by $65 million of interest income driven mainly by rising interest rates in 2022 compared to losses from conversion of our convertible debt of $7 million in 2021.Income Tax Provision (Benefit)We recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of (10%) and 14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit and $241 million of research and development tax credits.Through the end of fiscal year 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.International SalesInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 66% in 2022 and 72% in 2021. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.47Table of ContentsFINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion compared to $3.6 billion as of December 25, 2021. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily driven by the $2.4 billion of cash and $1.6 billion of short-term investments acquired from the Xilinx acquisition, $1.0 billion from the debt issuance of our 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes, and cash flows from operations, partially offset by stock repurchases and cash paid for the acquisition of Pensando. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 73% as of December 31, 2022, and 91% as of December 25, 2021.Our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for 2022 and 2021 were as follows:December 31, 2022December 25, 2021 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$3,565 $3,521 Investing activities1,999 (686)Financing activities(3,264)(1,895)Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$2,300 $940 Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, which consisted primarily of $1.5 billion of the Xilinx Notes assumed as part of the Xilinx acquisition and $1.0 billion of 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued during the year, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021, respectively. We repaid $312 million of our 7.50% Senior Notes that matured in August 2022. On April 29, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and other banks identified therein as lenders. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. On November 3, 2022, we established a new commercial paper program where we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.As of December 31, 2022, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $8.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion are in fiscal year 2023. On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions.We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.Operating ActivitiesOur working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.48Table of ContentsNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to our net income of $1.3 billion in 2022, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $4.1 billion and net cash outflows of $1.8 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $1.4 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by build of advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products, a $1.1 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and a $1.2 billion increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2022, offset by an $931 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $546 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven mainly by higher customer-related accruals.Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily due to our higher net income of $3.2 billion in 2021, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $1.1 billion and net cash outflows of $774 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $640 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.6 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, a $556 million increase in inventories driven by our continued increase in product build in support of customer demand, and a $920 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2021, offset by an $801 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $526 million increase in accrued liabilities and other, both of which were driven mainly by higher marketing accruals, and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance.Investing ActivitiesNet cash provided by investing activities was $2 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $4.3 billion and cash acquired as part of the acquisition of Xilinx of $2.4 billion, partially offset by higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.7 billion, cash used in the acquisition of Pensando of $1.5 billion and $450 million for purchases of property and equipment.Net cash used in investing activities was $686 million in 2021, which primarily consisted of higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.1 billion and $301 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $1.7 billion.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $3.7 billion under the Repurchase Program, higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $406 million and repayment of debt of $312 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt of $991 million and higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $167 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion in 2021, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $1.8 billion under the Repurchase Program and higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $237 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $104 million. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.49Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments, time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at December 31, 2022 would have affected the fair value of our cash equivalent and investment portfolio by approximately $2.9 million. As of December 31, 2022, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2002, which are included in this annual report. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our investments, allowance for doubtful accounts, revenues, inventories, asset impairments, restructuring charges, income taxes, commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates or the results of our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies relate to those policies that are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We hold minority interests in companies having operations or possessing technology primarily in areas within our strategic focus, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile stock prices. We also make investments in marketable equity and debt securities. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. In determining if a decline in market value below cost for a publicly traded security or debt instrument is other-than-temporary, we evaluate the relevant market conditions, offering prices, trends of earnings, price multiples and other key measures providing an indication of the instrument’s fair value. For private equity investments, we evaluate the financial condition of the investee, market conditions, trends of earnings and other key factors that provide indicators of the fair value of the investment. When a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to interest income and other, net in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional other-than-temporary losses in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other accounts receivable due from customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the current business environment and our historical collection and write-off experience. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened, additional allowances may be required in the future, resulting in additional charges to our operating results. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances and other known factors. Actual returns and allowances could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. 15 Table of Contents These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory, and are also used for near-term factory production planning. Inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand of generally six months or less, are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence. Remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change. Restructuring Charges. We record and account for our restructuring activities following formally approved plans that identify the actions and timeline over which the restructuring activities will occur. Restructuring charges include estimates pertaining to employee severance and fringe benefit costs, facility exit costs, subleasing assumptions and facility and equipment decommissioning costs resulting from exiting certain facilities. Inherent in these estimates are judgments about employee relation matters, whether employees might leave earlier than expected, complexities associated with abandoning and decommissioning facilities, the amount of sublease income we will receive, if any, and the time period necessary to sublease vacant facilities. We review remaining restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis and adjust these accruals when changes in facts and circumstances suggest actual amounts will differ from our estimates. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual cost may be different than our original or revised estimates. Deferred Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider past performance, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In fiscal 2002, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets at this time. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed, resulting in a benefit to our earnings. Commitments and Contingencies. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, which arise in the normal course of business. We are also a party to environmental matters, including local, regional, state and federal governed cleanup activities at or near locations where we currently or have in the past conducted our business. We are also a guarantor of various third-party obligations and commitments. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these contingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances, such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations In 2002, we operated in two reportable segments: the Core Products segment, which reflects the aggregation of the PC processor, memory products and Other IC products operating segments, and the Foundry Services segment. Our Core Products segment includes our PC processor products, Memory products and Other IC products. PC processor products include our seventh-generation microprocessors, the AMD Athlon and AMD Duron microprocessors. Memory products include Flash memory devices and Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM) devices. Other IC products include platform products, which primarily consist of chipsets, embedded processors, networking products and personal connectivity solutions products. Our Foundry Services segment consists of fees from Legerity, Inc. and Vantis Corporation. In 2000, our Voice Communications segment consisted of our voice communications products subsidiary, Legerity. The following is a summary of net sales by segment for 2002, 2001 and 2000. 2002 2001 2000 (Millions) Core Products segment: PC Processors $ 1,746 $ 2,419 $ 2,337 Memory Products 741 1,133 1,567 Other IC Products 176 242 457 2,663 3,794 4,361 Foundry Services segment 34 98 143 Voice Communications segment — — 140 Total $ 2,697 $ 3,892 $ 4,644 Net Sales Comparison for Years Ended December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001 Total net sales of $2,697 million decreased by 31 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. PC processors net sales of $1,746 million decreased by 28 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in both unit sales and average selling prices, reflecting industry-wide weakness in PC sales. The decrease in unit sales also reflected the execution of our plan to align AMD PC Processor inventory in the supply chain with forecasted customer demand, reflecting our decision to limit shipments and accept receipt of product returns from certain customers. We expect PC processor sales in the first quarter of 2003 to increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2002 based on sales of higher performance and higher priced products. Increasing PC processor sales levels in 2003 depends on our ability to maintain or increase average selling prices for our microprocessors, growth in unit shipments of our PC processors, our ability to introduce in a timely manner and market our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 processors and increasing market acceptance of the newest versions of the AMD Athlon processors. Memory products net sales of $741 million decreased by 35 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices reflecting continued weakness in the telecommunications and networking equipment industries. We expect memory products net sales in the first quarter of 2003 to remain flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. Increasing memory products sales levels in 2003 depends on the degree of recovery of the telecommunications and networking equipment industries, continued growth in the mobile phone market, especially in high end mobile phones which require larger amounts of Flash memory, further penetration of the mobile phone market, and increased market acceptance of our MirrorBit Flash memory products. Other IC products net sales of $176 million decreased by 27 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease was due to decreased net sales of platform products, embedded processors and networking products as a result of the sustained market declines in the communications and networking equipment industries. We expect 17 Table of Contents Other IC revenues in the first quarter of 2003 to continue to decline due to our decision to discontinue manufacturing certain of our embedded processor and networking products. Foundry Services segment service fees of $34 million decreased by 65 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. We expect that foundry services segment service fees will continue to decline in the first quarter of 2003 due to the termination of our foundry service arrangement with Legerity in the third quarter of 2002, and the termination of the foundry service arrangement with Vantis, which represented 18 percent of the total Foundry Services revenue in 2002, in the third quarter of 2003. Net Sales Comparison for Years Ended December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 Total net sales decreased by $752 million in 2001, or 16 percent, to $3,892 million from $4,644 million in 2000. PC processors net sales of $2,419 million increased by four percent in 2001 compared to 2000. This increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our AMD Athlon and AMD Duron microprocessors, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. Memory products net sales of $1,133 million decreased by 28 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease was primarily due to continuing weakness in the communications and networking equipment industries and excess inventories held by major customers. Other IC products net sales of $242 million decreased by 47 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease was due to decreased net sales of platform products, embedded processors and networking products as a result of the sustained market declines in the communications and networking equipment industries. Foundry Services segment service fees of $98 million decreased by 31 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in demand for wafer fabrication services from Vantis, partially offset by an increase in overall service fees from Legerity. There were no sales from Voice Communications segment in 2001. Voice Communications products contributed $140 million to our 2000 net sales, prior to our sale of Legerity. Comparison of Expenses, Gross Margin Percentage, Interest and Other Income, Net and Interest Expense The following is a summary of expenses, gross margin percentage, and interest and other income, net and interest expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions except for gross margin percentage) Cost of sales $ 2,106 $ 2,590 $ 2,515 Gross margin percentage 22 % 33 % 46 % Research and development $ 816 $ 651 $ 642 Marketing, general and administrative 670 620 599 Restructuring and other special charges 331 89 — Gain on sale of Legerity — — 337 Interest and other income, net 32 26 86 Interest expense 71 61 60 We operate in an industry characterized by intense competition, rapid product development cycles and high fixed costs due to capital-intensive manufacturing processes, particularly the costs to build and maintain state-of-the-art production facilities required for PC processors and memory devices. As a result, our gross margin 18 Table of Contents percentage is significantly affected by new product production costs, product demand and our ability to sell PC processors and memory devices that we manufacture at sustainable average selling prices. Gross margin percentage decreased to 22 percent in 2002 compared to 33 percent in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of both PC processors and Flash memory devices as a result of lower unit demand and average selling prices, partially offset by cost savings realized from the closure of certain facilities pursuant to the 2001 restructuring plan (discussed below) and the reallocation of certain manufacturing resources to research and development activities for new microprocessor products. Gross margin percentage decreased to 33 percent in 2001 compared to 46 percent in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of all our products caused by lower unit sales and average selling prices for Flash memory devices, networking products and embedded processors and lower average selling prices for PC processors. Research and development expenses of $816 million in 2002 increased 25 percent compared to 2001. This increase was primarily due to the reallocation of manufacturing resources, previously included in costs of goods sold, to research and development activities for new microprocessors. In addition, research and development expenses in 2002 included a $42 million charge for amounts paid to a third party in exchange for product development services provided in connection with a discrete PC processor research and development project in the fourth quarter of 2002. Research and development expenses and cost of sales in 2002 included the recognition of $21.8 and $37.5 million of deferred credits on foreign capital grants, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that were received from the State of Saxony for Fab 30. In 2001, these credits totaled $26.4 and $35.5 million. In 2000, these credits totaled $19.8 and $34.3 million. Research and development expenses of $651 million in 2001 increased slightly compared to 2000. This slight increase was due to increased costs related to research and development activities for PC processors. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $670 million in 2002 increased eight percent compared to 2001 primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses associated with the launch of our “AMD me” branding campaign. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $620 million in 2001 increased four percent compared to 2000 primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses associated with our core products and the AMD Athlon XP processor launch, offset by the absence of Legerity expenses during 2001 as a result of its sale in 2000. In December 2002, we finalized a restructuring plan (the 2002 Plan) to align our cost structure to current industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory. The 2002 Plan will result in the reduction of approximately 2,000 positions or 15 percent of our employees, affecting all levels of our workforce in almost every organization. As a result of our agreement with IBM, we are ramping down silicon processing associated with logic research and development in our SDC and will eliminate most of those related resources, including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the SDC. The 2002 Plan will also result in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We are vacating, and attempting to sublease, certain facilities currently occupied under long-term operating leases. We have also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs. Pursuant to the 2002 Plan, we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of $330.6 million, consisting primarily of $68.8 million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs, an asset impairment 19 Table of Contents charge of $32.5 million relating to a license associated with discontinued logic process development activities that has no future use, asset impairment charges of $30.6 million resulting from the abandonment of equipment previously used in logic process development and manufacturing activities, anticipated exit costs of $138.9 million primarily to vacate and consolidate our facilities and $55.5 million resulting from the abandonment of partially completed ERP software and other information technology implementation activities. We began activities pursuant to the 2002 Plan during the fourth quarter of 2002, and expect to substantially complete the activities associated with the 2002 Plan by the end of June 2003. As of December 29, 2002, 929 employees were terminated pursuant to the 2002 Plan resulting in cash payments of $14 million in severance and employee benefit costs. The following table summarizes activities under the 2002 Plan through December 29, 2002: Severance and employee benefits Asset impairment Exit costs Other restructuring charges Total (Thousands) 2002 provision $ 68,770 $ 118,590 $ 138,900 $ 4,315 $ 330,575 Q4 2002 non-cash charges — (118,590 ) — — (118,590 ) Q4 2002 cash charges (14,350 ) — (795 ) — (15,145 ) Accruals at December 29, 2002 $ 54,420 $ — $ 138,105 $ 4,315 $ 196,840 As a result of the 2002 Plan, we expect to realize overall cost reductions of $350 million in 2003. In 2001, we announced a restructuring plan (the 2001 Plan) due to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry, and a resulting decline in revenues. In connection with the plan, we closed Fabs 14 and 15 in Austin, Texas. These facilities supported certain of our older products and our Foundry Service operations, which have been discontinued as part of the plan. We also reorganized related manufacturing facilities and reduced activities primarily in Penang, Malaysia along with associated administrative support. Pursuant to the 2001 Plan, we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of $89.3 million, consisting of $34.1 million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs, $13.0 million and $3.2 million of anticipated exit costs to close facilities in Austin and Asia, mostly in Penang, and $28.7 million and $10.3 million of non-cash asset impairment charges in Austin and Asia, primarily Penang. The asset impairment charges related primarily to buildings and production equipment and have been incurred as a result of our decision to implement the plan. We substantially completed execution of the 2001 Plan by the end of 2002. As of December 29, 2002, 2,209 employees had been terminated pursuant to the 2001 Plan resulting in cash payments of approximately $35.8 million for severance and employee benefit costs, of which $1.7 million was included in current year results of operations. 720 of these positions were associated with closing Fabs 14 and 15. The balance of the reductions resulted from reorganizing activities, primarily in Penang, Malaysia, along with associated administrative support. In addition, the planned facilities closures had been completed as of December 29, 2002 and related decommissioning costs will be incurred over the next six months. 20 Table of Contents The following table summarizes activity under the 2001 Plan through December 29, 2002: Severance and employee benefits Facility and equipment impairment Facility and equipment decommission costs Other facilities exit costs Total (Thousands) 2001 provision $ 34,105 $ 39,000 $ 15,500 $ 700 $ 89,305 Cash charges (7,483 ) — — (54 ) (7,537 ) Non-cash charges — (39,000 ) — — (39,000 ) Accrual at December 30, 2001 $ 26,622 $ — $ 15,500 $ 646 $ 42,768 Cash Charges (26,622 ) — (445 ) — (27,067 ) Accrual at December 29, 2002 $ — $ — $ 15,055 $ 646 $ 15,701 As a result of the 2001 Plan, we expect to realize overall cost reductions of $129 million on an annualized basis. The actions taken to date resulted in actual savings of $83 million in 2002. We sold 90 percent of Legerity to Francisco Partners, L.P. for approximately $375 million in cash, effective July 31, 2000. Prior to the sale, Legerity was a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD, selling voice communications products. Our pre-tax gain on the sale of Legerity was $337 million. The gain was computed based on the excess of the consideration received for Legerity’s net assets as of July 31, 2000, less direct expenses related to the sale. The applicable tax rate on the gain was 37 percent, resulting in an after-tax gain of $212 million. Interest and other income, net, increased $6 million or 23 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to $4.7 million in charges for other than temporary declines in our equity investments as compared to $27 million in charges in 2001 and a decrease of $20 million in interest income as a result of lower interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower average cash balances. Interest expense increased 16 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to interest expense incurred on our $500 million 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022, issued at the end of January 2002, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with conversion of Fab 25 to a Flash memory facility and facilitization activities at Fab 30 and a decrease of interest expenses incurred on our Dresden term loans due to a partial repayment of the outstanding balance in 2002. Interest and other income, net, decreased $60 million or 70 percent in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to $27 million in charges for other-than-temporary declines in our equity investments, a $14 million decrease in interest income due to a decrease in short-term investments and a $9 million decrease due to the absence in 2001 of a gain on the sale of real property recorded in 2000. Interest expense increased slightly in 2001 compared to 2000 due to a decrease in capitalized interest expense attributable to the substantial completion of Fab 30 and increased borrowings by our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, AMD Saxony Limited Liability Company & Co. KG (formerly known as AMD Saxony Manufacturing GmbH) (AMD Saxony), offset by the effect of redeeming our 6% convertible subordinated notes in May 2001. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $45 million in 2002, an income tax benefit of $14 million in 2001 and an income tax provision of $257 million in 2000. The 2002 income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions. No tax benefit was recorded in 2002 on pre-tax losses due to the establishment in the fourth quarter of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, due to the incurrence of continuing substantial operating losses, as required under SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” The effective benefit rate of 15.4 percent for 2001 21 Table of Contents was less than the statutory rate because of a 24 percent tax benefit rate on the 2001 restructuring charges, reflecting the allocation of the charges between the U.S. and foreign low-taxed jurisdictions, and a provision for U.S. taxes on certain previously undistributed earnings of low-taxed foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rate was 20.5 percent for 2000. The effective tax rate, excluding the gain on the sale of Legerity, was 14.5 percent, reflecting the benefit of realizing previously reserved deferred tax assets. The tax rate recorded in 2000 attributable to the gain on the sale of Legerity was 37 percent. Other Items International sales as a percent of net sales were 72 percent in 2002, 66 percent in 2001 and 60 percent in 2000. During 2002, approximately one percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The impact on our operating results from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not been material, principally as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Comparison of Segment Income (Loss) In 2002, we operated in two reportable segments: the Core Products segment, which reflects the aggregation of the PC processors, memory products and Other IC products operating segments, and the Foundry Services segment. The Core Products segment includes PC processors, Flash memory devices, EPROMs, embedded processors, platform products, personal connectivity solutions products and networking products. The Foundry Services segment included fees for products sold to Legerity and Vantis. Our previous Voice Communications segment included the voice communications products of our former subsidiary, Legerity. For a comparison of segment net sales, refer to the previous discussions on net sales by product group. The following is a summary of operating income (loss) by segment for 2002, 2001 and 2000: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions) Core Products $ (846 ) $ 72 $ 832 Foundry Services (7 ) (34 ) 22 Voice Communications — — 35 Total $ (853 ) $ 38 $ 889 Core Products segment operating results decreased by $918 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in net sales. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in both average selling prices and unit sales for our core products due to the sustained downturn in the PC, telecommunications and networking equipment industries. The Foundry Services segment operating loss decreased by $27 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the cost savings realized from the closure of Fabs 14 and 15 pursuant to the 2001 Restructuring Plan. The Voice Communications segment operating income was zero in 2002 and 2001 due to our sale of Legerity, effective July 31, 2000. Financial Condition Net cash used in operating activities was $89 million in 2002 primarily as a result of our net loss of $1,303 million, offset by non-cash charges, including $756 million of depreciation and amortization, $311 million of restructuring and other special charges, and other sources of cash of $163 million due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities. 22 Table of Contents At December 29, 2002, inventory increased as compared to December 30, 2001 despite the decrease in sales due to an increase of product to support anticipated 2003 sales, a change in the mix of inventory, and the impact of flash memory production from the conversion of Fab 25. Net cash provided by operating activities was $168 million in 2001 primarily as a result of our net loss of $61 million, adjusted for non-cash charges, including $623 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $82 million of restructuring charges, $27 million of impairment charges on equity investments and $10 million of provision for doubtful accounts, offset by non-cash credits of $98 million from net charges in deferred income taxes and foreign grant and subsidy income, and other uses of cash in operating activities of approximately $423 million due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,206 million in 2000 primarily due to net income of $983 million and depreciation and amortization of $579 million, offset by a nonrecurring $337 million reduction to operating cash flows from the gain on the sale of Legerity, a decrease of $267 million in other assets, an increase of $158 million from income tax benefits from employee stock option exercises, a decrease of $156 million in inventory, an increase of $175 million in payables and accrued liabilities, an increase of $143 million from customer deposits under long-term purchase agreements, a decrease of $140 million in accounts receivable, an increase of $79 million in prepaid expenses and a decrease of $54 million from foreign grant and subsidy income. Net cash used in investing activities was $854 million in 2002 including $705 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment primarily for Fab 30 and Fab 25, $27 million, net of cash acquired, to purchase Alchemy Semiconductor, and $131 million from net purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by $9 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $554 million in 2001 primarily due to $679 million used for the purchases of property, plant, and equipment, primarily for Fab 30 and Asia manufacturing facilities, and $122 million for additional equity investments in FASL, offset by $246 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $816 million in 2000 primarily due to $805 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, offset by $375 million we received from the sale of Legerity and $398 million of net purchases of available-for-sale securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $907 million in 2002 primarily due to $486 million in proceeds, net of $14 million in debt issuance costs, from issuing our $500 million 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022, $391 million in proceeds, net of $11 million in debt issuance costs, from issuing our $402.5 million 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007, $108 million in proceeds from our September 2002 Term Loan Agreement, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs, $120 million in borrowings under our Loan and Security Agreement dated July 13, 1999 (the July 1999 Loan Agreement), $21 million in proceeds from equipment lease financing, $29 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock in connection with stock option exercises and employee purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and $76 million of net capital investment grants and interest subsidies received from the German government as part of the Fab 30 loan agreements. These amounts were offset by $325 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $232 million in 2001 primarily due to $63 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes payable to banks, $308 million in proceeds from Dresden borrowing activities, $38 million in proceeds from the receipt of foreign grants and subsidies and $37 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock in connection with stock option exercises and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, offset by $137 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations and $77 million used to repurchase our common stock. 23 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities was $101 million in 2000 primarily due to $375 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, offset by $136 million in proceeds from borrowing activities, $123 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock and $15 million in proceeds from foreign grants and subsidies. Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees The following tables summarize our principal contractual cash obligations and principal guarantees at December 29, 2002 and are supplemented by the discussion following the tables. Principal Contractual Cash Obligations at December 29, 2002 were: Total Payments due by period 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 and beyond (Thousands) Notes payable to banks $ 913 $ 913 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Term Loan and Security Agreement dated as of September 27, 2002 110,000 27,500 27,500 27,500 27,500 — — 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 500,000 — — — — — 500,000 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 402,500 — — — — 402,500 — Dresden term loans 587,234 30,939 31,252 281,273 243,770 — — Capital lease obligations 44,546 18,381 16,897 5,970 3,298 — — Operating leases 376,730 54,162 48,580 43,550 38,265 20,787 171,386 Unconditional purchase commitments 160,411 50,351 49,960 49,670 2,726 2,568 5,136 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,182,334 $ 182,246 $ 174,189 $ 407,963 $ 315,559 $ 425,855 $ 676,522 Principal Guarantees at December 29, 2002 were: Maximum amounts guaranteed Amounts of guarantee expiration per period 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 and beyond (Thousands) Dresden intercompany guarantee $ 294,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 294,000 $ — $ — BAC payment guarantee 26,044 26,044 — — — — — AMTC payment guarantee 33,336 — — — — 33,336 — AMTC rental guarantee 131,000 — — — — — 131,000 FASL guarantee 208,000 — — — — — 208,000 Fujitsu guarantee 125,000 125,000 — — — — — Total guarantee $ 817,380 $ 151,044 $ — $ — $ 294,000 $ 33,336 $ 339,000 Notes Payable to Banks We entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with a consortium of banks led by a domestic financial institution on July 13, 1999 (the July 1999 Loan Agreement). The July 1999 Loan Agreement provides for a four-year secured revolving line of credit of up to $200 million. We can borrow, subject to amounts that may be set aside by the lenders, up to 85 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from OEMs and 50 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from distributors. We must comply with certain financial covenants if the level of net domestic cash (as defined in the July 1999 Loan Agreement) we hold declines below $200 million or the 24 Table of Contents amount of borrowings under the July 1999 Loan Agreement rises to 50 percent of available credit. At December 29, 2002, net domestic cash, as defined, totaled $718 million. The July 1999 Loan Agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock if the level of our net domestic cash declines below $200 million. Our obligations under the July 1999 Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of all of our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles and the related proceeds. As of December 29, 2002, there was no amount outstanding under the July 1999 Loan Agreement. As of December 29, 2002, we had approximately $18 million in lines of credit available to our foreign subsidiaries under other financing agreements, of which approximately $1 million was outstanding. September 2002 Loan Agreement On September 27, 2002, we entered into a term loan and security agreement with a domestic financial institution (the September 2002 Loan Agreement). Under the agreement, we can borrow up to $155 million to be secured by certain property, plant and equipment located at Fab 25. Amounts borrowed under the September 2002 Loan Agreement bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.8 percent at December 29, 2002. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal and interest installments ending in September 2006. As of December 29, 2002, $110 million was outstanding under the September 2002 Loan Agreement. We must also comply with certain financial covenants if our net domestic cash balance (as defined in the September 2002 Loan Agreement) drops below $300 million. The September 2002 Term Loan Agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock if the level of our net domestic cash declines below $300 million. At December 29, 2002, net domestic cash, as defined, totaled $718 million. We intend to use the amounts borrowed under the September 2002 Loan Agreement for capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes. 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2022 On January 29, 2002, we issued $500 million of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 (the 4.75% Debentures) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The interest rate payable on the 4.75% Debentures will reset on each of August 1, 2008, August 1, 2011 and August 1, 2016 to a rate per annum equal to the interest rate payable 120 days prior to the reset dates on 5-year U.S. Treasury Notes, plus 43 basis points. The interest rate will not be less than 4.75 percent and will not exceed 6.75 percent. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.75% Debentures on February 1, 2009, February 1, 2012, and February 1, 2017. The holders of the 4.75% Debentures will also have the ability to require us to repurchase the 4.75% Debentures in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 4.75% Debentures are convertible by the holders into our common stock at a conversion price of $23.38 per share at any time. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures will be convertible into approximately 43 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $14 million are being amortized ratably, which approximates the interest method, over the term of the 4.75% Debentures as interest expense. Beginning on February 5, 2005, the 4.75% Debentures are redeemable by us for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest at our option, provided that we may not redeem the 4.75% Debentures prior to February 5, 2006 unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 130 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. 25 Table of Contents The redemption prices are as follows for the specified periods: Period Price Beginning on February 5, 2005 through February 4, 2006 102.375% Beginning on February 5, 2006 through February 4, 2007 101.583% Beginning on February 5, 2007 through February 4, 2008 100.792% Beginning on February 5, 2008 100.000% We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our bonds with cash, stock or assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries where we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 On November 25, 2002, we sold $402.5 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) in a registered offering. Interest on the 4.50% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2003. Beginning on December 4, 2005, the 4.50% Notes are redeemable by us at our option for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest provided that we may not redeem the 4.50% Notes unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 150 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of thirty trading days ending within 5 trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices are as follows for the specified periods: Period Price Beginning on December 4, 2005 through November 30, 2006 101.8% Beginning on December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007 100.9% On December 1, 2007 100.0% The 4.50% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2007, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $7.37 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Notes will be convertible into approximately 135 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $12 million are being amortized ratably, which approximates the interest method, over the term of the 4.50% Notes as interest expense. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.50% Notes in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.50% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Dresden Term Loans and Dresden Guarantee AMD Saxony, an indirect wholly owned German subsidiary of AMD, continues to facilitize Fab 30, which began production in the third quarter of 2000. AMD, the Federal Republic of Germany, the State of Saxony and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project. We currently estimate that the construction and facilitization costs of Fab 30 will be $2.6 billion when it is fully equipped by the end of 2005. As of December 29, 2002, we had invested $2.1 billion in AMD Saxony. 26 Table of Contents In March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into a loan agreement and other related agreements (the Dresden Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, in order to finance the project. The Dresden Loan Agreements were amended in February 1998, June 1999, February 2001, June 2002 and December 2002. Because most of the amounts under the Dresden Loan Agreements are denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros), the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate that was permanently fixed on January 1, 1999, of 1.95583 deutsche marks to 1 euro for the conversion of deutsche marks to euros, and then used exchange rate of 0.96 euro to 1 U.S. dollar as of December 29, 2002, to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks into U.S. dollars. The Dresden Loan Agreements, as amended, provide for the funding of the construction and facilitization of Fab 30. This funding consists of: • equity contributions, subordinated and revolving loans and loan guarantees from, and full cost reimbursement through, AMD; • loans from a consortium of banks; and • grants, subsidies and loan guarantees from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony. The Dresden Loan Agreements require that we partially fund Fab 30 project costs in the form of subordinated and revolving loans to, or equity investments in, AMD Saxony. In accordance with the terms of the Dresden Loan Agreements, as of December 29, 2002, we had provided $156 million of subordinated loans, $315 million of revolving loans and $286 million of equity investments in AMD Saxony. These amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. In addition to support from AMD, the consortium of banks referred to above made available up to $799 million in loans to AMD Saxony to help fund Fab 30 project costs. The loans have been fully drawn and a portion has been repaid. AMD Saxony had $587 million of such loans outstanding as of December 29, 2002, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Please refer to the Contractual Cash Obligation table, above, for the repayment schedule, which was revised as part of the December 2002 amendments to the Dresden Loan Agreements. Finally, pursuant to a Subsidy Agreement, as amended in August 2002, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony are supporting the Fab 30 project, in accordance with the Dresden Loan Agreements, in the form of: • guarantees equal to the lesser of 65 percent of AMD Saxony bank debt or $799 million; • capital investment grants and allowances totaling $433 million; and • interest subsidies totaling $160 million. Of these amounts, AMD Saxony received approximately $284 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $98 million in interest subsidies. In addition, AMD Saxony received advanced payments for interest subsidies amounting to $49 million, of which approximately $18 million is restricted from our access for more than one year, and is therefore included in Other Assets. In addition to the above-mentioned subsidies, AMD Saxony also received $31 million in research and development subsidies through December 29, 2002. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long-term liability on our financial statements and are being amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses through December of 2008. The historical rates were used to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros) into U.S. dollars. 27 Table of Contents The Subsidy Agreement, as amended, imposes conditions on AMD Saxony, including the requirement to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2003 and to maintain such headcount until December 2008. Noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. In December 2002, AMD Saxony reduced its anticipated December 2003 employment levels as a result of the 2002 Restructuring Plan (see Note 14). Consequently, the anticipated headcount is below the level required to be maintained by the Subsidy Agreement. Based on these revised headcount estimates, the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available under the Subsidy Agreement would be reduced from $433 million to $379 million. We adjusted the quarterly amortization of these amounts accordingly. There have been no conditions of noncompliance through December 29, 2002 that would result in forfeiture of any of the grants and allowances. The Dresden Loan Agreements, as amended, also require that we: • provide interim funding to AMD Saxony if either the remaining capital investment grants and allowances or the remaining interest subsidies are delayed, such funding to be repaid to AMD as AMD Saxony receives the investment grants and allowances or subsidies from the State of Saxony; • fund shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any default under the Subsidy Agreement caused by AMD Saxony or its affiliates; and • guarantee up to 50 percent of AMD Saxony’s obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements, which guarantee must not be less than $116 million or more than $313 million, until the bank loans are repaid in full. As of December 29, 2002, the amount outstanding under the guarantee was $294 million. As AMD Saxony’s obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements are included in our consolidated financial statements, no incremental liability is recorded under the Dresden guarantee. AMD Saxony would be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements if we, AMD Saxony or AMD Saxony Holding GmbH (AMD Holding) fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events, including: • material variances from the approved plan and specifications; • our failure to fund equity contributions or loans or otherwise comply with our obligations relating to the Dresden Loan Agreements; • the sale of shares in AMD Saxony or AMD Holding; • the failure to pay material obligations; • the occurrence of a material adverse change or filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Saxony or AMD Holding; • the occurrence of a default under the July 1999 Loan Agreement or the September 2002 Loan Agreement; and • noncompliance with specified financial covenants. Generally, any default with respect to borrowings made or guaranteed by AMD that results in recourse to us of more than $2.5 million, and that is not cured by us, would result in a cross-default under the Dresden Loan Agreements, the July 1999 Loan Agreement and the September 2002 Loan Agreement. As of December 29, 2002, we were in compliance with all conditions of the Dresden Loan Agreements. In the event we are unable to meet our obligations to AMD Saxony as required under the Dresden Loan Agreements, we will be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements, the July 1999 Loan Agreement and the September 2002 Loan Agreement, which would permit acceleration of certain indebtedness, which could have a 28 Table of Contents material adverse effect on us. The occurrence of a default under these agreements would likely result in a cross-default under the Indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and 4.50% Notes. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 29, 2002, we had capital lease obligations of approximately $45 million. Obligations under these lease agreements are collateralized by the assets leased and are payable through 2006. Leased assets consist principally of machinery and equipment. Operating Leases, Unconditional Purchase Commitments and Other Operating Commitments We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, under lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2018. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future lease obligations as of December 29, 2002 were approximately $377 million, of which $137 million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We enter into purchase commitments for manufacturing supplies and services. Total purchase commitments as of December 29, 2002 were approximately $160 million for periods through 2009. FASL Facilities and Guarantees FASL, a joint venture formed by AMD and Fujitsu Limited in 1993, operates advanced integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, to produce Flash memory devices. FASL is continuing the facilitization of its second and third Flash memory device wafer fabrication facilities, FASL JV2 and FASL JV3. We expect FASL JV2 and FASL JV3, including equipment, to cost approximately $2.1 billion when fully equipped. As of December 29, 2002, approximately $1.6 billion of these costs had been funded by cash generated primarily from FASL operations and borrowings by FASL. These costs are incurred in Japanese yen and are, therefore, subject to change due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. On December 29, 2002, the exchange rate was 119.97 yen to one U.S. dollar. We use this rate to translate the amounts denominated in yen into U.S. dollars. A significant portion of FASL capital expenditures in 2003 will continue to be funded by cash generated from FASL operations. However, to the extent that additional funds are required for the full facilitization of FASL JV2 and FASL JV3, we will be required to contribute cash or guarantee third-party loans in proportion to our 49.992 percent interest in FASL, up to 25 billion yen ($208 million). As of December 29, 2002, we had $121 million in loan guarantees outstanding with respect to these third-party loans. In 2000, FASL further expanded its production capacity through a foundry arrangement with Fujitsu Microelectronics, Inc. (FMI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu Limited. In connection with FMI equipping its wafer fabrication facility in Gresham, Oregon (the Gresham Facility) to produce flash memory devices for sale to FASL, we agreed to guarantee the repayment of up to $125 million of Fujitsu’s obligations as a co-signer with FMI under its global multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with a third-party bank (the Fujitsu Guarantee). On November 30, 2001, Fujitsu announced that it was closing the Gresham Facility, due to the downturn of the flash memory market. To date we have not received notice from Fujitsu that FMI has defaulted on any payments due under the Credit Facility. Fujitsu has requested that we pay the entire $125 million under the Fujitsu Guarantee. We continue to disagree with Fujitsu as to the amount, if any, of our obligations under the Fujitsu Guarantee. While we continue to discuss this matter with Fujitsu, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter. Accordingly, we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the Fujitsu Guarantee. 29 Table of Contents Advanced Mask Technology Center Guarantee and BAC Guarantee The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co., KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by us, Infineon Technologies AG and Dupont Photomasks, Inc. for the purpose of constructing and operating a new advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. In June 2002, BAC entered into a $78 million bridge loan (Bridge Loan) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank for the purpose of constructing the facility. We guaranteed the payment obligations of BAC under the Bridge Loan, in an amount not to exceed $26 million plus interest and expenses. In December 2002, BAC and AMTC executed a facility agreement, consisting of a $125 million revolving credit facility (Revolving Loan) and a $78 million term loan facility (Term Loan), with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank. The Term Loan will supercede and replace the Bridge Loan. We guaranteed the payment obligations of AMTC, in an amount not to exceed $33 million plus interest and expenses, under the Revolving Loan. In addition, we guaranteed the payment obligations of BAC, in an amount not to exceed $26 million plus interest and expenses, under the Term Loan. In December 2002, the AMTC and BAC entered into a rental agreement with respect to the photomask facility. The rental agreement will become effective upon completion of construction of the photomask facility. We guaranteed approximately 23% of the payment obligations of AMTC under the rental agreement, which we believe will be equal to approximately $17 million, initially and diminish over time through 2011 as the Term Loan is repaid. Our rental guarantee replaces our guarantee of the Term Loan. In addition, in the event the other tenant of the photomask facility defaults under its rental agreement, and the AMTC assumes the defaulting tenant’s lease and related lease obligations, we would be required to guarantee 23% of these additional rental payment obligations. Further, in the event one of the three joint venture partners is unable to meet its guarantee obligations with respect to AMTC’s additional rental payment obligations, the remaining joint venture partners agreed to assume, on a pro rata basis, the defaulting partner’s guarantee obligations with respect to AMTC’s additional rental payment only. Assuming the other tenant of the photomask facility defaults under the rental agreement and AMTC exercises its option to assume the defaulting tenant’s obligations under its rental agreement, and assuming a default under the rental guarantee by both Infineon and Dupont, the maximum potential amount of our guarantee obligations for these rental payments would be approximately $131 million. As of December 29, 2002, no amounts were drawn under the Revolving Loan or the Term Loan and we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the guarantees. Other Financial Activities We plan to make capital investments of approximately $650 million during 2003, including amounts related to the continued facilitization of Fab 30 and Fab 25. We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances, together with available external financing and the extension of existing facilities, will be sufficient to fund operations and capital investments for at least the next 12 months. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142). SFAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives (but with no maximum life). The amortization provisions of SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the amortization and impairment provisions of SFAS 142 are effective upon the adoption of SFAS 142. We adopted SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 at the beginning of 2002. These accounting standards did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS 144), which supersedes both Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” (SFAS 121) and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions” (Opinion 30), for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). SFAS 144 retains the fundamental provisions in SFAS 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets to be “held and used.” In addition, the statement provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test, requires that a long-lived asset or group of assets to be disposed of other than by sale be classified as “held-and-used” until they are disposed of, and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset or group of assets as “held for sale.” SFAS 144 also retains the basic provisions of Opinion 30 on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity (rather than a segment of a business). We adopted FAS 144 at the beginning of 2002, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” (EITF 94-3). The principal difference between SFAS 146 and EITF 94-3 relates to SFAS 146’s timing for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for an exit cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94-3, a liability for an exit cost, as generally defined in EITF 94-3, was recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We will adopt SFAS 146 prospectively as of December 30, 2002, the beginning of fiscal year 2003, and, therefore, its adoption is not expected to have any impact on our current financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements regarding its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The provisions related to the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements of periods ending after December 15, 2002. The provisions related to recognition and measurement are applicable prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. As required, we have adopted the disclosure provisions in the financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2002. We are still in the process of assessing FIN 45’s recognition and initial measurement requirements, and, at this point, do not believe the adoption of FIN 45 will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure” (SFAS 148), which provides for alternative methods to transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock options in accordance with provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,” In addition, SFAS 148 requires disclosure of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stock-based compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. We adopted the annual disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 in the financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2002 and will adopt the interim disclosure requirements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The transition provisions of SFAS 148 are currently not applicable to us as we continue to account for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. 31 Table of Contents In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46). Variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. Formerly “Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entities” in its draft form, this interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on how to identity them and also on how an enterprise should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. Generally, FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. For existing variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, the provision of this interpretation will apply no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. Currently, we do not have any variable interest entities, and we do not expect the adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Risk Factors We have recently experienced substantial declines in revenues and increases in operating losses, and we may experience additional declines in revenues and increases in operating losses in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and our future financial results are anticipated to be, subject to substantial fluctuations. Our total revenues for 2002 were $2,697 million compared to $3,892 million for 2001. This decline was due primarily to reduced demand for our products resulting from the current economic slowdown and our decision primarily in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 to limit shipments and to accept receipt of product returns from certain customers, each as part of our efforts to reduce excess PC processor inventory in the overall supply chain. We incurred a net loss of $1.3 billion for 2002 compared to a net loss of $61 million for 2001. Reduced end-user demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business in the near term and we may experience additional declines in revenue and operating losses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that, if we do, we will be able to sustain it. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is currently experiencing a severe downturn, that is adversely affecting, and may continue to adversely affect, our business. The highly cyclical semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles, manufacturing overcapacity and declines in general economic conditions. The most recent downturn, which began in the fourth quarter of 2000 and continues today, has been severe and prolonged, and future downturns may also be severe and prolonged. Our financial performance has been negatively affected by these downturns, including the incurrence of substantial losses during the current downturn, as a result of: • the cyclical nature of the supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; • a decline in demand for end-user products that incorporate our semiconductors; • excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including our customers; • excess production capacity; and • accelerated declines in average selling prices. If current conditions do not improve in the near term or if these conditions in the semiconductor industry occur in the future, as they likely will to a lesser or greater degree, our business will continue to be adversely affected. Fluctuations in the personal computer market may continue to materially adversely affect us. Our business is, and particularly our PC processor product lines are, tied to the personal computer industry. Industry-wide fluctuations in the PC marketplace, including the current industry downturn that commenced in 2001 and has continued throughout 2002 have materially adversely affected us and may materially adversely affect us in the 32 Table of Contents future. If we continue to experience a sustained reduction in the growth rate of PCs sold, sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease. In addition, current trends of consolidation within the personal computer industry, as recently evidenced by the Hewlett-Packard/Compaq merger, as well as potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from Intel Corporation, such as Dell Corporation, could further materially adversely affect us. We plan for significant capital expenditures in 2003 and beyond and if we cannot generate the capital required for these capital expenditures and other ongoing operating expenses through operating cash flow and external financing activities, we may be materially adversely affected. We plan to continue to make significant capital expenditures to support our microprocessor and Flash memory products both in the near and long term, including approximately $650 million during 2003. These capital expenditures include those relating to the continued facilitization of Fab 30 and Fab 25. These capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and will also decrease our cash balances. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities including debt and equity. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, our July 1999 Loan Agreement is scheduled to expire in July 2003. Our inability to obtain needed debt and/or equity financing would have a material adverse effect on us. In March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into the Dresden Loan Agreements and other related agreements. These agreements require that we partially fund Fab 30 project costs in the form of subordinated and revolving loans to, or equity investments in, AMD Saxony. We currently estimate that the maximum construction and facilitization costs to us of Fab 30 will be $2.6 billion when fully equipped by the end of 2005. We had invested $2.1 billion as of December 29, 2002. If we are unable to meet our obligations to AMD Saxony as required under these agreements, we will be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements, which would permit acceleration of $587 million of indebtedness, as well as acceleration by cross-default of our obligations under our other borrowing arrangements. Our joint venture with Fujitsu Limited, FASL, continues to facilitize its manufacturing facilities in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, known as FASL JV2 and FASL JV3. We expect FASL JV2 and FASL JV3, including equipment, to cost approximately $2.1 billion when fully equipped. As of December 29, 2002, approximately $1.6 billion of this cost had been funded. To the extent that additional funds are required for the full facilitization of FASL JV2 and FASL JV3, we will be required to contribute cash or guarantee third-party loans in proportion to our 49.992 percent interest in FASL. We have a substantial amount of debt and debt service obligations, and may incur additional debt, that could adversely affect our financial position. We have a substantial amount of debt and we may incur additional debt in the future. At December 29, 2002, our total debt was $1.9 billion and stockholders’ equity was $2.5 billion. In addition, we had up to $200 million of availability under our July 1999 Loan Agreement (subject to our borrowing base). We had also guaranteed approximately $817 million of debt, and we are currently in disagreement as to the amount we owe, if any, under our additional guarantee to repay up to $125 million to Fujitsu in connection with a closed wafer fabrication facility in Gresham, Oregon. None of these guaranteed amounts are reflected as debt on our balance sheet. Our high degree of leverage may: • limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; • require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; 33 Table of Contents • limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and • increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and, to the extent of our outstanding debt under our September 2002 Loan Agreement, the impact of increases in interest rates. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt or our guarantees of other parties’ debts will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt, or meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements or that we will be able to extend the July 1999 Loan Agreement. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Intense competition in the integrated circuit industry may materially adversely affect us. The integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive. Products compete on performance, quality, reliability, price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, marketing and distribution capability, brand recognition and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, competitors enter the market and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. Failure to reduce our costs on existing products or to develop and introduce, on a cost-effective and timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products with higher margins, would have a material adverse effect on us. Intel Corporation’s dominance of the PC processor market may limit our ability to compete effectively in that market. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in PCs for many years. As a result, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and dictate the type of products the market requires of Intel’s competitors. In addition, the financial strength of Intel allows it to market its product aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for us and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel also exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the “Intel Inside” brand program and other marketing programs. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by its: • pricing and allocation strategies and actions; • product mix and introduction schedules; • product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; • control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers; and • user brand loyalty. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the marketplace as well as to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly expends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do. In marketing our microprocessors to OEMs and dealers, we depend on third-party companies other than Intel for the design and manufacture of core-logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and 34 Table of Contents other components. In recent years, many of these third-party designers and manufacturers have lost significant market share to Intel or exited the business. In addition, these companies produce chipsets, motherboards, BIOS software and other components to support each new generation of Intel’s microprocessors, and Intel has significant leverage over their business opportunities. Our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. Our ability to compete with Intel in the market for AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Opteron microprocessors will depend on our ability to ensure that PC platforms are designed to support our microprocessors. A failure of the designers and producers of motherboards, chipsets and other system components to support our microprocessor offerings would have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to develop, produce and successfully market higher-performing microprocessor products, we may be materially adversely affected. The microprocessor market is characterized by short product life cycles and migration to ever-higher performance microprocessors. To compete successfully, we must transition to new process technologies at a fast pace and offer higher-performance microprocessors in significantly greater volumes. If we fail to achieve yield and volume goals or to offer higher-performance microprocessors in significant volume on a timely basis and at competitive prices, we could be materially adversely affected. To be successful, we must increase sales of our microprocessor products to existing customers and develop new customers in both consumer and commercial markets, particularly the latter. Our production and sales plans for microprocessors are subject to other risks and uncertainties, including: • our ability to continue offering new higher performance microprocessors competitive with Intel’s product offerings; • our ability to introduce and create successful marketing positions for the upcoming AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors, which rely in part on market acceptance and demand for 64-bit microprocessors based on x86 technology. • our ability to maintain and improve the successful marketing position of the AMD Athlon XP microprocessor, which relies in part on market acceptance of a metric based on overall processor performance versus processor clock speed (measured in megahertz frequency); • our ability to maintain adequate selling prices of microprocessors despite increasingly aggressive Intel pricing strategies, marketing programs, new product introductions and product bundlings of microprocessors, motherboards and chipsets; • our ability, on a timely basis, to produce microprocessors in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; • the pace at which we expect to be able to convert production in Fab 30 to 90 nanometer copper interconnect process; • our ability to attract and retain engineering and design talent; • our ability to expand system design capabilities; and • the availability and acceptance of motherboards and chipsets designed for our microprocessors. Our ability to increase microprocessor product revenues and benefit fully from the substantial investments we have made and continue to make related to microprocessors depends on the continuing success of our AMD Athlon microprocessors and the success of future generations of microprocessors, most immediately the AMD Opteron processor, and later this year the AMD Athlon 64 processor. If we fail to achieve continued and expanded market acceptance of our microprocessors, we may be materially adversely affected. We must introduce in a timely manner, and achieve market acceptance for, our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors, or we will be materially adversely affected. We plan to ship our AMD Opteron 35 Table of Contents processors in April 2003 and our AMD Athlon 64 processors in September 2003. These processors are designed to provide high performance for both 32-bit and 64-bit applications in servers and in desktop and mobile PCs. The success of these processors is subject to risks and uncertainties including our ability to produce them in a timely manner on new process technologies, including silicon-on-insulator technology, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; their market acceptance; the availability, performance and feature set of motherboards and chipsets designed for our eighth-generation processors; and the support of the operating system and application program providers for our 64-bit instruction set. If we were to lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products, our ability to market our processors would be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends on support from Microsoft in its operating systems. If Microsoft does not provide support in its operating systems for our x86 instruction sets, including our x86-64 technology that will be introduced with our AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Opteron processors, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations. If we fail to retain the support and certification of Microsoft, our ability to market our processors could be materially adversely affected. The completion and impact of our restructuring program and cost reductions could adversely affect us. On November 7, 2002, we announced that we were formulating the 2002 Restructuring Plan to address the continuing industry-wide weakness in the semiconductor industry by adjusting our cost structure to industry conditions. Pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan, we intend to reduce our fixed costs as a percentage of total costs over time from approximately 80 percent to approximately 70 percent. We also expect to reduce our expenses by approximately $100 million per quarter by the second quarter of 2003. As a result, we expect total expenses in 2003 to be reduced by approximately $350 million based on current product demand forecasts. We cannot, however, be sure that the goals of the 2002 Restructuring Plan will be realized. The ultimate effects of the 2002 Restructuring Plan could prove to be adverse. Weak market demand for our Flash memory products, the loss of a significant customer in the high-end mobile telephone market, or any difficulty in our transition to Mirrorbit technology may have a material adverse effect on us. The demand for Flash memory devices has been weak due to the sustained downturn in the communications and networking equipment industries and excess inventories held by our customers. In the third and fourth quarters of this year, our Flash memory product sales grew almost entirely based on strength in the high-end mobile phone market. Our sales in that market are concentrated in a few customers. In addition, we expect competition in the market for Flash memory devices to continue to increase as competing manufacturers introduce new products and industry-wide production capacity increases. We may be unable to maintain or increase our market share in Flash memory devices as the market develops and Intel and other competitors introduce new competing products. A decline in unit sales of our Flash memory devices, lower average selling prices, or a loss of a significant customer in the high-end mobile phone market, would have a material adverse effect on us. In July 2002, we commenced production shipments of our first product with MirrorBit technology. Our MirrorBit technology is a new memory cell architecture that enables Flash memory products to hold twice as much data as standard Flash memory devices. A lack of customer acceptance, any substantial difficulty in transitioning our Flash memory products to MirrorBit technology or any future process technology could reduce our ability to be competitive in the market and could have a material adverse effect on us. We rely on our joint venture with Fujitsu, FASL, and if that joint venture is terminated or amended significantly, we could be materially adversely affected. We continue to rely on our joint venture with Fujitsu, FASL, to manufacture our Flash memory devices. In addition, beginning in 2002, Fab 25 began operating as a foundry to FASL and as of year end, Fab 25 was devoted entirely to Flash memory device production for FASL. While the FASL joint venture has been successful to date, there can be no assurance that we and Fujitsu will elect to continue the joint venture in its current form, in some other form or at all, which could have a material adverse affect on us. 36 Table of Contents Our memory products are based on the NOR architecture and a significant market shift to the NAND architecture could materially adversely affect us. Our memory products are based on the NOR architecture, and any significant shift in the marketplace to products based on the NAND architecture will reduce the total market available to us and therefore reduce our market share, which could have a materially adverse affect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may affect demand for our products and slow payment by our customers. The economic slowdown in the United States and worldwide, exacerbated by the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and consequences of sustained military action, has adversely affected demand for our microprocessors, Flash memory devices and other integrated circuits. A continued decline of the worldwide semiconductor market or a significant decline in economic conditions in any significant geographic area would likely decrease the overall demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If the economic slowdown continues or worsens as a result of terrorist activities, military action or otherwise, it could adversely impact our customers’ ability to pay us in a timely manner. Manufacturing capacity utilization rates may adversely affect us. At times we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products. We are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by making significant capital investments in Fab 30, Fab 25, FASL JV3 and our test and assembly facility in Suzhou, China. If the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations, we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities, and we could be materially adversely affected. This has in the past had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow. There may also be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with others, could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, during periods when we are implementing new process technologies, our manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions in Fab 30 to smaller than 130 nanometer process technologies employing silicon-on-insulator technology could have a material adverse effect on us. At this time, the most significant risk is underutilization of our manufacturing capacity. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. We and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance. Impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. From time to time, we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities, transferring production to other facilities, and in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields. We cannot be sure that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, transferring production to other facilities, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies, which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development of process technologies in an effort 37 Table of Contents to improve the technologies and equipment used to fabricate our products. For example, the successful development and implementation of silicon-on-insulator technology is critical to our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop or obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to fabricate future generations of our products profitably. Further, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive. If our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our July 1999 Loan Agreement and our September 2002 Loan Agreement contain restrictive covenants and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when our net domestic cash is below specified amounts, and the Dresden Loan Agreements imposes restrictive covenants on AMD Saxony, including a prohibition on its ability to pay dividends. Our ability to satisfy the covenants, financial ratios and tests of our debt instruments can be affected by events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under our July 1999 Loan Agreement, our September 2002 Loan Agreement and/or the Dresden Loan Agreements. The occurrence of an event of default under any of these agreements or under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and our 4.50% Notes would likely result in a cross-default under the agreements covering the other borrowings and would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the July 1999 Loan Agreement, the September 2002 Loan Agreement and the Dresden Loan Agreements could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our personal property, including inventory and accounts receivable, as security under our July 1999 Loan Agreement, and certain property, plant and equipment as security under our September 2002 Loan Agreement, and AMD Saxony has pledged substantially all of its property as security under the Dresden Loan Agreements. If the lenders under any of the credit facilities or the noteholders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and our 4.50% Notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. One or more of our products may be found to be defective after the product has been shipped to customers in volume. The cost of a recall, software fix, product replacements and/or product returns may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, modifications needed to fix the defect may impede performance of the product. If essential raw materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Certain raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials, we might have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on us. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products are performed at our manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, Thailand, China and Singapore; or by subcontractors in the United States 38 Table of Contents and Asia. We also depend on foreign foundry suppliers and joint ventures for the manufacture of a portion of our finished silicon wafers and have international sales operations. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include: • expropriation; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • difficulty in protecting our intellectual property; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls; • changes in freight and interest rates; • disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and • loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. As part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in emerging overseas markets. Expansion into emerging overseas markets presents similar political and economic risks as described above, and we may be unsuccessful in our strategy to penetrate these emerging overseas markets. Our inability to continue to attract and retain key personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous key engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be otherwise adversely affected. Our operating results are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, our revenues are generally higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter of each year. This seasonal pattern is largely a result of decreased demand in Europe during the summer months and higher demand in the retail sector of the PC market during the winter holiday season. In recent quarters, a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have been made in the last month of the quarter. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could materially adversely affect us. Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and we generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory. During 2002, the markets in which our customers operate were characterized by a decline in end-user demand which reduced visibility of future demand for our products and resulted in high levels of inventories in the PC industry supply chain. In some cases, this led to delays in payments for our products. We believe that these and other factors could continue to materially adversely affect our revenues in the near term. Our price protection obligations and return rights under specific provisions in our agreements with distributors may adversely affect us. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most 39 Table of Contents instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as products that are slow moving or have been discontinued. These agreements, which may be canceled by either party on a specified notice, generally allow for the return of our products. The price protection and return rights we offer to our distributors could materially adversely affect us if distributors exercise these rights as a result of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products or otherwise. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property, in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We may not be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property, in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Further, patent applications that we file may not be issued. Despite our efforts to protect our rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to cost-effectively monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that all necessary licenses can be obtained on satisfactory terms, if at all. We could decide, in the alternative, to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others will always be avoided or successfully concluded. Failure to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing process, cessation of operations or sales, and criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment; to modify product designs; or to incur other expenses associated with compliance with environmental regulations. Any failure to control the use of, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred in New York and Washington, DC on September 11, 2001, and other acts of violence or war may materially adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations. These attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our sales. Also as a result of terrorism, the United States may be included in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales, our supply chain, and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business or your investment. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or exacerbate economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results, revenues and costs and may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future prices of our securities. Our corporate headquarters, assembly and research and development activities are located in an earthquake zone and these operations could be interrupted in the event of an earthquake. Our corporate 40 Table of Contents headquarters, assembly operations in California and research and development activities related to process technologies are located near major earthquake fault lines. In the event of a major earthquake, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and/or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect us. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In order to reduce this interest rate risk, we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities. As of December 29, 2002, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short term investments and they consisted primarily of money market funds, short term corporate notes, short term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short term federal agency notes. The majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term. We continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate. We do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We use proceeds from debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital needs. 41 Table of Contents The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 29, 2002 and comparable fair values as of December 30, 2001: 2002 2001 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Fair value Fair value (Thousands) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 14,265 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 14,265 $ 14,276 $ 126,379 Weighted-average rate 1.39% — — — — — Variable rate amounts $ 108,908 — — — — — $ 108,908 $ 109,076 $ 152,140 Weighted-average rate 1.34% — — — — — Short-term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 64,934 $ 138,604 $ 108,382 $ 21,421 — — $ 333,341 $ 336,494 $ 426,359 Weighted-average rate 2.60% 2.55% 2.99% 4.29% — — Variable rate amounts $ 271,261 — $ 1,000 — — — $ 272,261 $ 272,463 $ 16,350 Weighted-average rate 1.74% — 2.18% — — — Long-term equity investments: Equity investments — — — — — $ 8,023 $ 8,023 $ 7,885 $ 19,342 Fixed rate amounts — $ 12,433 — — — — $ 12,433 $ 12,554 $ 13,323 Weighted-average rate — 1.88% — — — — Total Investment Portfolio $ 459,368 $ 151,037 $ 109,382 $ 21,421 $ — $ 8,023 $ 749,231 $ 752,748 $ 753,893 Debt Obligations Debt—fixed rate amounts $ 30,939 $ 31,252 $ 281,273 $ 243,770 $ 402,500 $ 500,000 $ 1,489,734 $ 1,384,611 $ 571,679 Weighted-average rate 4.22% 4.29% 5.05% 5.09% 4.50% 4.75% — — — Debt—variable rateamounts $ 27,500 $ 27,500 $ 27,500 $ 27,500 $ — $ — $ 110,000 $ 109,524 $ — Weighted-average rate 5.80% 5.80% 5.81% 5.88% — — — — — Notes payable to banks $ 913 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 913 $ 913 $ 63,362 Weighted-average rate 5.26% — — — — — — — — Capital leases $ 12,909 $ 18,691 $ 5,507 $ 3,214 $ — $ — $ 40,321 $ 36,587 $ 31,550 Weighted-average rate 14.92% 8.27% 8.40% 2.63% — — — — — Total Debt Obligations $ 72,261 $ 77,443 $ 314,280 $ 274,484 $ 402,500 $ 500,000 $ 1,640,968 $ 1,531,635 $ 666,591 Foreign Exchange Risk. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures in our foreign sales subsidiaries, on liabilities for products purchased from FASL and AMD Saxony and for foreign currency denominated fixed asset purchase commitments. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We had an aggregate of $492 million (notional amount) of short-term foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts denominated in Japanese yen, European Union euro and Singapore dollar outstanding as of December 29, 2002. Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 29, 2002 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. 42 Table of Contents The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2003, which are included in this annual report. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Overview We design, manufacture and market industry-standard digital integrated circuits that are used in diverse product applications such as desktop and mobile PCs, workstations and servers, communications equipment, and automotive and consumer electronics. Our products include microprocessors, Flash memory devices, and Personal Connectivity Solutions products. The semiconductor industry has recently shown signs of recovery from the downturn experienced during 2001 and 2002, which contributed to an improvement in our operating results during 2003 compared to 2002. Total net sales for 2003 of $3,519 million increased 30 percent compared with net sales of $2,697 million for 2002. This increase was driven primarily by increased sales of microprocessors and Flash memory products across all geographies as well as the consolidation of FASL LLC’s results of operations, which include sales by FASL LLC to Fujitsu. In addition, the restructuring and cost-cutting measures that we initiated in 2002 contributed to significant cost savings in 2003. These cost savings, combined with the increase in revenues, contributed to a 79 percent decrease in net loss from a net loss of $1,303 million in 2002 to a net loss of $274 million in 2003. During 2003, we reached an agreement with Fujitsu to form FASL LLC. The formation of FASL LLC has allowed us to combine our and Fujitsu’s product manufacturing and technology development efforts to respond more quickly to the demands of our Flash memory product customers. As a result of the transaction, we began consolidating FASL LLC’s results of operations on June 30, 2003. However, as FASL LLC did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of operations for prior periods did not include the consolidation of FASL LLC’s operations. Accordingly, the segment operating information for our Memory Products segment for the year ended December 28, 2003, is not fully comparable to the segment information for all prior periods presented. In addition, we introduced our 64-bit microprocessor products during 2003 with the launch of our AMD Opteron processor for servers and workstations in April and our AMD Athlon 64 processor for desktop and mobile PCs in September. In November 2003, we began construction of a new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany, which we expect to be in volume production in 2006. We believe the new capacity provided by this facility will allow us to satisfy anticipated demand for our 64-bit microprocessors. In addition to providing increased capacity, we believe that manufacturing our 64-bit processors on 300-millimeter silicon wafers, and employing advanced manufacturing process technologies, will allow us to reduce our manufacturing costs. For 2004, we believe critical success factors include: increasing market acceptance of 64-bit computing; our and FASL LLC’s ability to successfully develop and transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies; our ability to develop and introduce new products for the server and workstation markets on a timely basis and increasing our share of those markets; expanding our participation in emerging global markets, including China, Latin America, India, and Eastern Europe; improving our share of the Flash memory market, including enabling the increased adoption of MirrorBit technology; and maximizing the synergies of FASL LLC. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. 20 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenues, inventories, asset impairments, restructuring charges, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales and a provision for estimated future price reductions in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on management judgment while considering actual historical sales returns, historical price reductions, market activity, allowances, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. Actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near-term factory production planning. Inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand of generally six months or less, are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. We adjust remaining inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. If we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. To the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins, we would disclose them. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset’s carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. Restructuring Charges. We record and account for our restructuring activities following formally approved plans that identify the actions and timeline over which the restructuring activities will occur. Restructuring charges include estimates pertaining to employee severance and fringe benefit costs, facility exit 21 Table of Contents costs, subleasing assumptions and facility and equipment decommissioning costs resulting from exiting certain facilities. We review remaining restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis and adjust these accruals when changes in facts and circumstances suggest actual amounts will differ from our estimates. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual costs may be different than our original or revised estimates. These changes in estimates can result in increases or decreases to our results of operations in future periods and would be presented on the restructuring and other special charges, net, line of our consolidated operating statements. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In fiscal 2002, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets at the time. In fiscal 2003, we continued to provide a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed, resulting in a benefit to our earnings. Such benefits would be recorded on the income tax provision (benefit) line of our statement of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. Commitments and Contingencies. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. We are also a party to environmental matters, including local, regional, state and federal government cleanup activities at or near locations where we currently or have in the past conducted our business. We are also a guarantor of various third-party obligations and commitments. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies, if any, that would be charged to earnings includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances, such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made. Results Of Operations As discussed above in the section entitled, “Developments in 2003,” on page 1, effective June 30, 2003, we and Fujitsu formed FASL LLC. As a result of the transaction, we began consolidating FASL LLC’s results of operations on June 30, 2003. Prior to June 30, 2003, we accounted for our share of the Manufacturing Joint Venture’s operating results under the equity method. As FASL LLC did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of our operations for periods prior to the third quarter of 2003 do not include the consolidation of FASL LLC’s results of operations. Accordingly, our operating results for the year ended December 28, 2003 are not fully comparable with our results for prior periods. As we have a 60 percent controlling interest in FASL LLC, Fujitsu’s 40 percent share in the net income (loss) of FASL LLC is reflected as a minority interest adjustment to our consolidated financial statements. This minority interest adjustment will not correspond to Memory Products segment operating income (loss) because Memory Products segment operating income (loss) includes operations incremental to those of FASL LLC. In addition, the minority interest calculation is based on FASL LLC’s net income (loss) rather than operating income (loss). 22 Table of Contents We review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income before interest, taxes and minority interest. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management judgment. Prior to the third quarter of 2003, we had two reportable segments: the Core Products and Foundry Services segments. Primarily as a result of the formation of FASL LLC, we re-evaluated our reportable segments. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, we changed our reportable segments to: the Computation Products segment, which includes microprocessor products for desktop and mobile PCs, servers and workstations and chipset products, and the Memory Products segment, which includes Flash memory products. We believe that separate reporting of these operating segments, given our new focus on FASL LLC as a separate operating company and its separate market brand—Spansion, provides more useful information to our stockholders. In addition to our reportable segments, we also have the All Other category that is not a reportable segment, but rather it includes other small operating segments that are neither individually nor in the aggregate greater than ten percent of our consolidated revenues or assets. This category also includes certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to the operating segments. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. However, as FASL LLC did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of operations for prior periods did not include the consolidation of FASL LLC’s operations. Accordingly, the segment operating information for the Memory Products segment for the year ended December 28, 2003, is not fully comparable to the reclassified segment information for all prior periods presented. We use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in December. The years ended December 28, 2003, December 29, 2002, and December 30, 2001, each included 52 weeks. The following is a summary of our net sales for 2003, 2002 and 2001. 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Computation Products $ 1,960 $ 1,756 $ 2,466 Memory Products 1,419 741 1,133 All Other 140 200 293 Total $ 3,519 $ 2,697 $ 3,892 Net Sales Comparison for Years Ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 Total net sales of $3,519 million in 2003 increased 30 percent compared to net sales of $2,697 million in 2002. Computation Products net sales of $1,960 million in 2003 increased 12 percent compared to net sales of $1,756 million in 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily due to a 15 percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments due primarily to increased demand from our OEM customers, partially offset by a decline of four percent in the average selling prices of our microprocessor products. Unit shipment growth was particularly strong in Latin America and China, which accounted for 77 percent of overall unit growth. Memory Products net sales of $1,419 million in 2003 increased 92 percent compared to net sales of $741 million in 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the effect of consolidating FASL LLC’s results of operations, which include FASL LLC’s sales to Fujitsu, and increased demand for Flash memory products. Further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between AMD and Fujitsu. All Other net sales of $140 million in 2003 decreased 30 percent compared to net sales of $200 million in 2002 and consisted primarily of net sales of our Personal Connectivity Solutions products. The decrease was due 23 Table of Contents to a $53 million decrease in revenue resulting from discontinued production of selected mature embedded processors and networking products and a $34 million decrease in Foundry Services revenue, offset by a $28 million increase in revenues from sales of AMD Geode and wireless products. Net Sales Comparison for Years Ended December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001 Total net sales of $2,697 million in 2002 decreased 31 percent compared to net sales of $3,892 million in 2001. Computation Products net sales of $1,756 million in 2002 decreased 29 percent compared to net sales of $2,466 million in 2001. This decrease was almost wholly due to a decrease in unit sales of 16 percent, and a decrease in average selling prices of 13 percent, reflecting industry-wide weakness in PC sales, competitive pricing pressure, and the execution of our plan to align our microprocessor inventory in the supply chain with forecasted customer demand, which included our decision to limit shipments and accept receipt of product returns from certain customers. Memory Products net sales of $741 million in 2002 decreased 35 percent compared to net sales of $1,133 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices of 36 percent, reflecting continued weakness in the telecommunications and networking equipment industries. All Other net sales of $200 million in 2002 decreased 32 percent compared to net sales of $293 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Foundry Services revenues of approximately $64 million and a decrease in net sales of $31 million from embedded processors and networking products as a result of sustained market declines in the communications and networking equipment industries. Comparison of Gross Margin Percentage, Expenses, Interest Income and Other, Net, and Interest Expense The following is a summary of gross margin percentage, expenses and interest income and other, net, and interest expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 (Millions except for gross margin percentage) Cost of sales $ 2,327 $ 2,106 $ 2,590 Gross margin percentage 34 % 22 % 33 % Research and development 852 816 651 Marketing, general and administrative 587 670 620 Restructuring and other special charges, net (14 ) 331 89 Interest income and other, net 21 32 26 Interest expense 110 71 61 Income tax provision (benefit) 3 45 (14 ) Gross margin percentage increased to 34 percent in 2003 compared to 22 percent in 2002. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of 30 percent, accompanied by an increase in cost of sales of only ten percent. Our cost of sales increased at a lower rate than net sales primarily due to cost reductions from the 2002 Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives. In addition, microprocessor unit sales increased 15 percent while average selling prices of microprocessor products decreased by four percent, and we realized $63 million, or approximately two percentage points resulting from the sale of microprocessor products that had been previously written off. Further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of FASL LLC’s operating results on June 30, 2003. We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The 24 Table of Contents amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as credits to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credits to cost of sales totaled $46.2 million in 2003 and $37.5 million in 2002. Gross margin percentage decreased to 22 percent in 2002 compared to 33 percent in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a 31 percent decrease in the combined sales of PC processors and Flash memory products, as a result of lower unit demand and average selling prices due to weakened customer demand and industry-wide excess inventory, partially offset by cost savings realized from the closure of certain facilities pursuant to the 2001 Restructuring Plan, which is discussed below. Research and development expenses of $852 million in 2003 increased four percent from $816 million in 2002 due primarily to an increase in expenses as a result of the FASL LLC transaction, $23 million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors, and $58 million in expenses related to amounts paid to IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies for use in future high-performance microprocessor products. These increases were offset by a $35 million reduction in internal research and development costs from 2002 to 2003, primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our PCS products and the absence of the $42 million charge representing amounts paid to IBM in 2002 in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes. We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as credits to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credits to research and development expenses totaled $29.0 million in 2003 and $21.8 million in 2002. Research and development expenses of $816 million in 2002 increased 25 percent compared to $651 million in 2001. This increase was primarily due to an overall increase in research and development efforts directed to our microprocessors. In addition, research and development expenses in 2002 included a $42 million charge for amounts paid to IBM in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes in the fourth quarter of 2002, as well as the reallocation of $30 million from manufacturing resources, previously included in costs of goods sold, to research and development activities for microprocessors. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $587 million in 2003 decreased 12 percent compared to $670 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to decreased cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of $55 million and cost reductions from the 2002 Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $670 million in 2002 increased eight percent compared to $620 million in 2001 primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses associated with the launch of our branding campaign. In December 2002, we began implementing a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry-wide excess inventory. As part of this plan, and as a result of our agreement with IBM to jointly develop future generations of our logic process technology, we ceased logic research and development in the SDC and eliminated most of those related resources, including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the SDC. The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities 25 Table of Contents currently occupied under long-term operating leases through 2013. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs. Pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of $330.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, consisting primarily of $68.8 million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs, an asset impairment charge of $32.5 million relating to a license that has no future use because of its association with discontinued logic development activities, asset impairment charges of $30.6 million resulting from the abandonment of equipment previously used in logic process development and manufacturing activities, anticipated exit costs of $138.9 million almost wholly related to vacating and consolidating our facilities and a charge of $55.5 million resulting from the abandonment of partially completed ERP software and other information technology implementation activities. During 2003, management approved the sale of additional equipment, primarily equipment used in the SDC, that was identified as no longer useful in our operations. As a result, we recorded approximately $11 million of asset impairment charges in the first quarter of 2003, including $3.3 million of charges for decommission costs necessary to complete the sale of the equipment. During 2003, we revised our estimates of the number of positions to be eliminated pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan from 2,000 to 1,800 in response to the additional resources required due to the FASL LLC transaction. As a result, we reversed $8.9 million of the estimated severance and fringe benefit accrual. As of December 28, 2003, 1,736 employees had been terminated pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan resulting in cumulative cash payments of $53 million in severance and employee benefit costs. The remaining accrual of $6.7 million represents the severance benefits cost obligations for individuals whose employments terminated but who elected to defer receipt of severance benefits until 2004 and for employees who were pre-notified in 2003 of their employment terminations, which will occur in 2004. With the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities, net of estimated sublease income that are payable through 2011, we have substantially completed the activities associated with the 2002 Restructuring Plan as of December 28, 2003. As a result of the 2002 Restructuring Plan, we realized overall cost reductions of approximately $150 million in 2003. We also implemented other cost reduction initiatives incremental to the specific expense reductions resulting from the 2002 Restructuring Plan. The following table summarizes activities under the 2002 Restructuring Plan through December 28, 2003: Severanceand employeebenefits Assetimpairment Exit costs Otherrestructuringcharges Total (Thousands) 2002 provision $ 68,770 $ 118,590 $ 138,900 $ 4,315 $ 330,575 Non-cash charges — (118,590 ) — — (118,590 ) Cash charges (14,350 ) — (795 ) — (15,145 ) Accrual at December 29, 2002 54,420 — 138,105 4,315 196,840 2003 Provision — 7,791 3,314 — 11,105 Cash charges (38,816 ) — (20,796 ) (4,300 ) (63,912 ) Non-cash charges — (7,791 ) — — (7,791 ) Non-cash adjustment (8,864 ) — (15 ) (8,879 ) Accrual at December 28, 2003 $ 6,740 $ — $ 120,623 $ — $ 127,363 In 2001, we announced a restructuring plan (the 2001 Restructuring Plan) due to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry and a resulting decline in revenues. We substantially completed our execution of the 26 Table of Contents 2001 Restructuring Plan as of December 28, 2003. During 2003, we reduced the estimated accrual of the facility and equipment decommission costs by $12.2 million based on the most current information available. During 2003, we also realized a recovery of approximately $3.9 million for the excess of the sale price over the estimated fair value of equipment that was determined to be impaired as a result of the 2001 Restructuring Plan. Both amounts were included in restructuring and other special charges, net. As a result of the 2001 Restructuring Plan, we have realized overall cost reductions of $211 million as of December 28, 2003. The following table summarizes activity under the 2001 Restructuring Plan through December 28, 2003: Severanceand employeebenefits Facility andequipmentimpairment Facilities andequipmentdecommissioncosts Otherfacilitiesexit costs Total (Thousands) 2001 provision $ 34,105 $ 39,000 $ 15,500 $ 700 $ 89,305 2001 cash charges (7,483 ) — — (54 ) (7,537 ) 2001 non-cash charges — (39,000 ) — — (39,000 ) Accrual at December 30, 2001 26,622 — 15,500 646 42,768 2002 cash charges (26,622 ) — (445 ) — (27,067 ) Accrual at December 29, 2002 — — 15,055 646 15,701 Non-cash adjustments — — (11,574 ) (646 ) (12,220 ) Cash charges — — (2,485 ) — (2,485 ) Accrual at December 28, 2003 $ — $ — $ 996 $ — $ 996 Interest income and other, net, of approximately $21 million in 2003 decreased 34 percent from $32 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income of $16 million caused by lower cash equivalents and short-term investment balances and $2.3 million in charges in 2003 for other-than-temporary declines in our equity investments. This decrease was offset by a gain of approximately $6 million based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of assets contributed by us to FASL LLC. Fujitsu now owns a 40 percent interest in these assets. The gain on the deemed sale of these assets to FASL LLC was limited to the difference in carrying value of our interest in the assets following the completion of the transaction and the carrying value of the assets immediately prior to the transaction. Interest income and other, net, of $32 million increased $6 million or 23 percent in 2002 compared to $26 million in 2001. The increase was primarily due to $4.7 million in charges for other-than-temporary declines in our equity investments as compared to $27 million in charges in 2001, offset by a decrease of $20 million in interest income as a result of lower interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest expense of $110 million in 2003 increased 55 percent compared to $71 million in 2002. The increase was due primarily to the effect of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (4.50% Notes), issued in November 2002, which resulted in annual interest charges of $18 million, interest of $5 million on $110 million drawn at the end of September 2002 under our July 2003 Loan Agreement, and the FASL LLC transaction, which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately $9 million in 2003. In addition, in 2002 we capitalized interest of $10.7 million on continued expansion and facilitization of Fabs 25 and 30 compared to only $1.5 million in 2003. Interest expense of $71 million in 2002 increased 16 percent compared to $61 million in 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effect of interest expense incurred on our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 (4.75% Debentures), issued in January 2002, which resulted in interest charges of $22 million, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with conversion of Fab 25 to a Flash memory facility, facilitization activities at Fab 30, and a decrease of $11 million in interest expense due to a partial repayment of the outstanding loans under the Dresden Loan Agreements in 2002. 27 Table of Contents We recorded an income tax provision of $3 million in 2003, an income tax provision of $45 million in 2002 and an income tax benefit of $14 million in 2001. The income tax provision in 2003 primarily reflected income tax expense generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, offset by a benefit of a U.S. federal tax refund from a carryback claim we filed in 2003. No net tax benefit was recorded in 2003 on pre-tax losses due to continuing operating losses. Our tax provision for 2003 does not reflect an increase in our net deferred tax liability of approximately $46 million. This net deferred tax liability was recognized by the Japanese subsidiary of FASL LLC, FASL JAPAN, as tax expense in periods prior to our consolidation of FASL LLC on June 30, 2003, and therefore has not been recorded as a component of our tax expense for 2003. The 2002 income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions. No tax benefit was recorded in 2002 on pre-tax losses due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against the remainder of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of U.S. deferred tax liabilities in the fourth quarter, due to the incurrence of continuing substantial operating losses in the U.S. The effective benefit rate of 15.4 percent for 2001 was less than the statutory rate because of a lower than U.S. statutory 24 percent tax benefit rate on the 2001 restructuring charges, reflecting the allocation of the charges between the U.S. and foreign lower-taxed jurisdictions, and a provision for U.S. taxes on certain previously undistributed earnings of lower-taxed foreign subsidiaries. Other Items International sales as a percent of net sales were 80 percent in 2003, compared to 73 percent in 2002 and 67 percent in 2001. During 2003, approximately 15 percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen, as compared to one percent during 2002. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of FASL LLC’s results of operations, which include sales by FASL LLC to Fujitsu, which are denominated in yen. Our foreign exchange risk exposure resulting from these sales is partially mitigated as a result of our yen-denominated manufacturing costs. In addition, we are subject to foreign currency risk related to our manufacturing costs in Fab 30, which are denominated in euros. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to the euro, but future exchange rate fluctuations may cause increases or decreases to our Fab 30 manufacturing costs. The impact on our operating results from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not been material, principally as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Comparison of Operating Income (Loss) The following is a summary of operating income (loss) for 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Computation Products $ (23 ) $ (661 ) $ (191 ) Memory Products (189 ) (159 ) 268 All Other (21 ) (405 ) (135 ) Total $ (233 ) $ (1,225 ) $ (58 ) Computation Products operating loss of $23 million in 2003 improved by $638 million compared to $661 million in 2002. The improvement was primarily due to incremental net sales of $204 million and a decrease in both manufacturing costs of $330 million and marketing, general and administrative expenses of $39 million, which resulted primarily from our cost reduction initiatives and the 2002 Restructuring Plan. In addition, cooperative advertising and marketing expenses decreased by $55 million from 2002. Computation Products operating loss of $661 million in 2002 increased by $470 million compared to $191 million in 2001 primarily due to a decrease in net sales. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in average selling prices of 13 percent and a decline in unit sales of 16 percent for microprocessors as a result of the sustained downturn in the PC industry. 28 Table of Contents Memory Products operating loss of $189 million in 2003 increased $30 million from 2002. Further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of FASL LLC on June 30, 2003. Memory Products operating loss was $159 million in 2002 compared to $268 million of operating income in 2001. The change in the operating result was primarily due to decrease in net sales of $392 million as a result of a 36 percent decline in average selling prices due to continued weakness in the Flash memory market. Our All Other operating loss of $21 million in 2003 improved by $384 million compared to 2002, primarily due to $331 million of restructuring and other special charges included in the 2002 results, and a $14 million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge in 2003. Our All Other operating loss of $405 million in 2002 increased by $270 million compared to 2001. The operating loss included $331 million of restructuring and other special charges in 2002 compared to approximately $89 million in 2001. The remaining increase of operating loss was primarily due to an increase in operating loss of Personal Connectivity Solutions products, partially offset by approximately $27 million of improvement of operating results in Foundry Services. Financial Condition Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 28, 2003 totaled $1.1 billion, which included approximately $330 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments maintained by FASL LLC. FASL LLC’s operating agreement governs its ability to use this cash balance for operations or to distribute it to us and Fujitsu. Pursuant to the operating agreement, and subject to restrictions contained in third party loan agreements, FASL LLC must first distribute any cash balance to us and Fujitsu in an amount sufficient to cover each party’s estimated tax liability, if any, related to FASL LLC’s taxable income for each fiscal year. Any remaining cash balance after the tax liability distribution would be used by FASL LLC to fund its operations in accordance with its budget. If any cash remains, it must be used to repay FASL LLC’s outstanding debt to us and Fujitsu. Any remaining cash after such distributions is distributed at the discretion of FASL LLC’s Board of Managers, to us and Fujitsu, pro rata, based on each party’s membership interest at the time of distribution, which currently is 60 percent and 40 percent. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $296 million in 2003. Although we had a net loss of $274 million for the year, adjustments for non-cash charges, which were primarily depreciation and amortization, resulted in a positive cash flow from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2003 as compared to 2002 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and the consolidation of FASL LLC’s results of operations, which include FASL LLC’s sales to Fujitsu, and an increase in net inventory due to the consolidation of FASL LLC’s results of operations. At December 28, 2003, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 31 percent of our consolidated net accounts receivable and approximately 13 percent of our consolidated net sales. The net changes in payables and accrued liabilities included payments in 2003 of $90 million for a technology license from IBM, approximately $64 million of payments in 2003 under the 2002 Restructuring Plan and an accrual of $29 million in December 2003 related to our license from IBM for technology and know-how related to manufacturing products on 300-millimeter silicon wafers. Net cash used in operating activities was $120 million in 2002, primarily as a result of our net loss of $1,303 million, adjusted by non-cash related charges. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2002 as compared to 2001 were attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a 31 percent decrease in net sales. At December 29, 2002, inventory increased as compared to December 29, 2001 due to an increase of products to support anticipated 2003 sales, a change in the mix of inventory, and the impact of Flash memory production from Fab 25 following its conversion from logic manufacturing. 29 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities was $168 million in 2001. Although we had a net loss of $61 million, adjustments for non-cash charges resulted in a positive cash flow from operations. These adjustments included: $623 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $82 million of restructuring charges, $27 million of impairment charges on equity investments and $10 million of provision for doubtful accounts, offset by non-cash credits of $98 million from net charges in deferred income taxes and foreign grant and subsidy income, and other uses of cash in operating activities of approximately $423 million due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $83 million in 2003, primarily as a result of net cash inflow of $482 million from sales and purchases of available-for-sale securities, $148 million of cash acquired from the FASL LLC transaction and $30 million in proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment, offset by $570 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $854 million in 2002, including $705 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment primarily for Fab 30 and Fab 25, $27 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Alchemy Semiconductor, Inc., and $131 million from net purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by $9 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $554 million in 2001, primarily due to $679 million used for the purchases of property, plant, and equipment, primarily for Fab 30 and our assembly and test facilities in Asia, and $122 million for additional equity investments in the Manufacturing Joint Venture, offset by $246 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $267 million in 2003, primarily due to $245 million received from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by FASL LLC, a $40 million cash note to FASL LLC from Fujitsu as part of the FASL LLC transaction, $155 million of capital investment allowances received from the Federal Republic of Germany as part of the Fab 30 project and $35 million of proceeds from sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and employee stock option exercises, offset by $141 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and a $74 million increase in a compensating cash balance. The compensating cash balance represents the minimum cash balance that must be maintained by AMD Saxony in order to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant set forth in the Dresden Loan Agreements. Net cash provided by financing activities was $907 million in 2002, primarily due to $486 million in proceeds, net of $14 million in debt issuance costs, from issuing our 4.75% Debentures, $391 million in proceeds, net of $11 million in debt issuance costs, from issuing our 4.50% Notes, $108 million drawn pursuant to the September 2002 Term Loan Agreement (currently referred to as the July 2003 FASL Term Loan), net of $2 million in debt issuance costs, $120 million drawn pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement dated July 13, 1999 (currently referred to as the July 2003 Loan Agreement), $21 million in proceeds from equipment lease financing, $29 million in proceeds from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and employee stock option exercises, and $76 million of net capital investment allowances and interest subsidies received from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony as part of the Fab 30 project. These amounts were offset by $325 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $141 million in 2001, primarily due to $63 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes payable to banks, $308 million drawn pursuant to the Dresden Loan Agreements, $38 million in capital investment allowances and interest subsidies received from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony as part of the Fab 30 project, and $37 million in proceeds from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and employee stock option exercises, offset by $137 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $77 million used to repurchase our common stock and a $91 million increase in the compensating cash balance discussed above. 30 Table of Contents Notes Payable to Banks On July 7, 2003, we amended and restated our 1999 Loan and Security Agreement with a consortium of banks led by a domestic financial institution (the July 2003 Loan Agreement). We further amended the July 2003 Loan Agreement on October 3, 2003. The July 2003 Loan Agreement currently provides for a secured revolving line of credit of up to $125 million that expires in July 2007. We can borrow, subject to amounts set aside by the lenders, up to 85 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from OEMs and 50 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from distributors. As of December 28, 2003, no amount was outstanding under the July 2003 Loan Agreement. We have to comply, among other things, with the following financial covenants if our net domestic cash (as defined in the July 2003 Loan Agreement) declines below $125 million: • restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock; • maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the July 2003 Loan Agreement) as follows: Measurement Date Amount December 31, 2003 $1.25 billion Last day of each calendar quarter in 2004 $1.425 billion Last day of each calendar quarter in 2005 $1.85 billion March 31, 2006 and on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter $2.0 billion • achieve EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) according to the following schedule: Period Amount Four fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2003 $400 million Four fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2004 $550 million Four fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2004 $750 million Four fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2004 $850 million Four fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2004 $950 million Four fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2005 and on each fiscal quarter thereafter $1,050 million As of December 28, 2003, net domestic cash, as defined, totaled $567 million and the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. Our obligations under the July 2003 Loan Agreement are secured by all of our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (excluding intellectual property) and the related proceeds, excluding FASL LLC’s accounts receivable, inventory, and general intangibles. Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees The following tables summarize our principal contractual cash obligations that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and principal guarantees of such indebtedness at December 28, 2003, and are supplemented by the discussion following the tables. 31 Table of Contents Principal contractual cash obligations that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 28, 2003 were: Payments due by period Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 andbeyond (Thousands) 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 $ 500,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 500,000 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 402,500 — — — 402,500 — — Dresden Term Loan 664,056 37,307 335,759 290,990 — — — July 2003 FASL Term Loan 72,500 27,500 27,500 17,500 — — — FASL JAPAN Term Loan 167,926 44,780 44,780 44,780 33,586 — — Fujitsu cash note 40,000 — 10,000 30,000 — — — Capital lease obligations 245,958 83,680 84,022 74,228 3,899 129 — Other long-term liabilities 116,091 — 33,911 15,262 15,555 16,123 35,240 Total Principal Contractual Cash Obligations $ 2,209,031 $ 193,267 $ 535,972 $ 472,760 $ 455,540 $ 16,252 $ 535,240 Guarantees of Indebtedness Recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 28, 2003 related to underlying liabilities that are already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 28, 2003 and their expected expiration dates by year: Amounts of guarantee expiration per period AmountsGuaranteed* 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 andBeyond (Thousands) Dresden intercompany guarantee $ 332,028 $ 18,653 $ 167,880 $ 145,495 $ — $ — $ — July 2003 FASL Term Loan guarantee 43,500 16,500 16,500 10,500 — — — FASL JAPAN Term Loan guarantee 100,756 26,868 26,868 26,868 20,152 — — FASL capital lease guarantees 147,303 53,655 49,494 40,422 3,732 — — Total guarantees $ 623,587 $ 115,676 $ 260,742 $ 223,285 $ 23,884 $ — $ — * Represent the principal amount of the underlying obligations guaranteed and are exclusive of obligations for interest, fees and expenses. 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 On January 29, 2002, we issued $500 million of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 (the 4.75% Debentures) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The interest rate payable on the 4.75% Debentures will reset on August 1, 2008, August 1, 2011 and August 1, 2016 to a rate per annum equal to the interest rate payable 120 days prior to the reset dates on 5-year U.S. Treasury Notes, plus 43 basis points. The interest rate will not be less than 4.75 percent and will not exceed 6.75 percent. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.75% Debentures on February 1, 2009, February 1, 2012, and February 1, 2017. The holders of the 4.75% Debentures also have the ability to require us to repurchase the 4.75% Debentures in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 4.75% Debentures are convertible by the holders into our common stock at a conversion price of $23.38 per share at any 32 Table of Contents time. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures will be convertible into approximately 43 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $14 million are amortized ratably, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the 4.75% Debentures, as interest expense. Beginning on February 5, 2005, the 4.75% Debentures are redeemable by us for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest at our option, provided that we may not redeem the 4.75% Debentures prior to February 5, 2006, unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 130 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price aspercentage ofprincipal amount Beginning on February 5, 2005 through February 4, 2006 102.375 % Beginning on February 5, 2006 through February 4, 2007 101.583 % Beginning on February 5, 2007 through February 4, 2008 100.792 % Beginning on February 5, 2008 100.000 % We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our bonds with cash, stock or assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries when we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 On November 25, 2002, we sold $402.5 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) in a registered offering. Interest on the 4.50% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2003. Beginning on December 4, 2005, the 4.50% Notes are redeemable by us at our option for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest provided that we may not redeem the 4.50% Notes unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 150 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price aspercentage ofprincipal amount Beginning on December 4, 2005 through November 30, 2006 101.8 % Beginning on December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007 100.9 % On December 1, 2007 100.0 % The 4.50% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2007, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $7.37 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Notes will be convertible into approximately 135 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $12 million are amortized ratably, over the term of the 4.50% Notes, as interest expense, approximating the effective interest method. 33 Table of Contents Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.50% Notes in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.50% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Dresden Term Loan and Dresden Term Loan Guarantee AMD Saxony, our indirect, wholly owned German subsidiary, continues to facilitize Fab 30, which began production in the second quarter of 2000. AMD, the Federal Republic of Germany, the State of Saxony and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project. We currently estimate that the construction and facilitization costs of Fab 30 will be $2.5 billion when it is fully equipped by the end of 2005. As of December 28, 2003, we had invested $2.3 billion in AMD Saxony and we currently estimate that during 2004 we will invest approximately $160 million. In March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into a loan agreement and other related agreements (the Dresden Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, in order to finance the project. AMD Saxony has pledged substantially all of its property as security under the Dresden Loan Agreements. The Dresden Loan Agreements were amended in February 2004 to accommodate the construction, facilitization, and operation of Fab 36. Because most of the amounts under the Dresden Loan Agreements are denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros), the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate that was permanently fixed on January 1, 1999, of 1.95583 deutsche marks to one euro for the conversion of deutsche marks to euros, and then used exchange rate as of December 28, 2003, of 0.804 euro to one U.S. dollar to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks into U.S. dollars. The Dresden Loan Agreements, as amended, provide for the funding of the construction and facilitization of Fab 30. The funding consists of: • equity contributions, subordinated and revolving loans and loan guarantees from, and full cost reimbursement through, AMD; • loans from a consortium of banks; and • investment grants, investment allowances, interest subsidies, and loan guarantees from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony. The Dresden Loan Agreements require that we partially fund Fab 30 project costs in the form of subordinated and revolving loans to, or equity investments in, AMD Saxony. In accordance with the terms of the Dresden Loan Agreements, as of December 28, 2003 we had provided $179 million of subordinated loans and $286 million of equity investments in AMD Saxony. These amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. In addition to support from us, the consortium of banks referred to above made available $954 million in loans to AMD Saxony to help fund Fab 30 project costs. The loans have been fully drawn and a portion has been repaid. AMD Saxony had $664 million of such loans outstanding as of December 28, 2003, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. Finally, pursuant to a Subsidy Agreement, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony are supporting the Fab 30 project, in accordance with the Dresden Loan Agreements, in the form of: • guarantees equal to 65 percent of AMD Saxony bank debt, or $432 million; • capital investment grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $453 million; and • interest subsidies totaling $191 million. 34 Table of Contents Of these amounts, AMD Saxony received approximately $412 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $131 million in interest subsidies. In addition, AMD Saxony has received advance payments for interest subsidies amounting to $22 million as of December 28, 2003. AMD Saxony also received $55 million in research and development subsidies through December 28, 2003. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long-term liability on our financial statements and are being amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses through December of 2008. Historical exchange rates in effect at the time these investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies were received were used to translate amounts denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros) into U.S. dollars. Under the Subsidy Agreement, for the construction and financing of Fab 30, AMD Saxony undertook to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2003 and to maintain such headcount until December 2008. Noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies contained in the Subsidy Agreement could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. In December 2002, AMD Saxony reduced its anticipated employment levels as a result of the 2002 Restructuring Plan. Consequently, as of December 2003, headcount was below the level agreed to by AMD Saxony at which AMD Saxony would be entitled to receive the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available. However, the aggregate amount of grants and allowances actually received by AMD Saxony to date, calculated as a percentage of the maximum amount of grants and allowances available, does not exceed the actual headcount at AMD Saxony at December 2003, calculated as a percentage of the headcount target undertaken in the Subsidy Agreement. Accordingly, AMD Saxony does not believe it has received grants and allowances in excess of its entitlement under the Subsidy Agreement. However, we anticipate that the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available under the Subsidy Agreement will be reduced from an originally anticipated amount of $517 million to approximately $453 million. We adjusted the quarterly amortization of these amounts accordingly. The Dresden Loan Agreements, as amended, also require that we: • provide interim funding to AMD Saxony if either the remaining capital investment grants and allowances or the remaining interest subsidies are delayed, such funding to be repaid to AMD, as AMD Saxony receives the investment grants and allowances or subsidies from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany; • fund shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any default under the Subsidy Agreement caused by AMD Saxony or its affiliates; and • guarantee of up to 50 percent of AMD Saxony’s obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements, which guarantee must not be less than $138 million or more than $373 million, until the bank loans are repaid in full. As of December 28, 2003, the amount outstanding under the guarantee was $332 million. As AMD Saxony’s obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements are included in our consolidated financial statements, no incremental liability is recorded under the Dresden guarantee. AMD Saxony would be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements if we, AMD Saxony or AMD Saxony Holding GmbH (AMD Holding) fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if, after the occurrence of the event, the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is materially adversely affected. Circumstances that could result in a default include: • our failure to fund equity contributions or loans or otherwise comply with our obligations relating to the Dresden Loan Agreements; • the sale of shares in AMD Saxony or AMD Holding; • the failure to pay material obligations; 35 Table of Contents • the occurrence of a material adverse change or filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Saxony or AMD Holding; • the occurrence of a default under the July 2003 Loan Agreement; and • AMD Saxony’s noncompliance with certain financial covenants, including minimum tangible net worth, minimum interest cover ratio, asset cover ratio and a minimum liquidity covenant. Generally, any default with respect to borrowings made or guaranteed by AMD that results in recourse to us of more than $2.5 million, and that is not cured by us, would result in a cross-default under the Dresden Loan Agreements. As of December 28, 2003, we were in compliance with all conditions of the Dresden Loan Agreements. In the event we are unable to meet our obligations to AMD Saxony as required under the Dresden Loan Agreements and the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is materially adversely affected, we will be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements, which would permit acceleration of the outstanding loans of approximately $664 million. The occurrence of a default under these agreements would likely result in a cross-default under the Indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and 4.50% Notes. We cannot assure that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. July 2003 FASL Term Loan and Guarantee On July 11, 2003, we amended our September 2002 Loan Agreement and assigned it to FASL LLC. Under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (the July 2003 FASL Term Loan), amounts borrowed bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.14 percent at December 28, 2003. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal and interest installments ending in September 2006. As of December 28, 2003, $72.5 million was outstanding under the July 2003 FASL Term Loan, of which 60 percent is guaranteed by us and 40 percent is guaranteed by Fujitsu. FASL LLC has granted a security interest in certain property, plant and equipment as security under the July 2003 FASL Term Loan. The July 2003 FASL Term Loan Agreement restricts FASL LLC’s ability to pay cash dividends in respect of membership interests if FASL LLC’s net domestic cash balance (as defined in the July 2003 FASL Term Loan) declines below $130 million through the first quarter of 2004, $120 million from the second quarter of 2004 to the end of 2005 and $100 million during 2006. FASL LLC must also comply with additional financial covenants if its net domestic cash balance declines below $130 million through the first quarter of 2004, $120 million from the second quarter of 2004 to the end of 2005 and $100 million during 2006. At any time that net domestic cash falls below these thresholds, FASL LLC must comply with, among other things, the following financial covenants: • maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the July 2003 FASL Term Loan) of not less than $850 million; • achieve EBITDA according to the following schedule: Period Amount For the six months ending December 2003 $75 million For the nine months ending March 2004 $170 million For the four quarters ending June 2004 $285 million For the four quarters ending September 2004 $475 million For the four quarters ending December 2004 $550 million For the four quarters ending in 2005 $640 million For the four quarters ending in 2006 $800 million 36 Table of Contents • maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the July 2003 FASL Term Loan) according to the following schedule: Period Ratio Fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 0.2 to 1.00 First fiscal quarter of 2004 0.25 to 1.00 Period ending June 2004 0.4 to 1.00 Period ending September 2004 0.8 to 1.00 Period ending December 2004 1.0 to 1.00 Full fiscal year 2005 1.0 to 1.00 Full fiscal year 2006 0.9 to 1.00 At December 28, 2003, FASL LLC’s net domestic cash totaled $208 million, and the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. FASL JAPAN Term Loan and Guarantee Because most amounts under the FASL JAPAN Term Loan are denominated in yen, the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate as of December 28, 2003 of 107.19 yen to one U.S. dollar to translate the amounts denominated in yen into U.S. dollars. As a result of the FASL LLC transaction, the Manufacturing Joint Venture’s third-party loans were refinanced from the proceeds of a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 18 billion yen (approximately $168 million on December 28, 2003) entered into between FASL JAPAN and a Japanese financial institution. Under the agreement, the amounts borrowed bear an interest rate of TIBOR plus a spread that is determined by Fujitsu’s current debt rating and FASL JAPAN’s non-consolidated net asset value as of the last day of its fiscal year. The interest rate was 0.98 percent as of December 28, 2003. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal installments ending in June 2007. FASL JAPAN’s assets are pledged as security for its borrowings under this agreement. Also, Fujitsu guaranteed 100 percent of the amounts outstanding under this facility. We agreed to reimburse Fujitsu 60 percent of any amount paid by Fujitsu under its guarantee of this loan. Under this loan agreement, FASL JAPAN is required to comply with the following financial covenants: • Ensure that assets exceed liabilities as of the end of each fiscal year and each six-month period during such fiscal year; • Maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the loan agreement), as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of not less than 60 billion yen; • Maintain total net income plus depreciation, as of the last day of each fiscal period, as follows: Period Amount Fiscal year 2003 $78 million First fiscal quarter of 2004 $23 million First and second fiscal quarters of 2004 $68 million Fiscal year 2004 $214 million Fiscal year 2005 $197 million Fiscal year 2006 $182 million 37 Table of Contents • Ensure that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of (a) net income plus depreciation to (b) the sum of (i) interest expense for such period plus (ii) scheduled amortization of debt for borrowed money (as defined in the loan agreement) for such period, including lease rentals plus (iii) maintenance capital expenditures for FASL JAPAN’s existing and after acquired real property and improvements at its manufacturing facilities located in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, is not less than: Period Percentage First through Fourth Fiscal Quarters of 2003 90 % First Fiscal Quarter of 2004 100 % Second Fiscal Quarter of 2004 110 % Third and Fourth Fiscal Quarters of 2004 120 % Fiscal Year 2005 120 % Fiscal Year 2006 120 % As of December 28, 2003, FASL JAPAN was in compliance with these financial covenants. Fujitsu Cash Note As a result of the FASL LLC transaction, Fujitsu also loaned $40 million to FASL LLC pursuant to a promissory note. The note bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.14 percent as of December 28, 2003, and has a term of three years. The note is repayable in four equal payments, including interest, on September 30, 2005, December 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Capital Lease Obligations On July 16, 2003, FASL JAPAN entered into a sale-leaseback transaction for certain equipment with a third-party financial institution in the amount of 12 billion yen (approximately $100 million on July 16, 2003) in cash proceeds. Upon execution of the agreement, the equipment had a net book value of approximately $168 million. As the term on the leaseback transaction is more than 75 percent of the remaining economic lives of the equipment, we are accounting for the transaction as a capital lease. We recognized an immediate loss of $16 million on the transaction due to the fact that the fair market value of the equipment was less than its net book value at the time of the transaction. We also recorded a deferred loss of approximately $52 million which is being amortized over the term of the lease in proportion to the amortization of the underlying leased assets. We guaranteed 50 percent of the outstanding obligations, under the lease arrangement. As of December 28, 2003, the outstanding lease obligations under this agreement were approximately $86 million. In addition, FASL LLC and its subsidiaries also entered into other capital lease and leaseback transactions during the third quarter of 2003, which resulted in additional capital lease obligations of $159 million as of December 28, 2003. Accordingly, as of December 28, 2003, FASL LLC had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of approximately $245 million. Obligations under these lease agreements are collateralized by the assets leased and are payable through 2007. Leased assets consist principally of machinery and equipment. We guaranteed approximately $147 million of FASL LLC’s aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations as of December 28, 2003. Other Long-term Liabilities Included in other long-term liabilities as of December 28, 2003 is approximately $99 million of restructuring accrual that will be paid through 2011 and approximately $18 million in customer cash deposits related to multi-year supply agreements for Spansion Flash memory products that will be paid through 2005, which guarantee customers’ purchases of these products. Excluded from contractual cash obligations is approximately $263 million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the Fab 30 project and a $23 million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our corporate marketing, general and administrative facility in Sunnyvale, California in 1998, as these liabilities do not require cash payments. 38 Table of Contents Principal contractual cash obligations that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 28, 2003 were: Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 andbeyond (In Thousands) Operating leases $ 466,846 $ 74,288 $ 61,096 $ 47,969 $ 40,340 $ 39,967 $ 203,186 Unconditional purchase commitments 630,136 480,109 98,301 27,239 19,154 2,710 2,623 Total Principal Contractual Cash Obligations $ 1,096,982 $ 554,397 $ 159,397 $ 75,208 $ 59,494 $ 42,677 $ 205,809 Operating Leases and Unconditional Purchase Commitments We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, under lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2018. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future lease obligations as of December 28, 2003, were approximately $467 million, of which $126 million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We enter into purchase commitments for manufacturing supplies and services. Total purchase commitments as of December 28, 2003, were approximately $630 million for periods through 2009. In November 2003, we announced our intention to construct and facilitize a 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36. Fab 36 will be owned by a newly created partnership named AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, or AMD Fab 36, and will be located in Dresden, Germany, adjacent to Fab 30. In November 2003, AMD Fab 36 entered into an agreement with a German entity, M+W Zander, pertaining to the design and construction of the manufacturing facility. As of December 28, 2003, AMD Fab 36 is required to make payments to M+W Zander through May 2005 in an aggregate amount of approximately $440 million. The amounts payable under the construction agreement are denominated in euro. We used the exchange rate of 0.804 euro to one U.S. dollar as of December 28, 2003 to translate the amounts into U.S. dollars. As of December 28, 2003, our purchase commitments also included $80 million representing future payments to IBM under our joint development agreement. As IBM’s services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, we expense the payments as incurred. Purchase commitments also included approximately $71 million for software maintenance agreements that require periodic payments through 2007. As a result, we have not recorded any liabilities relating to these agreements. The remaining $39 million primarily consists of purchase agreements for raw materials and office supplies. 39 Table of Contents Guarantees of Indebtedness not Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheets The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 28, 2003 for which the related underlying liabilities are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 28, 2003 and their expected expiration dates: Amounts of guarantee expiration per period AmountsGuaranteed* 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 andBeyond (In Thousands) FASL LLC operating lease guarantees $ 26,604 $ 12,279 $ 8,367 $ 5,958 $ — $ — $ — AMTC payment guarantee 39,793 — — — 39,793 — — AMTC term loan guarantee 31,088 31,088 — — — — — AMTC rental guarantee 145,811 — — — — — 145,811 ** Total guarantee $ 243,296 $ 43,367 $ 8,367 $ 5,958 $ 39,793 $ — $ 145,811 * Amounts guaranteed represent the principal amount of the underlying obligations and are exclusive of obligations for interest, fees and expenses. ** Amounts outstanding will diminish until the expiration of the guarantee. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the guarantees because they were issued prior to the effective date of FIN 45. FASL LLC Operating Lease Guarantees We guaranteed certain operating leases entered into by FASL LLC and its subsidiaries totaling approximately $27 million as of December 28, 2003. The amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by FASL LLC over the lease terms. AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co., KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by us, Infineon Technologies AG and DuPont Photomasks, Inc. for the purpose of constructing and operating a new advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. To finance the project, BAC and AMTC entered into a $149 million revolving credit facility and a $93 million term loan in December 2002. Also in December 2002, in order to occupy the photomask facility, AMTC entered into a rental agreement with BAC. With regard to these commitments by BAC and AMTC, we guaranteed up to approximately $31 million plus interest and expenses under the term loan, up to approximately $40 million plus interest and expenses under the revolving loan, and up to approximately $17 million, initially, under the rental agreement. The obligations under the rental agreement guarantee diminish over time through 2011 as the term loan is repaid. However, under certain circumstances of default by the other tenant of the photomask facility under its rental agreement with BAC and certain circumstances of default by more than one joint venture partner under its rental agreement guarantee obligations, the maximum potential amount of our obligations under the rental agreement guarantee is approximately $146 million. As of December 28, 2003, $73 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility, and $81 million was drawn under the term loan. These borrowings are subject to the aforementioned guarantees except that our guarantee obligations with respect to the term loan terminated in February 2004 because the AMTC occupied the photomask facility under the rental agreement during 2003 and the rental guarantee replaced the term loan guarantee. Other Financial Matters Fab 36. A significant amount of the costs of the Fab 36 project are denominated in euro. We used the exchange rate of 0.804 euro to one U.S. dollar as of December 28, 2003 to translate the amounts set forth below into U.S. dollars. We expect that over the next four years capital expenditures for Fab 36 will be approximately 40 Table of Contents $2.5 billion, of which approximately $600 million will occur in 2004. In connection with the Fab 36 project, we expect to obtain external financing of approximately $870 million in the form of loans from a consortium of banks, and up to approximately $675 million in grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony. We also expect to obtain financing of approximately $398 million from the State of Saxony, through an investment entity, and a group of European investors led by the project engineer and general contractor, M+W Zander. We will provide the balance of the funding to construct and facilitize Fab 36. In addition, upon the execution of final documentation, which we expect will occur in the first half of 2004, we will be required to guarantee 100 percent of the obligations of AMD Fab 36 under the loan agreements with the banks and to fund any shortfalls in government grants and allowances. As of December 28, 2003, we have invested approximately $25 million in exchange for our equity interest in AMD Fab 36. FASL LLC. During the four-year period commencing on June 30, 2003, we are obligated to provide FASL LLC with additional funding to finance operations shortfalls, if any. Generally, FASL LLC is first required to seek any required financing from external sources. However, if such third-party financing is not available, we must provide funding to FASL LLC equal to our pro-rata ownership interest in FASL LLC, which is currently 60 percent. At this time, we believe that FASL LLC would be able to obtain such external financing when needed. However, there is no assurance that this will happen and currently we cannot estimate the amount of such additional funding, if any, that we are required to provide during this four-year period. Outlook In general, as we look ahead to 2004, we are encouraged by a recovering economy and positive projections for the semiconductor industry. During 2004 we expect to take advantage of additional cost efficiencies from our FASL LLC integration and from FASL LLC’s conversion to 110-nanometer manufacturing process technology on certain of its products and our conversion to 90-nanometer manufacturing process technology for our microprocessor products. During the first quarter of 2004, for our Computation Products segment, we expect net sales to decline slightly in accordance with industry seasonal patterns. For our Memory Products segment, notwithstanding typical seasonal patterns, we expect net sales to be approximately flat for the quarter due to our position in the market and improving average selling prices, which we expect will be driven by increased average bit densities in the products sold and increased shipments of products based on MirrorBit technology. In the aggregate, we believe seasonal patterns will prevail and aggregate net sales will decline slightly in the first quarter of 2004. We expect our capital investments in 2004 to increase in comparison with 2003. We plan to make capital investments of approximately $1.5 billion during 2004, including Fab 36 construction and some equipment purchases, equipment purchases for FASL LLC’s wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities and to complete the transition to 90-nanometer manufacturing process technology at Fab 30. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.2 billion for 2004. We believe that we will be profitable for fiscal 2004 and that gross margins will improve in comparison to 2003. However, economic and industry conditions remain uncertain and continue to make it particularly difficult to forecast product demand. If economic conditions do not continue to improve in the near term in accordance with our expectations, or if the semiconductor industry experiences a significant downturn, our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected. We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances, together with external financing will be sufficient to fund operations and capital investments in the short term. Should additional funding be required such as to meet payment obligations of our long term debts when due, or to finance the construction and facilitization of Fab 36, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. Such funding may be obtained through bank borrowings or from the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration 41 Table of Contents statement; through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933; or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We believe, that in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in quantities or on terms favorable to us. Supplementary Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Disclosures Section I. Option Program Description Our stock option programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. We have several stock option plans under which key employees have been granted incentive (ISOs) and nonqualified (NSOs) stock options to purchase our common stock. Generally, options vest and become exercisable over a four year period from the date of grant and expire five to ten years after the date of grant. ISOs granted under the plans have exercise prices of not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Exercise prices of NSOs range from $0.01 to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Section II.

(3) The “listed officers” are those executive officers listed in the summary compensation table in our proxy statements for our annual meeting of stockholders held in 2004, 2003 and 2002. On June 27, 2003, we filed a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC and made an offer, which was approved by our stockholders, to exchange certain stock options to purchase shares of our common stock, outstanding under eligible option plans and held by eligible employees, for replacement options to be granted no sooner than six months and one day from the cancellation of the surrendered options. The offer to exchange expired on July 25, 2003. Options to purchase approximately 19 million shares of our common stock were tendered for exchange and cancelled on July 28, 2003. On January 30, 2004, we granted options to purchase 12,111,371 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $14.86, which represented the closing price of our common stock on that date, in exchange for options cancelled. On that date, we also granted additional options to purchase 25,165 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $15.55 to employees of one of our foreign subsidiaries in exchange for options cancelled. We did not record compensation expense as a result of the exchange. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46). Variable interest entities are often created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) (FIN 46R) which replaces FIN 46. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on identifying them and assessing an enterprise’s interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46R applies at different dates to different types of enterprises and entities, and special provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied FIN 46 prior to issuance of FIN 46R. Generally, application of FIN 46R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46 or FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Risk Factors We must achieve further market acceptance for our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors, or we will be materially adversely affected. We introduced our AMD Opteron processors in April 2003, and we 43 Table of Contents introduced our AMD Athlon 64 processors in September 2003. We designed these processors to provide users with the ability to take advantage of 64-bit applications while preserving their ability to run existing 32-bit applications on servers and workstations and on desktop and mobile PCs. The success of these processors is subject to risks and uncertainties including: • market acceptance of our new 64-bit technology, AMD64, including the willingness of users to purchase products with 64-bit capability prior to having transitioned to 64-bit computing; • our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner on new process technologies, including 90-nanometer silicon-on-insulator technology, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; • our ability to successfully transition to 90-nanometer manufacturing process technology on a timely basis; • the availability, performance and feature set of motherboards and chipsets designed for these processors; and • the support of operating system and application program providers for our 64-bit instruction set, including timely development of 64-bit applications. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments for research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to improve the technologies and equipment used to fabricate our products. In December 2002 we executed an agreement with IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies, particularly 65- and 45-nanometer technologies to be implemented on 300-millimeter silicon wafers, for use in producing future high-performance microprocessor products. The successful and timely development and implementation of silicon-on-insulator technology and the achievement of other milestones set forth in this agreement are critical to our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors and to our ability to commence operations at Fab 36 in accordance with our planned schedule. During 2002 and 2003, we paid approximately $190 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to research and development activities. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, or obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to fabricate future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive or that our partnerships will be successful. We have experienced substantial fluctuations in revenues since 2001, and we may experience declines in revenues and increases in operating losses in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and our future financial results are anticipated to be, subject to substantial fluctuations. Our total revenues were $3,519 million for 2003 and $2,697 million for 2002 compared to $3,892 million for 2001. The decline from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to a decrease in unit sales and in average selling prices for our Computation Products, resulting from the industry-wide weakness in PC sales, and a decrease in average selling prices for our Memory Products, reflecting continued weakness in the telecommunications and networking equipment industries, and the execution of our plan to align our microprocessor inventory in the supply chain with forecasted demand, which included our decision, primarily in the third and fourth quarters of 2002, to limit shipments and to accept receipt of product returns from certain customers. We incurred a net loss of $274 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003, and $1.3 billion for 2002, compared to a net loss of $61 million for 2001. If conditions do not continue to improve in the microprocessor or Flash memory markets in accordance with our expectations we may experience declines in revenue and operating losses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that, if we do, we will be able to sustain it. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has until recently been in a severe downturn that adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business. The highly cyclical semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles, manufacturing overcapacity and declines in general economic conditions. The most recent downturn, which began in the fourth 44 Table of Contents quarter of 2000, was severe and prolonged, and future downturns may also be severe and prolonged. Our financial performance has been negatively affected by these downturns, including the incurrence of substantial losses during the most recent downturn, as a result of: • the cyclical nature of the supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; • a decline in demand for end-user products that incorporate our semiconductors; • excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including our customers; • excess production capacity; and • accelerated declines in average selling prices. If conditions do not continue to improve in the near term in accordance with our expectations, or if these conditions in the semiconductor industry occur in the future, as they likely will to a lesser or greater degree, our business will be adversely affected. Fluctuations in the personal computer market may continue to materially adversely affect us. The Computation Products segment of our business is dependent upon the PC market. Industry-wide fluctuations in the PC marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Depending on the growth rate of PCs sold, sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease. If end user demand for PCs is below our expectations, we may be adversely affected. In addition, current trends of consolidation within the personal computer industry, as evidenced by the Hewlett-Packard/Compaq merger, as well as potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from Intel Corporation, such as Dell, Inc., could further materially adversely affect us. We plan for significant capital expenditures in 2004, and if we cannot generate the capital required for these capital expenditures and other ongoing operating expenses through operating cash flow and external financing activities, we may be materially adversely affected. We plan for capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion in 2004. Our ability to fund these expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, including third-party loans and investments for the Fab 36 project and third-party financing for FASL LLC’s expansion plans. Our capital expenditures for 2004 include approximately $600 million for the Fab 36 project and approximately $160 million for the Fab 30 project. In addition, FASL LLC expects to spend approximately $583 million in connection with its plans to increase the manufacturing capacity of its wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities and for other research and development activities. During the four-year period commencing on June 30, 2003, we are also obligated to provide FASL LLC with additional funding to finance operational cash flow needs. Generally, FASL LLC is first required to seek any required financing from external sources. However, if such third-party financing is not available, we must provide funding to FASL LLC equal to our pro-rata ownership interest in FASL LLC, which is currently 60 percent. In addition, a significant amount of the costs of the Fab 36 project are denominated in euro. When we initially forecasted our budget for the Fab 36 project, we modeled certain financial assumptions, including that the foreign exchange rate, over time, would be one euro to one U.S. dollar. Since our initial forecast, the U.S. dollar has depreciated against the euro. If the U.S. dollar continues to depreciate against the euro, the costs of the Fab 36 project would be higher than we planned, which could have a material adverse effect on us. These capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and will decrease our cash balances. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors. We regularly assess markets for external 45 Table of Contents financing opportunities, including debt and equity. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain needed debt and/or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon planned projects or curtail capital expenditures. If we abandon projects such as the Fab 36 project, we may have to write off related costs that we capitalized and we may be required to continue to make payments or otherwise be liable pursuant to then-existing contracts that we cannot terminate at will or without significant penalties, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We have a substantial amount of debt and debt service obligations, and may incur additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness. We have a substantial amount of debt and we may incur additional debt in the future. At December 28, 2003, our total debt was $2.1 billion and stockholders’ equity was $2.4 billion. In addition, at December 28, 2003, we had up to $125 million of availability under our July 2003 Loan Agreement (subject to our borrowing base). We had also guaranteed approximately $243 million of debt, which is not reflected as debt on our balance sheet. Our high degree of leverage may: • limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; • require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; • limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and • increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt or our guarantees of other parties’ debts will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt, or meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are not successful in integrating the operations of FASL LLC, we could be materially adversely affected. Effective June 30, 2003, we and Fujitsu Limited executed several agreements that resulted in the integration of our and Fujitsu’s Flash memory operations. We contributed Flash memory inventory, Fab 25 in Austin, Texas, the SDC, and our Flash memory assembly and test operations in Thailand, Malaysia and China. Fujitsu contributed its Flash memory division, including related inventory, cash, and its Flash memory assembly and test operations in Malaysia. In addition, both we and Fujitsu contributed our respective investments in our previous Manufacturing Joint Venture, Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited, located in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of FASL LLC. Our anticipated benefits from this transaction are subject to, among other things, the following risks: • the possibility that FASL LLC will not be successful because of problems integrating the operations and employees of the two companies or achieving the efficiencies and other advantages intended by the transaction; and 46 Table of Contents • the possibility that global business and economic conditions will worsen, resulting in lower than currently expected demand for Flash memory products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate these operations or that we will be able to achieve and sustain any benefit from FASL LLC’s creation. Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market, its position in the Flash memory market and its business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in desktop and mobile PCs for many years. Intel is also a significant competitor in the server segment of the microprocessor market and in the Flash memory market. Because of its dominant position, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intel’s competitors. In addition, Intel’s significant financial resources allow it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel also exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the “Intel Inside” brand program and other marketing programs. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by its: • pricing and allocation strategies and actions; • product mix and introduction schedules; • product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; • exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; • control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers; and • user brand loyalty. Intel also dominates the PC system platform. As a result, PC OEMs are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. In marketing our microprocessors to OEMs we depend on third-party companies other than Intel for the design and manufacture of core-logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and other components. In recent years, many of these third-party designers and manufacturers have lost significant market share to Intel or exited the business. In addition, these companies produce chipsets, motherboards, BIOS software and other components to support each new generation of Intel’s microprocessors, and Intel has significant leverage over their business opportunities. We do not currently plan to develop microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with Intel microprocessors because our patent-cross license agreement with Intel does not extend to microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with Intel’s six and subsequent generation processors. Thus, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. Our ability to compete with Intel in the market for microprocessors will depend on our ability to develop relationships with infrastructure providers and ensure that these third-party designers and manufacturers design PC platforms to support new generations of our microprocessors. A failure of the designers and producers of motherboards, chipsets and other system components to support our microprocessor offerings, particularly our new AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Opteron microprocessors, would have a material adverse effect on us. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market as well as to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do. We expect competition from Intel to increase in 2004 and beyond to the 47 Table of Contents extent Intel reduces prices for its products and as Intel introduces new competitive products. For example, in February 2004, Intel announced that it intends to introduce 64-bit processors for servers and workstations that will be able to run existing 32-bit software applications in mid-2004. We believe that these processors will compete with our AMD Opteron microprocessors. In addition, Intel announced that it will offer 64-bit processors for the desktop market and other market segments that will be able to run existing 32-bit software applications in a time frame based on both timing and availability of the infrastructure required to support them, and customer demand. These products would compete with our AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology. Use of 90-nanometer technology can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and that cost less to manufacture. Use of 300-millimeter wafers can decrease manufacturing costs and increase capacity by yielding more equivalent chips per wafer than 200-millimeter wafers. We have not yet made comparable transitions at our microprocessor manufacturing facilities. As a result, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intel’s strong position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could adversely affect our revenues. If we are unable to develop, produce and successfully market higher-performing microprocessor products, we may be materially adversely affected. The microprocessor market is characterized by short product life cycles and migration to ever-higher performance microprocessors. To compete successfully, we must transition to new process technologies at a fast pace and offer higher-performance microprocessors in significantly greater volumes at competitive prices. If we fail to achieve yield and volume goals or to offer higher-performance microprocessors in significant volume on a timely basis and at competitive prices, we could be materially adversely affected. To be successful, we must increase sales of our x86 microprocessor products to existing customers and develop new customers in both consumer and commercial markets, particularly the latter. Our production and sales plans for microprocessors are subject to other risks and uncertainties, including: • market acceptance for the AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors, which rely on market acceptance and demand for our AMD64 technology; • our ability to fund our planned 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility and develop associated process technologies that will be required for long-term competitiveness; • our ability to increase our share of the enterprise market with tier-one OEM customers in order to have the demand necessary to utilize the capacity of our planned 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility; • our ability to successfully market the AMD Athlon XP, AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Duron processors, which rely in part on market acceptance of a metric based on overall processor performance versus processor clock speed (measured in megahertz frequency); • the pace at which we expect to be able to convert production in Fab 30 to 90-nanometer process technology; • our ability to maintain adequate selling prices of microprocessors despite increasingly aggressive Intel pricing strategies, marketing programs, new product introductions and product bundlings of microprocessors, motherboards and chipsets; • our ability, on a timely basis, to produce microprocessors in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; • our ability to attract and retain engineering and design talent; • our ability to expand system design capabilities; and • the availability and acceptance of motherboards and chipsets designed for our microprocessors. 48 Table of Contents Our ability to increase microprocessor product revenues and benefit fully from the substantial investments we have made and continue to make related to microprocessors depends on the success of our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 processors and the continuing success of our AMD Athlon XP and AMD Duron microprocessors. If we fail to achieve continued and expanded market acceptance of our microprocessors, we may be materially adversely affected. If we were to lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products, our ability to market our processors would be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends on Microsoft’s designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets, including our AMD64 technology introduced with our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 processors, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our microprocessors. If we fail to retain the support of Microsoft, our ability to market our processors could be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer for our Spansion Flash memory products in the high-end mobile telephone market, or a lack of market acceptance of FASL LLC’s MirrorBit technology may have a material adverse effect on us. Since the third quarter of 2002, our Flash memory product sales growth was almost entirely based on strength in the high-end mobile phone market. To date, our sales in that market have been concentrated with a few customers. In addition, we expect competition in the market for Flash memory devices to continue to increase as new competitors enter the Flash memory market, particularly the NOR segment, existing competing manufacturers introduce new products or pursue aggressive pricing strategies and industry-wide production capacity increases. We may be unable to maintain or increase our market share in Flash memory devices as the market develops and other competitors introduce new competing products. A decline in unit sales of our Flash memory devices, lower average selling prices, a downturn in the mobile phone market or a loss of a significant mobile phone customer, would have a material adverse effect on us. In July 2002, we commenced production shipments of the first product with MirrorBit technology. MirrorBit technology is a memory cell architecture that enables Flash memory products to hold twice as much data as standard Flash memory devices. A lack of customer or market acceptance, or any substantial difficulty in transitioning Flash memory products, including those based on MirrorBit technology, to any future process technology could reduce FASL LLC’s ability to be competitive in the market and could have a material adverse effect on us. Spansion Flash memory products are based on the NOR architecture, and a significant market shift to the NAND architecture could materially adversely affect us. Spansion Flash memory products are based on the Boolean logic-based NOR (Not Or) architecture, which is typically used for code execution. FASL LLC does not manufacture products based on NAND (Not And) architecture, which typically offers greater storage capacity. During 2003, sales of products based on NAND architecture have grown at higher rates than sales of NOR products. This has resulted in the NAND vendors gaining a greater share of the overall Flash market. Any significant shift in the marketplace to products based on NAND architecture or other architectures may reduce the total market available to us and therefore reduce our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may affect demand for our products and slow payment by our customers. The recent economic slowdown in the United States and worldwide, exacerbated by the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and consequences of sustained military action in the Middle East, adversely affected demand for our products. Although economic conditions began to improve in the second half of 2003, another decline of the worldwide semiconductor market or a future decline in economic conditions in any significant geographic area would likely decrease the overall demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If the economic slowdown returns as a result of terrorist activities, military action or otherwise, it could adversely impact our customers’ ability to pay us in a timely manner. 49 Table of Contents Manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may adversely affect us. There may be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with others, could have a material adverse effect on us. If we do not transition to 90-nanometer manufacturing process technology at Fab 30 on a timely basis, we may not be able to meet the demand for certain of our microprocessor products. In addition, FASL LLC’s manufacturing facilities may be inadequate to meet our demand for certain Flash memory products. As a result, FASL LLC may not be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of these products to allow us to meet demand for these products from our customers. At times we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products. We are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by building Fab 36, transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies and making significant capital investments in Fab 30. In addition, FASL LLC is increasing its manufacturing capacity by transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies, expanding Fab 25, JV1, JV2, and JV3 and increasing the capacity of its assembly and test facilities to accommodate both a growth in units that transition to higher densities and an increase in MCP products. If the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations, we and FASL LLC may underutilize manufacturing facilities, and we could be materially adversely affected. This has in the past had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow. We believe that at this time, the most significant risk is manufacturing capacity constraint. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. We and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance, and decrease costs. During 2004, we plan to transition our microprocessor production to 90-nanometer process technology, and FASL LLC intends to transition the production of certain of its memory products to 110-nanometer process technology. During periods when we or FASL LLC are implementing new process technologies, our or FASL LLC’s manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. Substantial delay in the technology transitions in Fab 30 to smaller process technologies employing silicon-on-insulator technology and in FASL LLC’s wafer fabrication facilities to smaller geometries could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do. For example, Intel currently manufactures certain microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology. Use of 90-nanometer technology can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and that cost less to manufacture. Use of 300-millimeter wafers can decrease manufacturing costs and increase capacity by yielding more equivalent chips per wafer than 200-millimeter wafers. We have not yet made comparable transitions at our microprocessor manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. We may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, delays in meeting the milestones set forth in our joint development agreement with IBM, upgrading or expanding existing facilities, or changing our process technologies, which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. External factors, such as the SARS virus, bird flu and potential terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, may materially adversely affect us. In early 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus 50 Table of Contents had an adverse effect upon the Asian economies and affected demand for our products in Asia. A new outbreak of the virus, or a new virus such as the recent bird flu virus, could have a similar impact on demand for our products in Asia. In addition, if there were to be a case of SARS discovered in any of our operations in Asia, the measures to prevent the spread of the virus could disrupt our operations at that location. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations directly or indirectly and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, and ultimately affect our sales. Also as a result of terrorism, the United States may be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales, our supply chain and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition, and also may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future prices of our securities. Intense competition in the integrated circuit industry may materially adversely affect us. The integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive. Products compete on performance, quality, reliability, price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, marketing and distribution capability, brand recognition, and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, competitors enter the market, and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. Failure to reduce our costs on existing products or to develop and introduce, on a cost-effective and timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products with higher margins, would have a material adverse effect on us. If our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our July 2003 Loan Agreement, as amended, contains restrictive covenants and also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when our net domestic cash is below specified amounts, and the Dresden Loan Agreements impose restrictive covenants on AMD Saxony, including a restriction on its ability to pay dividends. The July 2003 FASL Term Loan contains restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on FASL LLC’s ability to pay dividends and also requires FASL LLC to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when its net domestic cash is below specified amounts. Our ability to satisfy the covenants, financial ratios and tests of our debt instruments, and FASL LLC’s ability to satisfy the covenants, financial ratios and tests of the July 2003 FASL Term Loan, can be affected by events beyond our or FASL LLC’s control. We cannot assure you that we or FASL LLC will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under our July 2003 Loan Agreement, the July 2003 FASL Term Loan and/or the Dresden Loan Agreements. In addition, these agreements contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in 51 Table of Contents cross-default under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default under the July 2003 FASL Term Loan would cause a cross-default under the July 2003 Loan Agreement and a default under the July 2003 Loan Agreement or under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and our 4.50% Notes would cause a cross-default under the Dresden Loan Agreements. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we or FASL LLC were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the July 2003 Loan Agreement, the July 2003 FASL Term Loan Agreement and the Dresden Loan Agreements could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have granted a security interest in substantially all of our inventory and accounts receivable under our July 2003 Loan Agreement, FASL LLC has granted a security interest in certain property, plant and equipment as security under the July 2003 FASL Term Loan Agreement, and AMD Saxony has pledged substantially all of its property as security under the Dresden Loan Agreements. If the lenders under any of the credit facilities or the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and our 4.50% Notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. One or more of our products may be found to be defective after the product has been shipped to customers in volume. The cost of a recall, software fix, product replacements and/or product returns may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, modifications needed to fix the defect may impede performance of the product. If essential raw materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Certain raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products and FASL LLC uses in the manufacture of its products are available from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we are dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a few foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages we purchase. Similarly, FASL LLC purchases commercial non-Flash memory die, such as SRAM, from third party suppliers and incorporates these die into its MCP products. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we or FASL LLC are unable to procure certain of these materials, we or FASL LLC might have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on us. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products are performed at our manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, and Singapore; or by subcontractors in the United States and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of Spansion products are performed at FASL LLC’s facilities in Malaysia, Thailand, and China. We manufacture our microprocessors in Germany. We also depend on foreign foundry suppliers for the production of our Personal Connectivity Solutions and chipset products, international joint ventures for the manufacture of optical photomasks that we intend to use in the manufacture of our microprocessors, and we have international sales operations. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include: • expropriation; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • difficulty in protecting our intellectual property; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls; • changes in freight and interest rates; • disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and • loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; 52 Table of Contents Any of the above risks, should they occur, could have a material adverse effect on us. As part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in emerging overseas markets. Expansion into emerging overseas markets presents similar political and economic risks as described above, and we may be unsuccessful in our strategy to penetrate these emerging overseas markets. Also, a significant portion of the manufacturing costs for our microprocessor products is denominated in euros while sales of those products are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. If the U.S. dollar continues to depreciate against the euro in the foreign exchange market, our gross margins may deteriorate. Our inability to continue to attract and retain key personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous key engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be otherwise materially adversely affected. Our inability to effectively implement new modules of our enterprise resource planning system could have a material adverse effect on us. In November 2003, we restarted the implementation of the sales and distribution modules of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that we initially began implementing in early 2002 and postponed from September 2002 to November 2003 as part of our cost-cutting initiatives. The ERP system is intended to provide an integrated information system to serve all of AMD. We are heavily dependent on the proper function of our internal systems to conduct our business. System failure or malfunctioning may result in disruption of operations and the inability to process transactions. If we encounter unforeseen problems with regard to system operations or these additional module implementations, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the semiconductor industry does not continue to improve in accordance with our expectations or undergoes another downturn or if demand for our products is lower than our expectations, we may again postpone implementation of these modules. We rely on third parties to provide supply-chain logistics functions, including physical distribution of our products, and some information technology services. We rely on a third-party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for Fab 25 and the SDC. In addition, we rely on a third-party provider in India to provide certain information technology services to us, including helpdesk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access. Our relationships with these providers is governed by fixed term contracts. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations, the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for Fab 25 and the SDC may be adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we decided to co-source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and create a more variable cost structure for the company. However, if the costs related to administration, communication and coordination of these third-party providers are greater than we expect, then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings. Our operating results are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, our revenues are generally higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter of each year. This seasonal pattern is largely a result of decreased demand in Europe during the summer months and higher demand in the retail sector of the PC market during the winter holiday season. In recent quarters, a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have been made in the last month of the quarter. 53 Table of Contents Uncertainties involving the ordering, and shipment of, and payment for our products could materially adversely affect us. Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and we generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory. While we believe inventories in the supply chain are currently at reasonable levels, market conditions are uncertain and these and other factors could materially adversely affect our revenues. Our price-protection obligations and return rights under specific provisions in our agreements with distributors may adversely affect us. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as products that are slow moving or have been discontinued. These agreements, which may be canceled by either party on a specified notice, generally allow for the return of our products. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re-sold by the distributors. The price protection and return rights we offer to our distributors could materially adversely affect us if distributors exercise these rights as a result of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products or otherwise. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property, in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We may not be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property, in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent. Despite our efforts to protect our rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to cost-effectively monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that all necessary licenses can be obtained on satisfactory terms, if at all. We could decide, in the alternative, to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others will always be avoided or successfully concluded. Failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing process, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us or FASL LLC to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment, to modify product designs or to incur other expenses associated with compliance with environmental regulations. Any failure to control the use of, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future litigation proceedings may materially affect us. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. 54 Table of Contents Any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages. In addition, future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our corporate headquarters in California and FASL LLC’s manufacturing facilities in Japan are located in earthquake zones and these operations could be interrupted in the event of an earthquake. Our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in California and FASL LLC’s wafer fabrication facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines in Japan. In the event of a major earthquake, we and FASL LLC could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and/or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect us. The conversion of our outstanding 4.50% Notes could have a significant negative impact on our earnings per share and the market price of our common stock. On November 25, 2002, we sold $402.5 million of our 4.50% Notes in a registered offering. The 4.50% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2007, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $7.37 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Notes will be convertible into approximately 135 shares of our common stock, for an aggregate potential issuance of approximately 54 million additional shares. On March 1, 2004, the closing price of our common stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange was $14.89. If the holders of our 4.50% Notes elect to convert all or some of their notes into common stock, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In order to reduce this interest rate risk, we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities. As of December 28, 2003, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short-term investments and consisted primarily of bank notes, short-term corporate notes, short-term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short-term federal agency notes. The majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term. We continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate. We do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.

We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures in our foreign sales subsidiaries and AMD Saxony and for foreign currency denominated fixed-asset purchase commitments. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We had an aggregate of $421 million (notional amount) of short-term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in Japanese yen and European Union euro outstanding as of December 28, 2003. Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 28, 2003 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. 56 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2004, which are included in this annual report. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Overview We design, manufacture and market industry-standard digital ICs that are used in diverse product applications such as desktop and mobile PCs, workstations, servers, communications equipment such as mobile phones and automotive and consumer electronics. Our products consist primarily of microprocessors and Flash memory devices. We also sell embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and other consumer markets. In 2004, we continued to focus on customer-centric innovation by developing microprocessor and Flash memory products that assist our customers in adding functionality and enhancing the performance of their products. We continued to design and develop microprocessor products based on AMD64 technology, which allow our customers to protect their existing investments by continuing to use their 32-bit software applications while transitioning to a 64-bit platform. As of December 26, 2004, sales of AMD64-based processors represented approximately one-half of our net sales for the Computation Products segment. In Flash memory, we continued to manufacture products based on our MirrorBit technology, which we believe will enable our customers to cost effectively include next-generation applications, such as high-resolution cameras and streaming video, on their mobile phone. We also introduced floating gate memory products manufactured on 110-nanometer technology and substantially completed the integration of our and Fujitsu’s Flash memory operations in Spansion. We also continued to devote resources to develop advanced manufacturing process technologies. During 2004, we successfully transitioned to smaller manufacturing geometries for both our microprocessor and Flash memory products. As of December 26, 2004, we were manufacturing our microprocessor products using primarily 90-nanometer technology and we were manufacturing our highest density and performance Flash memory products on 110-nanometer floating gate and MirrorBit technology. In 2004, despite a net loss in the fourth quarter, we returned to a full year of profitability. Total net sales for 2004 of $5.0 billion increased 42 percent compared with net sales of $3.5 billion for 2003. This increase was driven primarily by increased sales of microprocessors and Flash memory products across all geographies as well as the effects of consolidating Spansion’s results of operations, which include sales by Spansion to Fujitsu, for the twelve months in 2004 as compared to six months in 2003. Our transition to smaller manufacturing process geometries for both our microprocessor and Flash memory products contributed to lower manufacturing costs per unit and higher overall gross margins, which, along with increased net sales, contributed to a net income of $91 million in 2004 compared to a net loss of $274 million in 2003. We also substantially completed the construction of Fab 36, our 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany and we are currently in the process of installing equipment. We believe the new capacity provided by this facility, which we expect to be in volume production in 2006, will allow us to satisfy anticipated demand for our microprocessors. However, in 2004, the cyclical Flash memory market posed unique challenges for us. In the second half of 2004, Memory Products net sales decreased by $259 million, compared to the first half of 2004. Factors that 20 Table of Contents contributed to this decline included aggressive pricing by competitors and an imbalance in the supply and demand for Flash memory products. In addition, decreased demand from the wireless handset market in Asia, in part due to channel inventory accumulation by wireless handset OEMs in China, contributed to a decline in Memory Products net sales during the third quarter of 2004. The down-turn in the overall Flash memory market, lower than expected sales in Japan and a delay in our qualification of a Flash memory product for the wireless category contributed to lower Memory Products net sales during the fourth quarter of 2004. For 2005, we believe critical success factors include: continuing to increase market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, particularly in the enterprise segment; taking products based on our second-generation MirrorBit technology to market and effectively ramping such products to mass production on a timely basis; strengthening our relationships with key customers and establishing relationships with new customers that are industry leaders in their markets; successfully developing and continuing to transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies for both our microprocessor and Flash memory products; developing and introducing new microprocessor products for the mobile, server and workstation markets, including dual-core processors, on a timely basis and increasing our share of those markets; developing and introducing new Flash memory products on a timely basis; controlling costs; increasing the adoption of MirrorBit technology; and expanding our participation in high-growth global markets, including China, Latin America, India and Eastern Europe. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted United States accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenues, inventories, asset impairments, restructuring charges and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales and a provision for estimated future price reductions in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near-term factory production planning. Inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand of generally six months or less, are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other 21 Table of Contents factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. To the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins, we would disclose them in our filings with the SEC. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset’s carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. Restructuring Charges. We record and account for our restructuring activities following formally approved plans that identify the actions and timeline over which the restructuring activities will occur. Our remaining restructuring accruals include estimates pertaining to facility exit costs and subleasing assumptions resulting from exiting certain facilities. We review these accruals on a quarterly basis and adjust these accruals when changes in facts and circumstances suggest actual amounts will differ from our estimates. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual costs may be different than our original or revised estimates. These changes in estimates can result in increases or decreases to our results of operations in future periods and would be presented on the restructuring and other special charges (recoveries), net, line of our consolidated operating statements. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In fiscal 2002, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets at the time. In fiscal 2003, we continued to provide a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. In fiscal 2004, a portion of the valuation allowance was utilized as a result of net operating profits. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed, resulting in a benefit to our earnings. Such benefits would be recorded on the income tax provision (benefit) line of our statement of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing 22 Table of Contents jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. Results Of Operations In March 1993, we and Fujitsu formed Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited, a joint venture for the purpose of manufacturing Flash memory devices. Through the Manufacturing Joint Venture, we and Fujitsu constructed and operated advanced integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan. Effective June 30, 2003, we and Fujitsu executed agreements to integrate our Flash memory operations. The Manufacturing Joint Venture was contributed to a new entity, Spansion LLC, which is owned 60 percent by us and 40 percent by Fujitsu. As a result of this transaction, we began consolidating Spansion’s results of operations on June 30, 2003. Prior to June 30, 2003, we accounted for our share of the Manufacturing Joint Venture’s operating results under the equity method. As Spansion did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of our operations for periods prior to the third quarter of 2003 do not include the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operations. Accordingly, our operating results for the years ended December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003 are not fully comparable with our results for prior periods. Also, because we have a 60 percent controlling interest in Spansion, Fujitsu’s 40 percent share in the net income (loss) of Spansion is reflected as a minority interest adjustment to our consolidated financial statements. This minority interest adjustment does not correspond to operating income (loss) of our Memory Products segment because operating income (loss) for our Memory Products segment includes operations incremental to those of Spansion. In addition, the minority interest calculation is based on Spansion’s net income (loss) rather than operating income (loss). We review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income before interest, taxes and minority interest. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management judgment. Prior to the third quarter of 2003, we had two reportable segments: the Core Products segment, which consisted of the microprocessor, memory products and other IC products operating segments, and the Foundry Services segment, which consisted of fees for products sold to Vantis Corporation, our former programmable logic devices subsidiary, and Legerity Inc., our former voice communication products subsidiary. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, we changed our reportable segments to the Computation Products segment, which includes microprocessor products for desktop and mobile PCs, servers and workstations and chipset products, and the Memory Products segment, which includes Flash memory products. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we began presenting our Personal Connectivity Solutions operating segment as a separate reportable segment because the operating loss from this operating segment exceeded 10 percent of the combined profit of all our operating segments and therefore this operating segment became a reportable segment under the requirements of Statement of Financial Standards 131, “Segment Reporting” (FAS 131). Previously, we included our Personal Connectivity Solutions operating segment in our All Other category. The Personal Connectivity Solutions segment includes primarily low power, high performance x86 and MIPS architecture-based embedded microprocessors. In addition to our three reportable segments, we also have the All Other category, which is not a reportable segment, and which includes certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to the operating segments. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. However, because Spansion did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of operations for periods prior to June 30, 2003 did not include the consolidation of Spansion’s operations. Accordingly, the segment operating information for the Memory Products segment for the year ended December 26, 2004, is not comparable to the reclassified segment information for the prior periods presented. We use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in December. The years ended December 26, 2004, December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, each included 52 weeks. 23 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our net sales and operating income (loss) by segment and category for 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Net sales Computation Products $ 2,528 $ 1,960 $ 1,756 Memory Products 2,342 1,419 741 Personal Connectivity Solutions 131 140 166 All Other — — 34 Total Net Sales $ 5,001 $ 3,519 $ 2,697 Operating income (loss) Computation Products $ 303 $ (23 ) $ (661 ) Memory Products 35 (189 ) (159 ) Personal Connectivity Solutions (72 ) (14 ) (25 ) All Other (44 ) (7 ) (380 ) Total Operating Income (Loss) $ 222 $ (233 ) $ (1,225 ) Computation Products Computation Products net sales of $2.5 billion in 2004 increased 29 percent compared to net sales of $2.0 billion in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 19 percent increase in average selling prices and a nine percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments. The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to increased sales of our higher-priced AMD64-based processors, particularly our AMD Athlon 64 processors, which contributed to a richer product mix. Similarly, the increase in unit shipments reflected the increased demand for these processors. As of December 26, 2004, sales of AMD64-based processors represented approximately one-half of our net sales for the Computation Products segment. Sales increased across all geographic regions, and growth was particularly strong in North America and Asia. Computation Products net sales of $2.0 billion in 2003 increased 12 percent compared to net sales of $1.8 billion in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a 15 percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments due primarily to increased demand from our OEM customers. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline of four percent in the average selling prices. Computation Products operating income of $303 million in 2004 increased by $326 million compared to an operating loss of $23 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 29 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of $79 million in connection with our AMD64-based products, a nine percent increase in unit shipments, and a $28 million increase in research and development costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a $29 million increase in Fab 36 start-up costs and a $24 million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. Computation Products operating loss of $23 million in 2003 improved by $638 million compared to an operating loss of $661 million in 2002. The improvement was primarily due to a 12 percent increase in net sales and a decrease in both manufacturing costs of $330 million and marketing, general and administrative expenses of $39 million, as a result of our cost reduction initiatives and the 2002 Restructuring Plan. In addition, cooperative advertising and marketing expenses decreased by $55 million from 2002. 24 Table of Contents Memory Products Memory Products net sales of $2.3 billion in 2004 increased 65 percent compared to net sales of $1.4 billion in 2003. The increase was primarily due to increased demand for Flash memory products across all geographies, which resulted in a nine percent increase in average selling prices, and the effect of consolidating Spansion’s results of operations, which include Spansion’s sales to Fujitsu of $1.1 billion for 12 months in 2004 compared to $449 million for six months in 2003. In the second half of 2003, demand for Flash memory products began to increase significantly, and this trend continued through the first half of 2004. In the second half of 2004, however, our Memory Products net sales declined due to aggressive pricing by competitors and an imbalance in the supply and demand for Flash memory products. In addition, decreased demand from the wireless handset market in Asia, due in part to channel inventory accumulation by wireless OEMs in China, contributed to a decline in Memory Products net sales during the third quarter. The downturn in the overall Flash memory market, lower than expected sales in Japan and a delay in qualifying a new Flash memory product for the wireless category contributed to lower Memory Products net sales during the fourth quarter. Further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between AMD and Fujitsu. Memory Products net sales of $1.4 billion in 2003 increased 92 percent compared to net sales of $741 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to the effect of consolidating Spansion’s results of operations, which include Spansion’s sales to Fujitsu during the last six months of fiscal 2003 and increased demand for Flash memory products, particularly in the second half of 2003. Further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between AMD and Fujitsu. Memory Products operating income of $35 million increased $224 million from an operating loss of $189 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to the effect of consolidating Spansion’s results of operations, which include Spansion’s sales to Fujitsu, for 12 months in 2004 compared to six months in 2003. In addition, our manufacturing costs decreased due to our transition to 110-nanometer process technology for certain of our Flash memory products in 2004 and as a result of increased shipments of Flash memory products based on MirrorBit technology, which are less expensive to manufacture than Flash memory products based on floating gate technology. Further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansion on June 30, 2003. Memory Products operating loss of $189 million in 2003 increased $30 million from an operating loss of $159 million in 2002. Further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansion on June 30, 2003. Personal Connectivity Solutions Personal Connectivity Solutions (PCS) net sales of $131 million in 2004 decreased seven percent compared to net sales of $140 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a $43 million decrease in sales of certain end-of-life embedded microprocessors, partially offset by a $33 million increase in sales of AMD Geode products. We acquired the Geode product line from National Semiconductor in August 2003. Accordingly, the increase in sales of AMD Geode products in 2004 was due to the fact that in 2004 we had 12 months of sales whereas in 2003 we had approximately four months of sales. PCS net sales of $140 million in 2003 decreased 15 percent compared to net sales of $166 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a $53 million decrease in sales of certain end-of-life embedded microprocessors and networking products, partially offset by a $28 million increase in sales of AMD Geode and wireless products. PCS operating loss of $72 million in 2004 increased compared to an operating loss of $14 million in 2003. The increase in the operating loss was primarily due to a $48 million increase in operating expenses. Operating 25 Table of Contents expenses increased due to an increase of approximately $35 million in manufacturing costs as a result of a change in product mix, and an aggregate increase of $14 million in research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses as a result of activities related to our AMD Geode products and other product development. Manufacturing costs increased primarily because we manufactured more AMD Geode products, which generally are more expensive to manufacture than our other embedded processors. PCS operating loss of $14 million in 2003 improved compared to the operating loss of $25 million in 2002. The improvement was primarily due to sales of $12 million of certain embedded microprocessors and networking products that had been previously written off. All Other Category There were no net sales generated in the All Other category in 2003 or 2004. All Other net sales of zero in 2003 decreased from $34 million in 2002 due to the discontinuation of our Foundry Services in 2002. All Other operating loss of $44 million in 2004 increased from $6 million in 2003, primarily due to an increase of approximately $30 million in corporate bonus and profit sharing expense. In addition, All Other operating loss in 2004 included approximately $5 million of restructuring and other special charges, while in 2003 we had a $14 million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge. All Other operating loss of $6 million in 2003 improved by $374 million compared to an operating loss of $380 million in 2002, primarily due to $331 million of restructuring and other special charges included in the All Other category for 2002, compared to a $14 million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge in 2003. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income and Other, Net, Interest Expense and Taxes The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions except forpercentages) Cost of sales $ 3,033 $ 2,327 $ 2,106 Gross margin 39 % 34 % 22 % Research and development expense $ 935 $ 852 $ 816 Marketing, general and administrative expense 807 587 670 Restructuring and other special charges (recoveries), net 5 (14 ) 331 Interest income and other, net 31 (21 ) (32 ) Interest expense 112 110 71 Income tax provision 6 3 45 Gross margin percentage increased to 39 percent in 2004 compared to 34 percent in 2003. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of 42 percent and lower unit manufacturing costs resulting from our transition to smaller, more cost efficient, manufacturing process technologies for both of our microprocessors and Flash memory products. Further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansion’s operating results as of June 30, 2003. Gross margin percentage increased to 34 percent in 2003 compared to 22 percent in 2002. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of 30 percent, accompanied by an increase in cost of sales of only ten percent. Our cost of sales increased at a lower rate than net sales primarily due to cost reductions from the 2002 Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives. In addition, microprocessor unit sales 26 Table of Contents increased 15 percent while average selling prices of microprocessor products decreased by four percent, and we realized revenues of $63 million, or approximately two gross margin percentage points, from the sale of microprocessor products that had been previously written off. Further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansion’s operating results as of June 30, 2003. We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as a credit to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $67.1 million in 2004, $46.2 million in 2003 and $37.5 million in 2002. Research and development expenses of $935 million in 2004 increased ten percent from $852 million in 2003 due in part to higher research and development expenses as result of the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operation, an increase in start-up costs of approximately $29 million associated with the Fab 36 project and a $24 million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors. These factors were partially offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. Research and development expenses of $852 million in 2003 increased four percent from $816 million in 2002, due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operation, $23 million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors, and $58 million paid to IBM to jointly develop new process technologies for use in future microprocessor products. The increases in research and development expenses were offset by a $35 million reduction in research and development costs, primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our PCS products and the absence of the $42 million charge representing amounts paid to IBM in 2002 in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes. We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as a credit to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $20.7 million in 2004, $29 million in 2003 and $21.8 million in 2002. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $807 million in 2004 increased 37 percent compared to $587 million in 2003, primarily due to increased sales and cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of $112 million primarily associated with our AMD 64-based processors, expenses from Spansion of $153 million for 12 months of 2004 compared to $78 million for six months in 2003 and new regulatory compliance costs of $15 million. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $587 million in 2003 decreased 12 percent compared to $670 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to decreased cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of $55 million and cost reductions from the 2002 Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives. Effects of 2002 Restructuring Plan In December 2002, we began implementing a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry-wide excess inventory. As part of this plan, and as a result of our agreement with IBM to jointly develop future generations of our microprocessor manufacturing process technology, we ceased microprocessor related research and development in the SDC and eliminated most of the related resources, including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the SDC. 27 Table of Contents The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities currently occupied under long-term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs. Pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of $330.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, consisting primarily of $68.8 million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs, an asset impairment charge of $32.5 million relating to a license that has no future use because of its association with discontinued microprocessor development activities, asset impairment charges of $30.6 million resulting from the abandonment of equipment previously used in microprocessor process development and manufacturing activities, anticipated exit costs of $138.9 million almost wholly related to vacating and consolidating our facilities and a charge of $55.5 million resulting from the abandonment of partially completed ERP software and other information technology implementation activities. During 2003, management approved the sale of additional equipment primarily used in the SDC that was identified as no longer useful in our operations. As a result, we recorded approximately $11 million of asset impairment charges in the first quarter of 2003, including $3.3 million of charges for decommission costs necessary to complete the sale of the equipment. During 2003, we also revised our estimates of the number of positions to be eliminated pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan from 2,000 to 1,800 in response to the additional resources required due to the Spansion transaction. As a result, we reversed $8.9 million of the estimated severance and fringe benefit accrual. As of December 26, 2004, 1,786 employees had been terminated pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan resulting in cumulative cash payments of $60 million in severance and employee benefit costs. During 2004, we adjusted the restructuring accrual related to the 2002 Restructuring Plan, which resulted in an additional $5.2 million restructuring charge for the period. The adjustment was primarily related to a change in our estimate of potential sublease opportunities associated with abandoned facilities located in Sunnyvale, California. With the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities net of estimated sublease income that are payable through 2011, we have completed the activities associated with the 2002 Restructuring Plan. With the formation of Spansion and other business changes, we no longer track the overall cost savings from the 2002 Restructuring Plan because we do not believe this information would be useful. 28 Table of Contents The following table summarizes activities under the 2002 Restructuring Plan through December 26, 2004: SeveranceandEmployeeBenefits AssetImpairment Exit andEquipmentDecommissionCosts OtherRestructuringCharges Total (in thousands) 2002 provision $ 68,770 $ 118,590 $ 138,900 $ 4,315 $ 330,575 Non-cash charges — (118,590 ) — — (118,590 ) Cash charges (14,350 ) — (795 ) — (15,145 ) Accruals at December 29, 2002 $ 54,420 — $ 138,105 $ 4,315 $ 196,840 2003 provision — $ 7,791 $ 3,314 — $ 11,105 Cash charges (38,816 ) — (20,796 ) (4,300 ) (63,912 ) Non-cash charges — (7,791 ) — — (7,791 ) Non-cash adjustments (8,864 ) — — (15 ) (8,879 ) Accruals at December 28, 2003 $ 6,740 — $ 120,623 — $ 127,363 Cash charges (6,789 ) (20,150 ) (26,939 ) Non-cash adjustments $ 49 $ 5,203 $ 5,252 Accruals at December 26, 2004 — — $ 105,676 — $ 105,676 Effects of 2001 Restructuring Plan In 2001, in response to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry and a resulting decline in revenues, we implemented a restructuring plan (the 2001 Restructuring Plan). We completed our execution of the 2001 Restructuring Plan as of December 26, 2004. During 2003, we reduced the estimated accrual of the facility and equipment decommission costs by $12.2 million based on the most current information available and we realized a recovery of approximately $3.9 million for the excess of the sale price over the estimated fair value of equipment that we determined was impaired as a result of the 2001 Restructuring Plan. Both amounts were included in restructuring and other special charges (recoveries), net. With the formation of Spansion and other business changes, we no longer track the overall cost savings from this 2001 Restructuring Plan because we do not believe the information would be useful. The following table summarizes activity under the 2001 Restructuring Plan from December 30, 2001 through December 26, 2004: SeveranceandEmployeeBenefits Facilities andEquipmentDecommissionCosts OtherFacilitiesExitCosts Total (in thousands) Accruals at December 30, 2001 $ 26,622 $ 15,500 $ 646 $ 42,768 Cash charges (26,622 ) (445 ) — (27,067 ) Accruals at December 29, 2002 $ — $ 15,055 $ 646 $ 15,701 Non-cash adjustments — (11,574 ) (646 ) (12,220 ) Cash charges — (2,485 ) — (2,485 ) Accruals at December 28, 2003 $ — $ 996 $ — $ 996 Cash charges — (991 ) — (991 ) Non-cash adjustments — (5 ) — (5 ) Accruals at December 26, 2004 $ — $ — $ — $ — 29 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other, Net We recorded a net charge of interest income and other, net of $31 million in 2004 compared to interest income and other, net of approximately $21 million in 2003. This charge was due primarily to a charge of approximately $32 million related to a series of transactions pursuant to which we exchanged $201 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) for our common stock. The charge represented the difference between the fair value of the common stock issued in the transactions and the fair value of common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the 4.50% Notes. In addition, interest income and other, net, in 2004 included a charge of approximately $14 million in connection with our prepayment of the Dresden Term Loan, and a loss of approximately $6 million during the second quarter of 2004 resulting from the mark-to-market of certain foreign currency forward contracts that we used as economic hedges of forecasted capital contributions to AMD Fab 36 KG, which do not qualify as accounting hedges. Interest income and other, net, of approximately $21 million in 2003 decreased 34 percent from $32 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income of $16 million caused by lower cash equivalents and short-term investment balances and a charge of $2.3 million in 2003 for other-than-temporary declines in our equity investments. This decrease was offset by a gain of approximately $6 million based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of assets contributed by us to Spansion. Fujitsu now owns a 40 percent interest in these assets. The gain on the deemed sale of these assets to Spansion was limited to the difference in carrying value of our interest in the assets following the completion of the transaction and the carrying value of the assets immediately prior to the transaction. Interest Expense Interest expense of $112 million in 2004 was flat compared to $110 million in 2003. On October 29, 2004, we sold $600 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 (the 7.75% Notes). Interest accrued on the 7.75% Notes was partially offset by the absence of interest expense, as of November 2, 2004, for amounts outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan, which we prepaid on November 2, 2004, and the absence of interest expense with respect to $201 million of our 4.50% Notes, which we exchanged for our common stock in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of 2004. We also capitalized interest during 2004 of $9 million in connection with our Fab 36 construction activities in Dresden, Germany. Interest expense of $110 million in 2003 increased 55 percent compared to $71 million in 2002. The increase was due primarily to annual interest charges of $18 million on our 4.50% Notes sold in November 2002, $5 million of interest on $110 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and the Spansion transaction, which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately $9 million in 2003. In addition, in 2002 we capitalized interest of $10.7 million on continued expansion and facilitization of Fabs 25 and 30 compared to $1.5 million in 2003. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $6 million in 2004, $3 million in 2003 and $45 million in 2002. The income tax provision in 2004 primarily reflects U.S. income taxes, including taxes on the dividends repatriated from controlled foreign corporations, partially offset by foreign tax benefits because of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2003 primarily reflected income tax expense generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, offset by a benefit of a U.S. federal tax refund from a carryback claim we filed in 2003. The 2002 income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions and the establishment of a valuation allowance against the remainder of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of U.S. deferred tax liabilities in the fourth quarter, due to continuing substantial operating losses in the United States. As of December 26, 2004, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $930 million and $45 million. We also had foreign loss carryforwards of approximately $88 million. We also had 30 Table of Contents federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $246 million and $86 million. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2005 through 2024, if not utilized. We maintain a full valuation allowance against all our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets ($694 million at December 26, 2004) because of our history of recent losses. Other Items International sales as a percent of net sales were 79 percent in 2004, 80 percent in 2003 and 73 percent in 2002. During 2004 and 2003, approximately 22 and 15 percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen, as compared to one percent during 2002. The increase in the percentage in 2004 and 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operations, effective June 30, 2003, which include sales by Spansion to Fujitsu, which are denominated in yen. Our foreign exchange risk exposure resulting from these sales is partially mitigated as a result of our yen-denominated manufacturing costs. In addition, we are subject to foreign currency risk related to our manufacturing costs in Fab 30, which are denominated in euro. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to the euro, but future exchange rate fluctuations may cause increases or decreases to our Fab 30 and Fab 36 manufacturing costs. The impact on our operating results from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not been material, on an annual basis, principally as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk,” below. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 26, 2004 totaled $1.2 billion, which included approximately $196 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of Spansion. Spansion’s operating agreement governs its ability to use this cash for operations or to distribute it to us and Fujitsu. Pursuant to the operating agreement, and subject to restrictions contained in third party loan agreements, Spansion must first distribute any cash balance to us and Fujitsu in an amount sufficient to cover each party’s estimated tax liability, if any, related to Spansion’s taxable income for each fiscal year. Any remaining cash balance after the tax liability distribution would be used by Spansion to fund its operations in accordance with its budget. If any cash remains, it must be used to repay Spansion’s outstanding debt to us and Fujitsu. Any remaining cash may be distributed at the discretion of Spansion’s Board of Managers, to us and Fujitsu, pro rata, based on each party’s membership interest at the time of distribution, which currently is 60 percent and 40 percent. Due to our repayment of amounts outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan on November 2, 2004 and the related termination of the Dresden Loan Agreements effective December 23, 2004, we are no longer required to maintain a compensating cash balance. Therefore, as of December 26, 2004, our compensating cash balance was zero as compared to $218 million as of December 28, 2003. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.1 billion in 2004. Net income of $91 million, non-cash charges, consisting primarily of $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and a $32 million charge associated with our exchange of $201 million of our 4.50% Notes for common stock, contributed to the positive cash flows from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2004 as compared to 2003 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales, and increased inventories due primarily to an increase in microprocessor inventories resulting from a higher percentage of AMD64-based processors and improved market conditions. For fiscal 2004, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 23 percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately 22 percent of our consolidated gross sales. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $296 million in 2003. Although we had a net loss of $274 million for the year, adjustments for non-cash charges, which were primarily depreciation and 31 Table of Contents amortization, resulted in a positive cash flow from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2003 as compared to 2002 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operations, which include Spansion’s sales to Fujitsu, and an increase in net inventory due to the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operations. For fiscal 2003, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 31 percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately 13 percent of our consolidated gross sales. In 2003, the net changes in payables and accrued liabilities primarily included payments of $90 million for a technology license from IBM and approximately $64 million of payments under the 2002 Restructuring Plan. Net cash used in operating activities was $120 million in 2002, primarily as a result of our net loss of $1.3 billion, adjusted by non-cash charges. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2002 as compared to 2001 were attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a 31 percent decrease in net sales. At December 29, 2002, inventory increased as compared to December 29, 2001 due to an increase of products to support anticipated 2003 sales, a change in the mix of inventory, and the impact of Flash memory production from Fab 25 following its conversion from a microprocessor manufacturing facility. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2004, primarily as a result of $1.4 billion used to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $569 million used to construct Fab 36, and a net cash outflow of $150 million from sales and purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by $34 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $83 million in 2003, primarily as a result of net cash proceeds of $482 million from sales and purchases of available-for-sale securities, $148 million of cash acquired in conjunction with the Spansion transaction and $30 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, offset by $570 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $854 million in 2002, including $705 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment primarily for Fab 30 and Fab 25, $27 million, net of cash acquired, used to acquire Alchemy Semiconductor, and $131 million from net purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by $9 million of proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $413 million in 2004. This amount included $745 million of proceeds from financing activities, including $588 million in proceeds, net of $13 million in debt issuance costs, from the issuance of our 7.75% Notes, approximately $250 million in investments from the non-affiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, $60 million of proceeds from equipment sale and leaseback transactions, $30 million of capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project, $124 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options and the elimination of our $224 million compensating cash balance due to the prepayment of our Dresden Term Loan. These amounts were offset by $898 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, including approximately $647.2 million used to prepay amounts outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan, including accrued and unpaid interest. Net cash provided by financing activities was $267 million in 2003, primarily due to $245 million received from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by Spansion, a $40 million cash note to Spansion from Fujitsu as part of the Spansion transaction, $155 million of capital investment allowances received from the Federal Republic of Germany for the Fab 30 project and $35 million of proceeds from issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options, offset by $141 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and a $74 million increase in our compensating cash balance, which represented the minimum cash balance that AMD Saxony was required to maintain in order to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant set forth in the Dresden Term Loan. 32 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $907 million in 2002, primarily due to $486 million in proceeds, net of $14 million in debt issuance costs, from the issuance of our 4.75% Debentures, $391 million in proceeds, net of $11 million in debt issuance costs, from the issuance of our 4.50% Notes, $108 million drawn under the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs, $120 million drawn under our revolving credit facility, $21 million in proceeds from equipment lease financings, $29 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options, and $76 million of net capital investment allowances and interest subsidies received from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony for the Fab 30 project. These amounts were offset by payments of $325 million on debt and capital lease obligations. Liquidity We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances, together with currently available credit facilities (see “Revolving Credit Facilities,” below) and external financing, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital investments in the short term and long term. We also believe that we have sufficient financing arrangements in place to fund the estimated $2.5 billion required to facilitize Fab 36. See “Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements,” below. Should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debts when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. Such funding may be obtained through bank borrowings, or from issuances of additional debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement; through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933; or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in quantities or on terms favorable to us. Revolving Credit Facilities AMD Revolving Credit Facility Our revolving credit facility provides for a secured revolving line of credit of up to $100 million that expires in July 2007. We can borrow, subject to amounts set aside by the lenders, up to 85 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from OEMs and 50 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from distributors. As of December 26, 2004, no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility, we have to comply, among other things, with the following financial covenants if our net domestic cash (as defined in our revolving credit facility) declines below $125 million: • restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock; • maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in our revolving credit facility) as follows: Measurement Date Amount (in millions) Last day of each fiscal quarter in 2004 $ 1,425 Last day of each fiscal quarter in 2005 $ 1,850 Last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter $ 2,000 33 Table of Contents • achieve EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) according to the following schedule: Period Amount (in millions) Four fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2004 $ 950 Four fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2005 and four fiscal quarters ending each fiscal quarter thereafter $ 1,050 As of December 26, 2004, net domestic cash, as defined, totaled $831 million and the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured by all of our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (excluding intellectual property) and the related proceeds, excluding Spansion’s accounts receivable, inventory and general intangibles. Spansion Japan Revolving Loan Agreement In March 2004, Spansion Japan Limited, a subsidiary of Spansion, entered into a revolving credit facility agreement with certain Japanese financial institutions in the aggregate amount of 15 billion yen (approximately $145 million as of December 26, 2004). Spansion Japan can draw under the facility until March 24, 2005. The revolving facility consists of two tranches: tranche A in the aggregate amount of up to nine billion yen (approximately $87 million as of December 26, 2004) and tranche B in the aggregate amount of up to six billion yen (approximately $58 million as of December 26, 2004). However, as described in more detail below, the total amount that Spansion Japan can draw is limited based on the value of Spansion Japan’s accounts receivable from Fujitsu, which are pledged as security to the lenders. As of December 26, 2004, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. Amounts borrowed under tranche A bear interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 0.55 percent. Amounts borrowed under tranche B bear interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.2 percent. Spansion Japan must first fully draw under tranche A prior to drawing amounts under tranche B. Borrowings must be used for working capital purposes and must be repaid no later than April 24, 2005. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement, Spansion Japan is required to comply with the following financial covenants: • ensure that assets exceed liabilities as of the end of each fiscal year and each six-month (mid-year) period; • maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the agreement) at an amount not less than 60 billion yen (approximately $579 million as of December 26, 2004) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; • maintain total net income plus depreciation of $213 million as of the last day of fiscal year 2004; and • ensure that as of the last day of each of the third and fourth quarter of 2004, the ratio of (a) net income plus depreciation to (b) the sum of interest expenses plus the amount of scheduled debt repayments plus capital expenditures for its facilities located in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, for such period, is not less than 120%. As of December 26, 2004, Spansion Japan was in compliance with these financial covenants. As security for amounts outstanding under the revolving facility, Spansion Japan pledged its accounts receivable from Fujitsu. The accounts receivable are held in trust pursuant to the terms of a trust agreement. Under the trust agreement, Spansion Japan is required to maintain the value of its accounts receivable at specified thresholds (as defined by the trust agreement), based upon the amounts outstanding under tranche A and tranche B. In addition, the trustee collects payments from Fujitsu into a separate trust account and releases these amounts to Spansion Japan, subject to the calculated thresholds, upon instruction from the agent for the lenders. At any 34 Table of Contents time when the accounts receivable balance in the trust account is less than the required thresholds, Spansion Japan is required to do one of the following to cure the shortfall: • provide additional cash to the trust; or • repay a specified portion of the outstanding loans. Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility may become automatically due and payable upon the occurrence of specified events with respect to Spansion Japan, including: filings or proceedings in bankruptcy, failure to pay any obligations under the revolving credit facility that have become due, failure to pay other third-party indebtedness where such debt exceeds 200 million yen (approximately $2 million as of December 26, 2004), or if the value of the accounts receivable from Fujitsu held in trust is below the required thresholds and such shortfall is not remedied within three business days. In addition, amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility may become automatically due and payable upon the occurrence of specified events with respect to Fujitsu including: filings or proceedings in bankruptcy, default by Fujitsu with respect to payments to Spansion Japan or other obligations under their purchase and sale agreement, or default by Fujitsu with respect to other third-party indebtedness where such debt exceeds one billion yen (approximately $10 million as of December 26, 2004). As of December 26, 2004, the amount of accounts receivable held in the trust was approximately $166 million. Because most amounts under the Spansion Japan Revolving Loan are denominated in yen, the dollar amounts stated above are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate as of December 26, 2004 of 103.62 yen to one U.S. dollar to translate the amounts denominated in yen into U.S. dollars. Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees The following table summarizes our principal contractual cash obligations at December 26, 2004, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table. Principal contractual cash obligations at December 26, 2004 were: Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 andbeyond (in thousands) 4.75% Debentures $ 500,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 500,000 4.50% Notes 201,500 — — 201,500 — — — 7.75% Notes 600,000 — — — — — 600,000 Repurchase Obligations to Fab 36 Partners (1) 121,931 16,242 26,422 26,422 26,422 26,423 — July 2003 Spansion Term Loan 44,599 27,500 17,099 — — — — Spansion Japan Term Loan 127,389 46,323 46,323 34,743 — — — Fujitsu Cash Note 40,000 10,000 30,000 — — — — AMD Penang Term Loan 6,325 1,518 1,518 1,518 1,518 253 — Spansion China Loan 32,499 32,499 — — — — — Capital Lease Obligations 184,853 96,746 83,079 4,816 212 — — Operating Leases 430,854 76,865 63,812 51,007 44,547 39,071 155,552 Unconditional Purchase Commitments (2)(3) 1,281,200 281,662 205,951 209,301 183,774 43,074 357,438 Total principal contractual cash obligations $ 3,571,150 $ 589,355 $ 474,204 $ 529,307 $ 256,473 $ 108,821 $ 1,612,990 35 Table of Contents (1) This is the amount of silent partnership contributions received by AMD Fab 36 KG as of December 26, 2004 from the unaffiliated limited partners under the Fab 36 partnership agreements. Assuming certain milestones are met by AMD Fab 36 KG, we expect to receive a total of up to $189 million of silent partnership contributions. AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are required to repurchase each partner’s silent partnership contribution in annual installments one year after the partner has contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements. As of December 26, 2004, Fab 36 Beteiligungs had contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements, but Leipziger Messe had not contributed the full amount. Therefore, the condition precedent to our repurchase obligations with respect to Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership contribution had not been met. See “Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements,” below. (2) Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (3) We have unconditional purchase commitments for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume or purchase commitment in the table above. 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 On January 29, 2002 we issued $500 million of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2022 (the 4.75% Debentures) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The interest rate payable on the 4.75% Debentures will reset on August 1, 2008, August 1, 2011 and August 1, 2016 to a rate equal to the interest rate payable 120 days prior to the reset dates on 5-year U.S. Treasury Notes, plus 43 basis points. The interest rate will not be less than 4.75 percent and will not exceed 6.75 percent. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.75% Debentures on February 1, 2009, February 1, 2012, and February 1, 2017. The holders of the 4.75% Debentures also have the ability to require us to repurchase the 4.75% Debentures in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 4.75% Debentures are convertible by the holders into our common stock at a conversion price of $23.38 per share at any time. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures will be convertible into approximately 43 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $14 million are amortized ratably, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the 4.75% Debentures, as interest expense. As of February 5, 2005, the 4.75% Debentures are redeemable by us for cash at our option at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that we may not redeem the 4.75% Debentures prior to February 5, 2006, unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 130 percent of the then-effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price as a Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on February 5, 2005 through February 4, 2006 102.375 % Beginning on February 5, 2006 through February 4, 2007 101.583 % Beginning on February 5, 2007 through February 4, 2008 100.792 % Beginning on February 5, 2008 100.000 % We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 4.75% Debentures with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 36 Table of Contents 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 On November 25, 2002, we issued $402.5 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) in a registered offering. Interest on the 4.50% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2003. Beginning on December 4, 2005, the 4.50% Notes are redeemable by us at our option for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that we may not redeem the 4.50% Notes unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 150 percent of the then-effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price as a Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on December 4, 2005 through November 30, 2006 101.800 % Beginning on December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007 100.900 % On December 1, 2007 100.000 % The 4.50% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2007, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $7.37 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Notes will be convertible into approximately 135 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $12 million are amortized ratably, over the term of the 4.50% Notes, as interest expense, approximating the effective interest method. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.50% Notes in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.50% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 26, 2004 we had exchanged an aggregate of $201 million of our 4.50% Notes for 29,391,261 shares of our common stock in a series of transactions. As a result of these transactions, we recognized a charge of approximately $32 million, which represented the difference between the fair value of the shares issued in the transactions and the fair value of shares issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the 4.50% Notes. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remainder of our 4.50% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 On October 29, 2004, we issued $600 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 (the 7.75% Notes) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the 7.75% Notes plus existing cash to prepay the full amount outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan, including accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment premium. See “Repayment of Dresden Term Loan,” below. The 7.75% Notes mature on November 1, 2012. Interest on the 7.75% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, beginning May 1, 2005. Prior to November 1, 2008, we may redeem some or all of the 7.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and 37 Table of Contents unpaid interest plus a “make-whole” premium, as defined in the agreement. Thereafter, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on November 1, 2008 through October 31, 2009 103.875 % Beginning on November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010 101.938 % Beginning on November 1, 2010 through October 31, 2011 100.000 % On November 1, 2011 100.000 % In addition, on or prior to November 1, 2007, we may redeem up to 35 percent of the 7.75% Notes with the proceeds of certain sales of our equity securities at 107.75 percent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 7.75% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.75% Notes at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the 7.75% Notes contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, which include all of our subsidiaries except Spansion and its subsidiaries, from: • incurring additional indebtedness; • paying dividends and making other restricted payments; • making certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; • creating or permitting certain liens; • creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • using the proceeds from sales of assets; • entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidating or merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. We also entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the 7.75% Notes, which granted the holders certain exchange and registration rights with respect to the 7.75% Notes. We agreed to: • file a registration statement within 90 days after October 29, 2004 enabling holders to exchange 7.75% Notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical terms; • use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 180 days after October 29, 2004; • use commercially reasonable efforts to effect an exchange offer of the 7.75% Notes for registered notes within 225 days after October 29, 2004; and • file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the 7.75% Notes if we cannot effect the exchange offer within the time periods listed above. If we do not meet these deadlines, additional interest of 0.25% per instance will be paid on the 7.75% Notes until the obligations under the registration rights agreement are fulfilled. On January 20, 2005 we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 in order to enable holders to exchange the outstanding 7.75% Notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical terms. 38 Table of Contents Issuance costs incurred in connection with this transaction in the amount of approximately $13 million will be amortized ratably over the term of the 7.75% Notes as interest expense, approximating the effective interest method. Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements We are facilitizing our new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36, in Dresden, Germany, which is located adjacent to Fab 30. Fab 36 is owned by a German limited partnership named AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, or AMD Fab 36 KG. We control the management of AMD Fab 36 KG through a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 LLC, which is a general partner of AMD Fab 36 KG. Accordingly, AMD Fab 36 KG is our indirect consolidated subsidiary. We expect that Fab 36 will produce future generations of our microprocessor products, and that it will be in volume production in 2006. AMD, Leipziger Messe GmbH, a nominee of the State of Saxony, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH, an investment consortium arranged by M+W Zander Facility Engineering GmbH, the general contractor for the project, and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are limited partners in AMD Fab 36 KG. We also anticipate receiving up to approximately $735 million in grants and allowances from federal and state German authorities for the Fab 36 project. We expect that capital expenditures for Fab 36 through 2007 will be approximately $2.5 billion in the aggregate. The funding to construct and facilitize Fab 36 consists of: • Equity contributions from us of $792 million under the partnership agreements, revolving loans from us of up to approximately $1.0 billion, and guarantees from us for amounts owed by AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliates to the lenders and unaffiliated limited partners; • investments of up to approximately $433 million from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs; • loans of up to approximately $947 million from a consortium of banks; • up to approximately $735 million of subsidies consisting of grants and allowances, from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony; and • a loan guarantee from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders referenced above after foreclosure on all other security. As of December 26, 2004, we had contributed $248 million of equity in AMD Fab 36 KG and no loans were outstanding. These amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. On April 21, 2004, AMD, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD that owns substantially all of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, and AMD Fab 36 Admin GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD Fab 36 Holding that owns the remainder of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, (collectively referred to as the AMD companies) entered into a series of agreements (the partnership agreements) with the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, relating to the rights and obligations with respect to their limited partner and silent partner contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG. The partnership has been established for an indefinite period of time. A partner may terminate its participation in the partnership by giving twelve months advance notice to the other partners. The termination becomes effective at the end of the year following the year during which the notice is given. However, other than for good cause, a partner’s termination will not be effective before December 31, 2015. Also on April 21, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG entered into a term loan agreement and other related agreements (the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate Fab 36. The consortium of banks agreed to make available up to $947 million in loans to AMD Fab 36 KG upon its achievement of specified milestones, including attainment of “technical completion” at Fab 36, which requires certification by the banks’ 39 Table of Contents technical advisor that AMD Fab 36 KG has a wafer fabrication process suitable for high-volume production of advanced microprocessors and has achieved specified levels of average wafer starts per week and average wafer yields, as well as cumulative capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion. We currently anticipate that AMD Fab 36 KG will attain these milestones and first be able to draw on the loans in 2006. The amounts borrowed under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements are repayable in quarterly installments commencing in September 2007 and terminating in March 2011. AMD Fab 36 KG pledged substantially all of its current and future assets as security under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, we pledged our equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding pledged its equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Admin and its partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG and AMD Fab 36 Admin and AMD Fab 36 LLC pledged all of their partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG. We guaranteed the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. We also guaranteed repayment of grants and allowances by AMD Fab 36 KG, should such repayment be required pursuant to the terms of the subsidies provided by the federal and state German authorities. Pursuant to the terms of the guarantee, we have to comply with specified adjusted tangible net worth and EBITDA financial covenants if the sum of our and our subsidiaries’ cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, less the amount outstanding under any third-party revolving credit facility or term loan agreement with an original maturity date for amounts borrowed of up to one year (group consolidated cash), declines below the following amounts: Amount (in thousands) if Moody’s Rating is at least if Standard & Poor’s Rating is at least $500,000 B1 or lower and B+ or lower 425,000 Ba3 and BB- 400,000 Ba2 and BB 350,000 Ba1 and BB+ 300,000 Baa3 or better and BBB-or better As of December 26, 2004, group consolidated cash was greater than $500 million, and therefore, the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. The partnership agreements set forth each limited partner’s aggregate capital contribution to AMD Fab 36 KG and the milestones for such contributions. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, AMD, through AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, agreed to provide an aggregate of $792 million, Leipziger Messe agreed to provide an aggregate of $271 million and Fab 36 Beteiligungs agreed to provide an aggregate of $162 million. The capital contributions of Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are comprised of limited partnership contributions and silent partnership contributions. These contributions are due at various dates upon the achievement of milestones relating to the construction and operation of Fab 36. The partnership agreements also specify that the unaffiliated limited partners will receive a guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent per annum on their total investment depending upon the monthly wafer output of Fab 36. We guaranteed these payments by AMD Fab 36 KG. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements and subject to the prior consent of the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin have a call option over the limited partnership interests held by Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, first exercisable three and one-half years after the relevant partner has completed the applicable capital contribution and every three years thereafter. Also, commencing five years after completion of the relevant partner’s capital contribution, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs each have the right to sell their limited partnership interest to third parties (other than competitors), subject to a right of first refusal held by AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, or to put their limited partnership interest to AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The put option is thereafter exercisable every three years. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs also have a put option in the event they are outvoted at AMD Fab 36 KG partners’ meetings with respect to certain specified matters such as increases in the partners’ capital contributions beyond those required by the partnership agreements, investments 40 Table of Contents significantly in excess of the business plan, or certain dispositions of the limited partnership interests of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The purchase price under the put option is the partner’s capital account balance plus accumulated or accrued profits due to such limited partner. The purchase price under the call option is the same amount, plus a premium of $4.7 million to Leipziger Messe and a premium of $2.8 million to Fab 36 Beteiligungs. The right of first refusal price is the lower of the put option price or the price offered by the third party that triggered the right. We guaranteed the payments under the put options. In addition, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are obligated to repurchase the silent partnership interest of Leipziger Messe’s and Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ contributions over time. Specifically, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are required to repurchase Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership interest of $108 million in annual 25 percent installments commencing one year after Leipziger Messe has completed its limited partnership and silent partnership contributions, and Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ silent partnership interest of $81 million in annual 20 percent installments commencing in October 2005. For accounting and financial reporting purposes under United States generally accepted accounting principles, we classified the silent partnership contributions as debt, based on their fair value because of the mandatory redemption features described in the prior paragraph. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this debt towards our ultimate redemption value of the silent partnership contributions by the guaranteed annual rate of return of between 11 percent to 13 percent. We classify this periodic accretion to redemption value as interest expense. The limited partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 KG expects to receive from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are subject to the put and call provisions referenced above. These contributions are not mandatorily redeemable, but rather are subject to redemption outside of the control of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. Upon consolidation, we initially record these contributions as minority interest, based on their fair value. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this minority interest toward our ultimate redemption value of these contributions by the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We classify this periodic accretion of redemption value as an additional minority interest allocation. No separate accounting is required for the put and call options because they are not freestanding instruments and not considered derivatives under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. As of December 26, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG received $122 million of silent partnership contributions and $128 million of limited partnership contributions from the unaffiliated limited partners. These contributions were recorded as debt and minority interest, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In addition to support from us and the consortium of banks referred to above, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony have agreed to support the Fab 36 project in the form of: • a loan guarantee equal to 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders after foreclosure on all other security; and • subsidies consisting of grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $735 million. As of December 26, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG received cash allowances of $5 million for investments made in 2003 and cash grants of $25 million for investments made in 2003 and 2004. The Fab 36 Loan Agreements also require that we: • provide funding to AMD Fab 36 KG if cash shortfalls occur, including funding shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any defaults caused by AMD Fab 36 KG or its affiliates; and • guarantee 100 percent of AMD Fab 36 KG’s obligations under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements until the loans are repaid in full. 41 Table of Contents Under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are generally prevented from paying dividends or making other payments to us. In addition, AMD Fab 36 KG would be in default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements if we or any of the AMD companies fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if, after the occurrence of the event, the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is adversely affected. Circumstances that could result in a default include: • failure of any limited partner to make contributions to AMD Fab 36 KG as required under the partnership agreements or our failure to provide loans to AMD Fab 36 KG as required under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • failure to pay any amount due under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements within five days of the due date; • occurrence of any event which the lenders reasonably believe has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets or condition of AMD Fab 36 KG or AMD or their ability to perform under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Fab 36 KG or any limited partner; • occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) of AMD; • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on payment of profits, dividends or other distributions except in limited circumstances and restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, disposing of assets and repaying subordinated debt; and • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain financial covenants, including minimum tangible net worth, minimum interest cover ratio, loan to fixed asset value ratio and a minimum cash covenant. In general, any default with respect to other indebtedness of AMD or AMD Fab 36 KG that is not cured, would result in a cross-default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. The occurrence of a default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. In addition, the occurrence of a default under these agreements could result in a cross-default under our loan agreements, including the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures, 4.50% Notes and 7.75% Notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. Generally, the amounts under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements and the partnership agreements are denominated in euros. However, we report these amounts in U.S. dollars, which are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate at December 26, 2004, of 0.739 euro to one U.S. dollar, to translate the amounts denominated in euros into U.S. dollars. However, with respect to amounts of limited partnership and other equity contributions, investment grants, allowances and subsidies received by AMD Fab 36 KG through December 26, 2004, we used the historical exchange rates that were in effect at the time AMD Fab 36 KG received these amounts to convert amounts denominated in euros into U.S. dollars. July 2003 Spansion Term Loan and Guarantee Under our July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, as amended, amounts borrowed bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.98 percent at December 26, 2004. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal and interest installments ending in September 2006. As of December 26, 2004, $45 million was outstanding under the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, of which 60 percent is guaranteed by us and 40 percent is guaranteed by Fujitsu. Spansion granted a security interest in certain property, plant and equipment as security under the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan. In addition, as security for our guarantee obligations, we granted a security interest in certain of our assets, including our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (excluding intellectual property) and the related proceeds. 42 Table of Contents Pursuant to the terms of the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, Spansion is required to comply with the following financial covenants during an enhanced covenant period, which occurs if either Spansion’s net domestic cash balance (as defined in the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter is below $60 million or if its net worldwide cash balance (as defined in the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter is below $130 million: • maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan) of not less than $850 million; • achieve EBITDA according to the following schedule: Period Amount (in millions) For the four quarters ending December 2004 $ 550 For the four quarters ending in 2005 $ 640 For the four quarters ending in 2006 $ 800 • maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan) according to the following schedule: Period Ratio Period ending December 2004 1.0 to 1.00 Full Fiscal Year 2005 1.0 to 1.00 Full Fiscal Year 2006 0.9 to 1.00 In addition, during an enhanced covenant period, Spansion is restricted in its ability to pay cash dividends to us or Fujitsu. As of December 26, 2004, Spansion’s net domestic cash balance was $119 million and its net worldwide cash balance was $196 million. Because Spansion was not in an enhanced covenant period, the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. Spansion Japan Term Loan and Guarantee As a result of the formation of Spansion, the third-party loans of the Manufacturing Joint Venture were refinanced from the proceeds of a term loan entered into between Spansion Japan, which owns the assets of the Manufacturing Joint Venture, and a Japanese financial institution. Under the agreement, the amounts borrowed bear an interest rate of TIBOR plus a spread that is determined by Fujitsu’s current debt rating and Spansion Japan’s non-consolidated net asset value as of the last day of its fiscal year. The interest rate was 0.98 percent as of December 26, 2004. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal installments ending in June 2007. As of December 26, 2004, $127 million was outstanding under this term loan agreement. Spansion Japan’s assets are pledged as security for its borrowings under this agreement. Also, Fujitsu guaranteed 100 percent of the amounts outstanding under this facility. We agreed to reimburse Fujitsu 60 percent of any amount paid by Fujitsu under its guarantee of this loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Spansion Japan Term Loan, Spansion Japan is required to comply with the following financial covenants: • ensure that assets exceed liabilities as of the end of each fiscal year and each six-month period during such fiscal year; • maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the loan agreement), as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of not less than 60 billion yen (approximately $579 million based on the exchange rate as of December 26, 2004); 43 Table of Contents • maintain total net income plus depreciation, as of the last day of each fiscal period, as follows: Period Amount (in millions) Fiscal year 2004 $ 221 Fiscal year 2005 $ 204 Fiscal year 2006 $ 188 • ensure that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of (a) net income plus depreciation to (b) the sum of (i) interest expense for such period plus (ii) scheduled amortization of debt for borrowed money (as defined in the loan agreement) for such period, including lease rentals plus (iii) maintenance capital expenditures for Spansion Japan’s existing and after acquired real property and improvements at its manufacturing facilities located in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, is not less than: Period Percentage Third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2004 120 % Fiscal year 2005 120 % Fiscal year 2006 120 % As of December 26, 2004, Spansion Japan was in compliance with these financial covenants. Because most amounts under the Spansion Japan Term Loan are denominated in yen, the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate as of December 26, 2004 of 103.62 yen to one U.S. dollar to translate the amounts denominated in yen into U.S. dollars. Fujitsu Cash Note As a result of the Spansion transaction, Fujitsu loaned $40 million to Spansion pursuant to a promissory note. The note bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.98 percent as of December 26, 2004, and has a term of three years. The interest rate cannot exceed seven percent. The note is repayable in four equal payments on September 30, 2005, December 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Interest is payable quarterly. AMD Penang Term Loan On January 29, 2004, our subsidiary in Malaysia, AMD Export Sdn. Bhd., or AMD Penang, entered into a term loan agreement with a local financial institution. Under the terms of the loan agreement, AMD Penang can borrow up to 30 million Malaysian Ringgit (approximately $8 million as of December 26, 2004) in order to fund the purchase of equipment. The loan bears a fixed annual interest rate of 5.9 percent and is payable in equal, consecutive, monthly principal and interest installments through February 2009. The total amount outstanding as of December 26, 2004 was approximately $6 million. Spansion China Loan During the second quarter of 2004, Spansion (China) Limited, a subsidiary of Spansion, entered into two revolving loan agreements with a local financial institution. Under the terms of the revolving foreign exchange loan agreement, Spansion China can borrow in U.S. dollars up to an amount of $18 million. Under the terms of the revolving Renminbi (RMB) loan agreement, Spansion China can borrow up to RMB 120 million (approximately $14.5 million as of December 26, 2004). The interest rate on the U.S. dollar denominated loans is LIBOR plus one percent and the interest rate on the RMB denominated loans is fixed at 4.779 percent. The maximum term of each loan is 12 months from the date of each drawdown. As of December 26, 2004, Spansion China had fully drawn on the loans. 44 Table of Contents Capital Lease Obligations As of December 26, 2004, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of approximately $185 million. Obligations under these lease agreements are collateralized by the assets leased and are payable through 2008. Leased assets consist principally of machinery and equipment. We guaranteed approximately $87 million of Spansion’s and its subsidiaries’ aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations as of December 26, 2004. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2032. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future lease obligations as of December 26, 2004, were approximately $431 million, of which $106 million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. Unconditional Purchase Commitments Total non-cancelable purchase commitments as of December 26, 2004, were approximately $1.3 billion for periods through 2020. These purchase commitments include approximately $546 million related to contractual obligations to purchase energy and gas for Fab 30 and Fab 36 and $250 million representing future payments to IBM pursuant to the joint development agreement. As IBM’s services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, we expense the payments as incurred. Our non-cancelable purchase commitments also include approximately $141 million to M+W Zander for the design and construction of Fab 36 and other related services. These payments will be made to M+W Zander as services are performed. In addition, unconditional purchase commitments also include approximately $68 million for software maintenance agreements that require periodic payments through 2009. As a result, we have not recorded any liabilities relating to these agreements. The remaining commitments primarily consist of non-cancelable contractual obligations to purchase raw materials, natural resources and office supplies. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable without significant penalties are not included in the amount set forth in the table above. Other Long-Term Liabilities The only component of Other Long-Term Liabilities that requires us to make cash payments is a net restructuring accrual of approximately $87 million relating to the net future operating lease payments on certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We will make these payments through 2011. We included these amounts in the operating lease total in the table above. The other components of Other Long-Term Liabilities do not require us to make cash payments and primarily consist of approximately $274 million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the Fab 30 and Fab 36 projects and a $22 million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our corporate marketing, general and administrative facility in Sunnyvale, California in 1998. Repayment of Dresden Term Loan AMD Saxony, our indirect, wholly owned German subsidiary, continues to facilitize Fab 30, which began production in the second quarter of 2000. AMD, the Federal Republic of Germany, the State of Saxony and a consortium of banks provided financing for the Fab 30 project. We currently estimate that the construction and facilitization costs of Fab 30 will be $2.5 billion when it is fully equipped by the end of 2005. As of December 26, 2004, we had invested approximately $2.4 billion in the Fab 30 project. In March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into a loan agreement and other related agreements (the Dresden Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, in order to finance the project. On November 2, 2004, AMD Saxony prepaid the full amount outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan plus accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment premium, and the Dresden Term Loan 45 Table of Contents and related security agreements were terminated effective December 23, 2004. We recognized a charge of approximately $14 million (included in interest income and other, net) associated with the prepayment of the Dresden Term Loan, which included the prepayment premium of approximately $8.5 million and write-off of remaining capitalized financing costs of approximately $5.3 million. Also in March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into a Subsidy Agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony in support of the Fab 30 project. Under this agreement, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony agreed to provide: • guarantees equal to 65 percent of the amount outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan, which was zero as of December 26, 2004; • capital investment grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $493 million as of December 26, 2004; and • interest subsidies totaling $208 million as of December 26, 2004. Of these amounts, AMD Saxony received approximately $411 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $153 million in interest subsidies through December 26, 2004. AMD Saxony also received $58 million in research and development subsidies through December 26, 2004. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long-term liability on our financial statements and are amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses. As of December 26, 2004, these amounts were being amortized ratably through December 2007. AMD Saxony has received substantially all investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies to which it is entitled. Noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies contained in the Subsidy Agreement could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. Under the original Subsidy Agreement, AMD Saxony undertook to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2003 and to maintain such headcount until December 2008. In April 2004, the German governmental authorities advised AMD Saxony that rather than maintaining employee headcount attained by December 2003 through December 2008, it would be required to maintain employee headcount attained as of December 2002 through December 2007. Beginning in April 2004, we adjusted the quarterly amortization of the grants and allowances until December 2007. In December 2002, AMD Saxony reduced its anticipated employment levels as a result of the 2002 Restructuring Plan. Consequently, as of December 26, 2004, headcount was below the level agreed to by AMD Saxony at which AMD Saxony would be entitled to receive the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available. Although the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available under the Subsidy Agreement was reduced from $563 million to approximately $493 million, this reduction did not result in a repayment of capital investment grants and allowances already received. We adjusted the quarterly amortization of these amounts accordingly. Sachsische Aufbaubank GmbH, (the SAB) an entity acting on behalf of the Free State of Saxony, requested that AMD Saxony exchange investment grants that it had previously received in the amount of approximately $101 million for an equivalent amount of investment allowances. AMD Saxony has agreed to repay these investment grants in 2005. AMD Saxony will receive the corresponding amount of investment allowances from the German tax authorities. There is no right of setoff between these two amounts because investment grants are co-financed by the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany whereas investment allowances are financed only by the Federal Republic of Germany. Accordingly, as of December 26, 2004, we recorded a receivable for the investment allowances and a payable in a corresponding amount for the investment grants. The receivable and payable are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the exchange will not have an impact on our operating results and cash flows. 46 Table of Contents Guarantees Guarantees of Indebtedness Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 26, 2004 related to underlying liabilities that are already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2004 and their expected expiration dates by year. No incremental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for these guarantees. For more information on these guarantees, see “Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees,” above.

(2) This is the amount of silent partnership contributions received by AMD Fab 36 KG, as of December 26, 2004 from the unaffliated limited partners under the Fab 36 partnership agreements. Assuming certain milestones are met by AMD Fab 36 KG, we expect to receive a total of up to $189 million of silent partnership contributions. AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are required to repurchase each partner’s silent partnership contribution in annual installments one year after the partner has contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements. We guaranteed these obligations. As of December 26, 2004, Fab 36 Beteiligungs had contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements, but Leipziger Messe had not contributed the full amount. Therefore, the condition precedent to our repurchase obligations with respect to Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership contribution had not been met. See “Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements,” above. Guarantees of Indebtedness not Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 26, 2004 for which the related underlying liabilities are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2004 and their expected expiration dates: AmountsGuaranteed (1) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 andBeyond (in thousands) Spansion operating lease guarantees $ 24,414 $ 13,267 $ 8,069 $ 2,052 $ 1,026 — — AMTC revolving loan guarantee $ 43,308 — — $ 43,308 — — — AMTC rental guarantee (2) $ 153,489 — — — — — $ 153,489 Other $ 5,629 $ 1,813 $ 3,816 — — — — Total guarantees $ 226,840 $ 15,080 $ 11,885 $ 45,360 $ 1,026 — $ 153,489 (1) Amounts represent the principal amount of the underlying obligations guaranteed and are exclusive of obligations for interest, fees and expenses. (2) Amount of the guarantee diminishes as the rent is paid. 47 Table of Contents Spansion Operating Lease Guarantees We guaranteed certain operating leases entered into by Spansion and its subsidiaries totaling approximately $24 million as of December 26, 2004. The amounts guaranteed are reduced by the lease payments paid by Spansion over the lease term. Under the provision of FIN 45, we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees because they are for our subsidiary’s performance obligations. AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co., KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by us, Infineon Technologies AG and DuPont Photomasks, Inc. for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. The results of operations of AMTC, which we account for following the equity method of accounting, are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. To finance the project, BAC and AMTC entered into a $162 million revolving credit facility and a $102 million term loan in December 2002. Also in December 2002, in order to occupy the photomask facility, AMTC entered into a rental agreement with BAC. With regard to these commitments by BAC and AMTC, as of December 26, 2004, we guaranteed up to approximately $43 million plus interest and expenses under the revolving loan, and up to approximately $20 million, initially, under the rental agreement. The obligations under the rental agreement guarantee diminish over time through 2011 as the term loan is repaid. However, under certain circumstances of default by the other tenant of the photomask facility under its rental agreement with BAC and certain circumstances of default by more than one joint venture partner under its rental agreement guarantee obligations, the maximum potential amount of our obligations under the rental agreement guarantee is approximately $153 million. As of December 26, 2004, $80 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility, and $78 million was drawn under the term loan. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees because they were issued prior to December 31, 2002, the effective date of FIN 45. Other Financial Matters Spansion LLC. During the four-year period commencing on June 30, 2003, we are obligated to provide Spansion with additional funding to finance operations shortfalls, if any. Generally, Spansion is first required to seek any required financing from external sources. However, if such third-party financing is not available, we must provide funding to Spansion equal to our pro-rata ownership interest, which is currently 60 percent. At this time, we believe that Spansion would be able to obtain such external financing when needed. However, there is no assurance that this will happen and currently we cannot estimate the amount of such additional funding, if any, that we are required to provide during this four-year period. Sale Leaseback Transaction In January 2005, Spansion Japan entered into a sale and leaseback transaction for certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the amount of approximately 8.2 billion yen (approximately $79 million based on the exchange rate as of December 26, 2004). As the sales proceeds slightly exceed the net book value of the equipment, there is a minimal deferred gain to be recognized on the sale. Under the agreement, the lease payments will be made in six equal semi-annual payments and the lease will terminate on December 31, 2007. At the expiration of the lease term, Spansion Japan has the option to purchase the equipment at an agreed upon price, which we believe to be a bargain purchase option. In addition, Spansion Japan can renew the lease if the lessor and Spansion Japan both agree upon the renewal terms not later than six months prior to the expiration of the lease term. During the term of the lease, Spansion Japan is required to comply with certain financial covenants. 48 Table of Contents Outlook During the first quarter of 2005, for our Computation Products segment, we expect net sales to decline slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. For our Memory Products segment, we expect net sales to decline during the first quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 due to continued imbalance in supply and demand, continued pressure on average selling prices and seasonality. In fiscal 2005, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.2 billion, and research and development expenses, both in total dollars and as a percentage of sales, to increase primarily due to Fab 36 start-up costs of approximately $200 million. We also expect total marketing, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2005, but to decline as a percentage of sales. In 2005, our strategy is to expand our position in the enterprise segment with our AMD64-based processors; to leverage our Spansion product portfolio to expand our position in the Flash memory market, and to increase the adoption of our MirrorBit technology. However, economic and industry conditions remain uncertain and continue to make it particularly difficult to forecast product demand. If economic conditions do not continue to improve in the near term in accordance with our expectations, or if the semiconductor industry experiences a significant downturn, our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected. Supplementary Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Disclosures Section I. Option Program Description Our stock option programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, our stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan), which had previously been approved by our Board of Directors. Stock options available for grant under our equity compensation plans that were in effect before April 29, 2004, (the Prior Plans), including those that were not approved by our stockholders, were consolidated into the 2004 Plan. As of April 29, 2004, equity awards are made only from the 2004 Plan. Under our Prior Plans key employees generally were, and under the 2004 Plan key employees generally are, granted nonqualified stock options (NSOs) to purchase our common stock. Generally, options vest and become exercisable over a four-year period from the date of grant and expire five to ten years after the date of grant. Any incentive stock options (ISOs) granted under the Prior Plans or the 2004 Plan have exercise prices of not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Exercise prices of NSOs range from $0.01 to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Under the 2004 Plan, we have also granted awards of restricted stock. The purchase price for an award of restricted stock is $0.01 per share. Restricted stock can be granted to any employee or consultant. Restricted stock that vests based on continued service does not fully vest for three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock that vests based on performance does not vest for at least one year from the date of grant. 49 Table of Contents Section II. General Option Information The following is a summary of stock option activity for the years ended December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003: Year-ended December 26, 2004 Year-ended December 28, 2003 Number ofShares Weighted-AverageExercisePrice Number ofShares Weighted-AverageExercisePrice (in thousands except share price) Options: Outstanding at beginning of year 40,969 $ 12.92 60,408 $ 18.58 Granted 26,121 $ 14.54 5,575 $ 9.46 Canceled (3,425 ) $ 23.20 (22,642 ) $ 27.69 Exercised (9,981 ) $ 10.08 (2,372 ) $ 7.86 Outstanding at end of year 53,684 $ 13.58 40,969 $ 12.92 Exercisable at end of year 32,250 $ 13.72 28,624 $ 13.66 Available for grant at beginning of year 29,613 13,019 Available for grant at end of year 23,901 29,613 In-the-money and out-of-the-money stock option information as of December 26, 2004, was as follows: Exercisable Unexercisable Total As of End of Quarter Shares WeightedAverageExercisePrice Shares WeightedAverageExercisePrice Shares WeightedAverageExercisePrice (in thousands except share price) In-the-Money 29,071 $ 11.84 21,079 N/A (3) 50,150 $ 12.40 Out-of-the-Money(1) 3,179 $ 30.86 355 N/A (3) 3,534 $ 30.23 Total Options Outstanding 32,250 $ 13.72 21,434 53,684 (2) $ 13.58 (1) Out-of-the-money stock options have an exercise price equal to or above $22.12, the closing price of AMD’s common stock, on the last trading day of our fiscal year, December 23, 2004.

(3) The “listed officers” are those executive officers listed in the summary compensation table in our proxy statements for our annual meeting of stockholders to be held on April 28, 2005, and the annual meetings of stockholders held in 2004 and 2003. 50 Table of Contents On June 27, 2003, we filed a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC and made an offer, which was approved by our stockholders, to exchange certain stock options to purchase shares of our common stock, outstanding under eligible option plans and held by eligible employees, for replacement options to be granted no sooner than six months and one day from the cancellation of the surrendered options. The offer to exchange expired on July 25, 2003. Options to purchase approximately 19 million shares of our common stock were tendered for exchange and cancelled on July 28, 2003. On January 30, 2004, we granted options to purchase approximately 12 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price that represented the closing price of our common stock on that date, in exchange for options cancelled. We did not record compensation expense as a result of the exchange. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued a revision to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R eliminates our ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and generally requires a public entity to reflect on its income statement, instead of pro forma disclosures in its financial footnotes, the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The grant-date fair value will be estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those equity instruments. Among other things, SFAS 123R also requires entities to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered and, if the terms or conditions of an equity award are modified after the grant date, to recognize incremental compensation cost for such a modification by comparing the fair value of the modified award with the fair value of the award immediately before the modification. In addition, SFAS 123R amends FASB Statement No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows,” to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. SFAS 123R is effective generally for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. As of the required effective date, all public entities that used the fair-value-based method for either recognition or disclosure under the original Statement 123 will apply this revised statement using a modified version of prospective application. Under that transition method, compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards calculated under the original Statement 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosures. For periods before the required effective date, those entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original Statement 123. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R and will adopt this statement at the effective date. Although we cannot estimate the exact amount at this time, we expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial statements. 51 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS If we cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may be unable to make all of our planned capital expenditures or fulfill our obligations to Fab 36 or Spansion. Our ability to fund capital expenditures in accordance with our business plan depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing. In 2005, we plan to make approximately $1.5 billion in capital expenditures. Moreover, under the partnership agreement for AMD Fab 36 KG, our German subsidiaries, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are obligated to invest approximately $792 million into AMD Fab 36 KG. In addition, under the revolving credit agreement among AMD, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 KG, we or AMD Fab 36 Holding are required to provide up to approximately $1.0 billion to AMD Fab 36 KG. Loans provided to AMD Fab 36 KG under this revolving credit agreement are unsecured and subordinated to the rights of the consortium of banks that will also be providing financing to AMD Fab 36 KG. We are also obligated through June 30, 2007 to provide Spansion with additional funding to finance operational cash flow needs. Generally, Spansion must seek any required financing from external sources. However, if third-party financing is not available, either on a non-recourse basis to us or with guarantees based on our pro rata ownership interest, we must provide funding to Spansion equal to our pro rata ownership interest in Spansion, which is currently 60 percent. An inability to meet our funding obligations for Spansion could, among other things, result in additional equity in Spansion being issued to Fujitsu or third parties, which would reduce our ownership in and control over Spansion. Our capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and market competition. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain needed debt and/ or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures. If we curtail capital expenditures or abandon projects, we could be materially adversely affected. For example, if we abandon the Fab 36 project, we will have to write off related costs that we capitalized and we will be required to continue to make payments or otherwise be liable pursuant to then-existing contracts that we cannot terminate at will or without significant penalties. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position. As of December 26, 2004, we had consolidated debt of approximately $1.9 billion. In addition, we guaranteed approximately $227 million of obligations, which are not reflected on our balance sheet. Our substantial indebtedness may: • make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; • limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; • limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; • require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; • limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; 52 Table of Contents • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and • increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, in the future. Subject to the restrictions in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. In particular, as of December 26, 2004, we and our subsidiaries would have had the following additional borrowings available: • Up to $100 million under our revolving credit facility. Amounts borrowed under this facility are secured by all of our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (excluding intellectual property) and the related proceeds, excluding Spansion’s accounts receivable, inventory and general intangibles. • Spansion Japan had up to 15 billion yen (approximately $145 million as of December 26, 2004) available under a revolving credit facility. • AMD Fab 36 KG will have the ability, subject to achieving certain milestones, to borrow up to $947 million (based on an exchange rate of 0.739 euro to one U.S. dollar as of December 26, 2004) from a consortium of banks under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements during 2006 and 2007. Although the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, or our guarantees of other parties’ debts, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt, or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indentures governing our 4.50% Notes, 4.75% Debentures and 7.75% Notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to: • incur additional indebtedness; • pay dividends and make other restricted payments; • make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; • create or permit certain liens; • create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • use the proceeds from sales of assets; • enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and 53 Table of Contents • consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In addition: • The guarantees associated with the Fab 36 Loan Agreements contain restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on the ability of AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments, and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts. • Our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on our ability to pay dividends, and also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when our net domestic cash is below specified amounts. • The July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, as amended, contains restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on Spansion’s ability to pay dividends and also requires Spansion to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when its net domestic cash or its net worldwide cash is below specified amounts. Our ability to satisfy the covenants, financial ratios and tests of our debt instruments can be affected by events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the applicable agreement. In addition, our agreements contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness that results in acceleration of the maturity date or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes. Similarly, a default with respect to any indebtedness in excess of $25 million would cause a cross-default under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and 4.50% Notes. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have granted a security interest in substantially all of our inventory and accounts receivable under our revolving credit facility, and in certain property, plant and equipment under the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan Agreement. If the lenders under any of the credit facilities or the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures, 4.50% Notes and 7.75% Notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products, or if there is a significant delay in Microsoft’s release of an operating system that works with our AMD64 technology, our ability to sell our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets, including the timely introduction of an operating system that works with our AMD64 technology, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our microprocessors. If we fail to retain the support of Microsoft, our ability to market our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected. In July 2004, Microsoft announced a delay in the release of its Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2003 for 64-bit Extended Systems and Windows XP 64-bit for 64-bit Extended Systems. The new Windows editions are designed to take advantage of 64-bit extensions to the standard x86 instruction set. Microsoft estimated that the release of this software will occur in the first half of 2005. Previously, Microsoft 54 Table of Contents estimated the release date for this software would be in late 2004. This delay could adversely impact the timing of development of 64-bit applications by independent software providers and the adoption of 64-bit computing by end users. As a result, this delay could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our AMD 64-based processors. We must achieve further market acceptance of our 64-bit technology, AMD64, or we will be materially adversely affected. We designed our AMD64-based processors to provide users with the ability to take advantage of 64-bit applications while preserving their ability to run existing 32-bit applications on servers and workstations and on desktop and mobile PCs. Market acceptance of these processors is subject to risks and uncertainties including: • the support of operating system and application program providers for our 64-bit instruction set, including timely development of 64-bit applications; • the willingness of users to purchase products with 64-bit capability prior to the availability of operating systems and software applications that take full advantage of our AMD64 technology; • our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner on advanced process technologies, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; and • the availability, performance and feature set of motherboards, memory and chipsets designed for these processors. If we are unable to achieve further market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, we will be materially adversely affected. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading-edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, or obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive. For example, we have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we work together to develop new process technologies. In September 2004, we amended this agreement and extended its termination date from December 2005 to December 2008. Under this amended agreement, we anticipate that from December 26, 2004 through December 2008, we would pay fees to IBM of between approximately $220 million and $250 million in connection with joint development projects. In addition, from the beginning of 2002 through December 26, 2004, we paid approximately $247 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities. If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume research and development activities for microprocessors internally or find an alternative partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which could materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the successful and timely development and implementation of silicon-on-insulator technology and the achievement of other milestones set forth in the joint development agreement are critical to our AMD64-based processors and to our ability to commence operations at Fab 36 in accordance with our planned schedule. 55 Table of Contents The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected, and may in the future materially adversely affect, our business. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles, manufacturing overcapacity and declines in general economic conditions. Our historical financial results have also been subject to substantial fluctuations. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. We incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to: • the cyclical nature of supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; • a decline in demand for end-user products that incorporate our semiconductors; • excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including our customers; • excess production capacity; and • accelerated declines in average selling prices. For example, in 2001 and 2002, we implemented restructuring plans due to weak customer demand associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the downturn in the Flash memory market contributed to a decline in our Memory Product net sales. If these conditions in the semiconductor industry occur, we could be materially adversely affected. Fluctuations in demand for PCs and mobile telephones and other consumer electronics may adversely affect sales of our products. The Computation Products segment of our business is dependent upon the market for computers, including PCs. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Depending on the growth rate of computers sold, sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease. If end-user demand for computers is below our expectations, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from Intel Corporation, such as Dell, Inc., could further materially adversely affect us. The Memory Products segment of our business is dependent to a large degree upon demand for mobile telephones as well as consumer electronics, automotive electronics and other embedded applications. If demand for these devices is below our expectations or if the manufacturers of successive generations of these devices do not require NOR-based Flash memory products or increasing Flash memory content, we could be materially adversely affected. Intense competition in the microprocessor and Flash memory markets could materially adversely affect us. The IC industry is intensely competitive. With respect to our microprocessor products, our competitor is Intel. Microprocessor products compete on performance, quality, reliability, price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, marketing and distribution capability, brand recognition and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. We may not be able to compete effectively if we fail to reduce our costs on existing products or fail to develop and introduce, on a cost-effective and timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products with higher margins. Our principal competitors in the Flash memory market are Intel, Samsung, Toshiba, STMicroelectronics N.V., Sharp Electronics Corporation, Silicon Storage Technology and Macronix International. The Flash memory market is characterized by migration to higher density and lower cost devices and a competitive pricing 56 Table of Contents environment. In addition, ample capacity for manufacturing Flash memory products exists due to recent capital investment by some of our competitors, which is likely to further contribute to a competitive pricing environment. In the past, including the second half of 2004, the net increases of supply, meaning the difference of capacity additions less capacity reductions due to obsolescence, exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry. In the second half of 2004, fluctuations in the rate at which industry capacity grew relative to the growth rate in demand for Flash memory products, particularly NOR-based products, contributed to a decrease in our average selling prices and hurt our results of operations. If this continues in the future we would be materially adversely affected. To compete successfully, we must transition to technologies that meet the increasing demand for higher Flash memory content in mobile phones, consumer electronics and automotive applications, among other markets, at competitive prices. We expect competition in the Flash memory market to increase as existing manufacturers introduce new products, new manufacturers enter the market, industry-wide production capacity increases, to the extent potential customers choose NAND-based products over NOR-based products and competitors aggressively price their Flash memory products. In addition, we and certain of our competitors have licensed non-volatile memory technology called NROM technology from a third party. NROM technology allows memory devices to store two bits of data in a memory cell. NROM technology has similar characteristics to our MirrorBit technology, which may allow these competitors to develop Flash memory technology that is competitive with MirrorBit technology. Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market, its position in the Flash memory market and its business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in desktop and mobile PCs for many years. Intel is also a dominant competitor in the server segment of the microprocessor market and a significant competitor in the Flash memory market. Intel’s significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, particularly microprocessors and Flash memory products, and adversely affect our margins and profitability. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s: • pricing and allocation strategies and actions, including aggressive pricing for Flash memory products and microprocessors to increase market share; • product mix and introduction schedules; • product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; • exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; • control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers; and • strong brand, and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of the brand. For example, with respect to the microprocessor market, Intel exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the “Intel Inside” brand program and other marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intel’s competitors. Intel also dominates the PC system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a PC system. As a result, PC OEMs are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. In marketing our microprocessors to OEMs, we depend on 57 Table of Contents third-party companies other than Intel for the design and manufacture of core-logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and other components. In recent years, many of these third-party designers and manufacturers have lost significant market share to Intel or exited the business. In addition, Intel has significant leverage over these companies because they support each new generation of Intel’s microprocessors. We do not currently plan to develop microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with Intel microprocessors because our patent-cross license agreement with Intel does not extend to Intel’s proprietary bus interface protocol. Thus, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. Our ability to compete with Intel in the market for microprocessors will depend on our continued success in developing and maintaining relationships with infrastructure providers in order to ensure that these third-party designers and manufacturers of motherboards, chipsets and other system components support our microprocessor offerings, particularly AMD64-based microprocessors. A failure of the designers and manufacturers of motherboards, chipsets and other system components to support our microprocessor offerings, particularly our AMD64-based microprocessors, could have a material adverse effect on us. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market, to continue to be a significant competitor in the Flash memory market and to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We also expect competition from Intel to increase to the extent Intel reduces prices on its microprocessor and/or Flash memory products and introduces new competitive products. For example, in 2004 Intel introduced a 64-bit processor for servers and workstations that runs existing 32-bit software applications. This processor competes with our AMD Opteron microprocessor. In addition, Intel recently announced that it will offer dual-core 64-bit processors for the desktop market in the second quarter of 2005. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology, which can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture. We are currently completing our transition to 90-nanometer process technology for microprocessor manufacturing, and we expect to transition to 300-millimeter wafers in 2006. To the extent Intel manufactures its microprocessor products on larger wafers and smaller process technologies earlier than we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. Collectively, our top five OEM and distributor customers (including Fujitsu) accounted for approximately 50 percent of our total gross revenues in 2004. In addition, our Flash memory product sales growth is dependent to a large extent on demand for high-end mobile telephones and our sales in the wireless market have been concentrated in a limited group of customers. If we were to lose a significant customer, or if one of our top customers downsizes or otherwise contracts its operations, demand for our products could decrease and we would be materially adversely affected. If we fail to keep pace with new product designs and improvements or if we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted, customers may not buy our products and we may be adversely affected. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop and qualify such products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements and at prices acceptable to our customers are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. If we are delayed in developing or qualifying new technologies, we could be materially adversely affected. For 58 Table of Contents example, during the second half of 2004 we experienced a delay in qualifying a new Spansion Flash memory product for the wireless segment. This delay contributed to lower than anticipated Flash memory product revenues for the quarter ended December 26, 2004. Qualifying this product in accordance with our specifications and our revised schedule is critical to our ability to increase sales of our Memory Products segment. In addition, we plan to introduce our dual-core microprocessors for servers and workstations in mid-2005, followed by dual-processors for the PC market in the second half of 2005. If we are not able to introduce dual-core processors on a timely basis or if our dual-core processors do not achieve market acceptance, we will be materially adversely affected. A lack of market acceptance of MirrorBit technology could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that market acceptance of MirrorBit technology is a critical factor impacting our ability to increase Flash memory product revenues and market share and decrease the cost of products in our Memory Products segment. MirrorBit technology is a memory cell architecture that enables Flash memory products to store two bits of data in a single memory cell thereby doubling the density or storage capacity of each memory cell. A lack of continued market acceptance of MirrorBit technology, adoption of such technology at a slower rate than we anticipate, or any substantial difficulty in transitioning Flash memory products, including those based on MirrorBit technology, to any future process technology could reduce our ability to be competitive in the market. Spansion Flash memory products are based on NOR architecture, and a significant market shift to NAND architecture could materially adversely affect us. Flash memory products are generally based on either NOR architecture or NAND architecture. NAND has historically been the preferred architecture for data storage because of attributes such as high densities and fast write and erase speeds. NOR has been the preferred architecture for code storage because of its fast read performance and superior reliability. To date, our Flash memory products have been based on NOR architecture, and we do not manufacture products based on NAND architecture. During 2003 and 2004, industry sales of products based on NAND architecture grew at higher rates than sales of NOR-based products. This resulted in NAND vendors gaining a greater share of the overall Flash memory market. As mobile telephones and other consumer-driven applications become more advanced they will require higher density Flash memory to meet increased data storage requirements. Because storage requirements will increase to accommodate data-intensive applications, customers may increasingly choose NAND-based products. Any significant shift in the marketplace to products based on NAND architecture or other architectures may reduce the total market available to us and therefore reduce our revenues and market share. We intend to address end markets traditionally served by NAND-based products with products based on our ORNAND architecture. We are currently developing these products and if they, or any future products based on our MirrorBit technology and ORNAND architecture, fail to achieve acceptance in markets traditionally served by NAND architecture, or at all, we could be materially adversely affected. We are required to reach agreement with Fujitsu regarding certain actions of our majority-owned subsidiary, Spansion, and our interests may not be aligned. We own 60 percent of the equity interest in Spansion while Fujitsu owns the remaining 40 percent. Although we are entitled to appoint a majority of the board of managers, which generally manages the affairs of Spansion, certain actions by Spansion require Fujitsu’s consent for as long as Fujitsu maintains specific levels of equity ownership in Spansion. In addition, based upon designated thresholds of Fujitsu’s percentage interest in Spansion, certain actions require the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the managers appointed by Fujitsu. These actions, which primarily represent protective rights for Fujitsu as a minority member, include: • major investments, acquisitions and dispositions of assets; 59 Table of Contents • a merger or consolidation resulting in the transfer of more than 50% of the equity interests; • settlement of major legal proceedings and other actions; • approval of certain material contracts between us and Spansion; • changes to the equity capital structure of the Spansion; and • winding-up Spansion or one of its material subsidiaries. There can be no guarantee that our interests and those of Fujitsu will be aligned with respect to such decisions and we may be unable to take steps that we believe are desirable. In addition, a reduction in our percentage interest may result in our inability to appoint a majority of Spansion’s board of managers, which could result in the loss of effective control of Spansion, although the results of operations of Spansion may continue to impact significantly our results of operations and we still may be required to make loans to, and guarantee indebtedness of, Spansion. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. A substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of net sales for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, demand in the retail sector of the PC market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control. Manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may adversely affect us. There may be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could have a material adverse effect on us. At times we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products. During such times, many of our costs remain fixed and cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period. We are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by facilitizing Fab 36, transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies and making significant capital investments in our existing manufacturing facilities. If the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations, we may underutilize manufacturing facilities. This has in the past had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on us. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing our products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. We continuously modify manufacturing processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs. We may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, delays in the development of new process technologies, changes in our process technologies, upgrades or expansion of existing facilities, or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process. We are currently completing the transition to 90-nanometer process technology for our microprocessor products. In addition, we plan to transition the manufacture of certain Flash memory products to 90-nanometer 60 Table of Contents process technology in the second half of 2005. During periods when we are implementing new process technologies, manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do. Our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. If our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. One or more of our products may be found to be defective after the product has been shipped to customers in volume. The cost of a recall, software fix, product replacements and/or product returns may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, modifications needed to fix the defect may impede performance of the product. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. We purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because some equipment and material that we purchase is complex, it is sometimes difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. In addition, certain raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we are largely dependent on one supplier for our 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. Although there are alternative sources available, we have not qualified these sources and we do not believe that they currently have sufficient capacity to meet our requirements for SOI wafers. We are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of IC packages we purchase. Similarly, we purchase commercial non-Flash memory die, such as SRAM and pSRAM, from third-party suppliers and incorporate these die into Spansion MCP products. Some of these suppliers are also our competitors in the Flash memory market. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials, we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on us. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. 61 Table of Contents We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including physical distribution of our products, and co-source some information technology services. We rely on a third-party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we rely on a third-party provider in India to provide certain information technology services to us, including helpdesk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access. Our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations, the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for our facilities could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we decided to outsource or co-source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and to create a more variable cost structure. However, if the costs related to administration, communication and coordination of these third-party providers are greater than we expect, then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could materially adversely affect us. Sales of our products are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our microprocessor customers. From time to time, we enter into long-term supply arrangements with our Flash memory customers. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which are difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory. Because market conditions are uncertain, these and other factors could materially adversely affect us. Our reliance on third-party distributors subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. In addition, these agreements are non-exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors’ products. In 2004, one of our distributors, Avnet, accounted for approximately 13 percent of our consolidated gross sales. In addition, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 22 percent of our consolidated gross sales in 2004. Fujitsu primarily distributes Spansion Flash memory products. Accordingly, we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors’ products over our products, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book or that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re-sold by the distributors. However, in the event of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products, the price 62 Table of Contents protection rights we offer to our distributors could materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets. Our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated net sales were approximately 80 percent and 79 percent in 2003 and 2004. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products are performed at manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. We manufacture our microprocessors in Germany and certain Spansion Flash memory products are manufactured in Japan. We also depend on foreign foundry suppliers for the production of certain of our embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and we depend on an international joint venture for the manufacture of optical photomasks that we intend to use in the manufacture of our microprocessors. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: • expropriation; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • difficulty in protecting our intellectual property; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates; • restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; • changes in freight and interest rates; • disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and • loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs. Any of the above events could have a material adverse effect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. The last economic slowdown in the United States and worldwide adversely affected demand for our products. Although economic conditions have improved since the second half of 2003, another decline in the worldwide semiconductor market or a future decline in economic conditions or consumer confidence in any significant geographic area would likely decrease the overall demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, China’s economy has been growing at a fast pace over the past several years, and Chinese authorities have recently introduced various measures to slow down the pace of economic growth. For example, during the third quarter of 2004, decreased demand from the wireless handset market in Asia, in part due to channel inventory accumulation by wireless handset OEMs in China, contributed to a decline in Memory Products net sales. If Chinese authorities are not able to stage an orderly slowdown, China’s economy could be affected. If economic conditions decline, whether in China or worldwide, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the Middle East have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect demand for our products. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations directly or indirectly and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, ultimately affecting our sales. 63 Table of Contents Also as a result of terrorism, the United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales, our supply chain and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. As a result of our foreign operations, we have sales, costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the European Union euro and the Japanese yen. For example: • a significant portion of our manufacturing costs for our microprocessor products is denominated in euro while sales of those products are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars; • certain manufacturing costs for our Spansion Flash memory products are denominated in yen; • some fixed asset purchases are denominated in euro and yen; • sales of our Flash memory products in Japan are denominated in yen; and • certain costs of our Fab 36 project are denominated in euro. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our U.S. dollar-denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As of December 26, 2004 we had an aggregate of $483 million (notional amount) of short-term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in euro and yen. However, generally, we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, even where revenues and expenses are matched, we must translate euro and yen denominated results of operations, assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the euro or yen will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in their original currency. These transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and/or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted products, which adversely affects demand for our products. In addition, our inability to control gray marketing activities could result in customer satisfaction issues, because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel, there is a risk that our customers are 64 Table of Contents buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products represented as new. Our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks and other common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. We may become a party to intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from using some technology, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products, increase the costs of selling some of our products, or damage our reputation. We could decide, in the alternative, to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others will always be avoided or successfully concluded. Our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities. Failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing process, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment; to modify product designs; or to incur other expenses associated with compliance with environmental regulations. Any failure to control the use of, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future litigation proceedings may materially adversely affect us. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages. In addition, future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the 65 Table of Contents attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in California and manufacturing facilities for Spansion Flash memory products are located near major earthquake fault lines in Japan. In the event of a major earthquake, or other natural or manmade disaster, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and/or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect us. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In order to reduce this interest rate risk, we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities. As of December 26, 2004, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short-term investments and consisted primarily of bank notes, short-term corporate notes, short-term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short-term federal agency notes. The majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term. We continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate. We do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We use proceeds from debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital needs. However, we used the net proceeds from the sale of our 7.75% Notes along with existing cash, to prepay the full amount owed by AMD Saxony under the Dresden Term Loan, including accrued and unpaid interest through the prepayment date and a prepayment premium. 66 Table of Contents The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 26, 2004 and comparable fair values as of December 28, 2003: 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total 2004 Fair value 2003 Fair value (Dollars in Thousands) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 511,566 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 511,566 $ 511,566 $ 256,515 Weighted-average rate 2.19% — — — — — 2.19% 2.19% Variable rate amounts $ 281,000 — — — — — $ 281,000 $ 281,000 $ 576,204 Weighted-average rate 2.21% — — — — — 2.21% 2.21% Short-term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 2,879 $ $ $ $ $ $ 2,879 $ 2,557 $ 26,703 Weighted-average rate 2.50% — — — — — 2.50% 2.50% Variable rate amounts $ 274,625 — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 274,625 $ 274,625 $ 100,860 Weighted-average rate 2.35% — — — — — 2.35% 2.35% Long-term investments: Equity investments $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3,492 $ 3,492 $ 6,653 $ 16,845 Fixed rate amounts $ 13,676 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 13,676 $ 13,676 $ 12,163 Weighted-average rate 2.26% — — — — — 2.26% 2.26% Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,083,746 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3,492 $ 1,087,238 $ 1,090,077 $ 989,290 Debt Obligations Debt—fixed rate amounts $ 17,760 $ 27,940 $ 229,440 $ 27,940 $ 26,676 $ 1,100,000 $ 1,429,756 $ 1,927,626 $ 902,500 Weighted-average rate 6.15% 6.19% 6.19% 6.49% 6.49% 6.39% 6.51% 6.51% 4.64% Debt—variable rate amounts $ 116,322 $ 93,423 $ 34,742 $ — $ — $ — $ 244,487 $ 244,487 $ 944,482 Weighted-average rate 3.96% 3.96% 1.11% — — — 3.55% 3.55% 4.60% Capital leases $ 96,746 $ 83,079 $ 4,816 $ 212 $ — $ — $ 184,853 $ 183,406 $ 244,641 Weighted-average rate 4.76% 3.82% 7.43% 0.64% — — 4.40% 4.40% 5.50% Total Debt Obligations $ 230,828 $ 204,442 $ 268,998 $ 28,152 $ 26,676 $ 1,100,000 $ 1,859,096 $ 2,355,519 $ 2,091,623 Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we have sales, costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the European Union euro and the Japanese yen. For example: • a significant portion of our manufacturing costs for our microprocessor products is denominated in euro while sales of those products are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars; • certain manufacturing costs for our Spansion Flash memory products are denominated in yen; • some fixed asset purchases are denominated in euro and yen; • sales of our Flash memory products in Japan are denominated in yen; and • certain costs of our Fab 36 project are denominated in euro. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our U.S. dollar-denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our profitability and cash flows. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 26, 2004, we had an aggregate of $483 million (notional amount) of short-term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in Japanese yen and European Union euro outstanding. 67 Table of Contents Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 26, 2004 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. In particular, generally, we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, even where revenues and expenses are matched, we must translate euro and yen denominated results of operations, assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the euro or yen will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in their original currency. These transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and/or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2005, which are included in this annual report. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Overview We design, manufacture and market microprocessors for the computing, communications and consumer electronics markets. We also sell embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and other consumer markets. Prior to the closing of the initial public offering, or IPO, of Spansion Inc., our formerly consolidated majority owned subsidiary, on December 21, 2005, which is described in more detail below, we also manufactured and sold Flash memory devices through, Spansion (formerly Spansion LLC). Total net sales for 2005 of $5.8 billion increased 17 percent compared with net sales for 2004 of $5.0 billion. This growth was driven by the performance of our Computation Products segment where net sales of $3.8 billion increased by 50 percent compared to 2004, due to increased unit sales and average selling prices. We believe that our strategy of developing new generations of products based on our customers’ needs contributed to accelerating customer and end-user adoption of our microprocessors across all geographies. In particular, our introduction of AMD Turion 64 processors for notebook PCs in March 2005, AMD Opteron dual-core processors for servers and workstations in April 2005, and AMD Athlon 64 dual-core processors for desktop PCs in May 2005 helped drive increasing customer adoption of our products. Moreover, we believe that our sales growth in each of our product lines outpaced the industry, resulting in increased market share for us. Sales of products for the server market was the fastest growing part of our business in 2005, followed by sales of products for notebook PCs and sales of products for desktop PCs. Increasing demand from enterprises for our products allowed us to add a number of new customers. As a result, 90 percent of the top 100, and more than 45 percent of the top 500 of the Forbes Global 2000 companies or their subsidiaries use AMD64 technology. On December 21, 2005, Spansion Inc. completed its IPO of 47,264,000 shares of its Class A common stock. Prior to the IPO, Spansion was our majority owned subsidiary and its financial position, results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours. However, due to Spansion’s IPO, our ownership interest in Spansion was diluted from 60 percent to 37.9 percent. As a result, we no longer exercise control over Spansion and we no longer consolidate Spansion’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows with ours. We began applying the equity method of accounting to reflect our investment in Spansion and our share of Spansion’s net income from December 21, 2005 based on our remaining equity interest, which is currently 37.9 percent. The overall growth of our annual net sales was partially offset by the results of our Memory Products segment. In 2005, net sales of our Memory Products segment of approximately $1.9 billion decreased 18 percent compared to net sales of approximately $2.3 billion in 2004. In 2005, we consolidated Spansion’s results of operations in our Memory Products segment only through December 20, 2005 because of Spansion’s IPO. Therefore, approximately $104 million of Spansion’s net sales from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005 were excluded from our Memory Products net sales in 2005. Other factors that contributed to the decline in Memory Products net sales included aggressive pricing by competitors due in most cases to oversupply of products in the NOR Flash memory market and a delay in Spansion’s qualification of a Flash memory product for the wireless category, which contributed to lower Memory Products net sales during the first half of 2005. During 2005, we reduced our debt and capital lease obligations by $489 million, which includes the deconsolidation of $370 million of Spansion’s indebtedness to third parties as a result of Spansion’s IPO. 24 Table of Contents Moreover, as of December 25, 2005, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.8 billion, which includes cash proceeds of approximately $260 million from Spansion’s repayment of amounts outstanding under loans due to us, compared to $1.2 billion as of December 26, 2004. We also substantially completed the construction and initial facilitization of Fab 36, our 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany. We intend to make production shipments of wafers manufactured using 90-nanometer technology in Fab 36 in the first quarter of 2006 and to begin manufacturing using 65-nanometer technology by the end of 2006. Our goal is to be substantially converted to 65-nanometer technology in Fab 36 by mid-2007. The additional capacity gained through the use of larger 300-millimeter wafers plays an important role in our growth plans for the next several years. We plan to add production output on a steady year-to-year basis, while also keeping fab utilization at consistently high levels. For 2006, we anticipate further growth in both annual net sales and market share. We believe critical success factors include our ability to: continue to increase market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, particularly by business enterprises, including small and medium businesses, as well as large enterprises, academic institutions and government institutions; strengthen our relationships with key customers and suppliers and establish relationships with new customers and suppliers that are industry leaders in their markets; successfully develop and transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies; ramp the production at Fab 36 and at a third-party foundry on a timely basis in response to market requirements; develop and introduce new products on a timely basis and achieve efficient and timely volume production of these products; extend our portfolio of x86 technology from the traditional PC and server markets into embedded applications in such markets as storage subsystems, networking and telephony equipment, handheld computing devices, computation and office equipment products, and consumer electronics; design and deliver products that meet the demands of consumers as digital content becomes increasingly used with a variety of connected digital devices; and continue to expand our participation in high-growth global markets. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenues, inventories, asset impairments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales and a provision for estimated future price reductions in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. 25 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near-term factory production planning. Generally, inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand for the next six months are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. To the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins, we would disclose them in our filings with the SEC. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results which also reduces the carrying basis of the related asset(s). The new carrying value of the related asset(s) is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset(s). We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. As of December 25, 2005, all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities are subject to a full valuation allowance, which was initially established in the fourth quarter of 2002. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 25, 2005, in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. In 2005, the valuation allowance increased primarily due to the continuation of start-up losses at Fab 36 in Germany net of utilization of valuation allowance as a result of operating profits in the U.S. If we in the future determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed, resulting in a benefit to our operating results. Such benefits would be recorded on the income tax (benefit) provision line of our statement of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations We review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income (loss) before interest, taxes and minority interest. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. Prior to the third quarter of 2003, we had two reportable segments: the Core Products segment, which consisted of the microprocessor, memory products and other IC products operating segments, and the Foundry Services segment, which consisted of fees for products sold to Vantis Corporation, our former programmable logic devices subsidiary, and Legerity Inc., our former voice communication products subsidiary. Effective June 30, 2003, we and Fujitsu executed agreements to integrate our Flash memory operations including our existing joint manufacturing venture, Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited, or FASL. FASL was contributed to a new entity, Spansion LLC (formerly known as FASL LLC), which was owned 60 percent by us and 40 percent by Fujitsu. As a result of this transaction, we began consolidating Spansion’s results of operations on June 30, 2003. Prior to June 30, 2003, we accounted for our share of FASL’s operating results under the equity method. As a result of the formation of Spansion LLC effective June 30, 2003, we reorganized our operating segments and created the following two reportable segments: • the Computation Products segment, which includes microprocessor products for desktop and mobile PCs, servers and workstations and chipset products; and • the Memory Products segment, which includes Spansion Flash memory products. In addition to our reportable segments, we also have the All Other category that is not a reportable segment. It includes several operating segments as well as certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of our operating segments because our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, or CODM, does not consider these operating expenses and credits in evaluating the operating performance of our operating segments. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we began presenting our Personal Connectivity Solutions operating segment as a separate reportable segment because this operating segment’s operating losses exceeded 10 percent of the combined operating income (loss) of all our operating segments. Therefore this operating segment became a reportable segment under the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 131 “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (SFAS 131). Previously, we included our Personal Connectivity Solutions operating segment in our All Other category. The Personal Connectivity Solutions segment includes primarily low-power, high-performance x86 and MIPS architecture-based embedded microprocessors and products for global commercial and consumer markets. Our All Other category also includes our PIC products, which were reviewed separately by our CODM beginning in the third quarter of 2005. PIC is not a reportable segment because the net operating results for the PIC operating segment constitute less than 10 percent of the combined operating income of all our operating segments. Prior to 2005, revenue from sales of PIC products was not material. As a result of Spansion’s IPO in December 2005 and, our deconsolidation of Spansion’s operating results effective December 21, 2005 discussed above, we allocated profit sharing and bonus expenses to the specific operating segments that earned them. Therefore, these expenses are no longer included in the All Other category. The results of operations for our operating segments presented and discussed in this section follow our segment structure discussed above, and all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year segment presentation. 27 Table of Contents As a result of Spansion’s IPO, our financial results of operations include Spansion’s financial results of operations as a consolidated subsidiary only through December 20, 2005. From December 21, 2005, Spansion’s operating results and financial position are not consolidated as part of our financial results. Instead, we applied the equity method of accounting to reflect our share of Spansion’s net income from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005. Accordingly, our operating results, including the segment operating results for the Memory Products segment, for the year ended December 25, 2005 are not fully comparable with our results for 2004. In addition, because prior to Spansion’s IPO we held a 60 percent controlling interest in Spansion, Fujitsu’s 40 percent share in the net income (loss) of Spansion was reflected as a minority interest adjustment to our consolidated financial statements through December 20, 2005. This minority interest adjustment does not correspond to operating income (loss) of our Memory Products segment because operating income (loss) for our Memory Products segment includes operations incremental to those of Spansion. Furthermore, the minority interest calculation is based on Spansion’s net income (loss) rather than operating income (loss). Prior to the formation of Spansion LLC on June 30, 2003, the results of operations for periods prior to June 30, 2003 did not include the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operations. Accordingly, the segment operating information for the Memory Products segment for the year ended December 26, 2004, is not fully comparable to the reclassified segment information for the prior period presented. We use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in December. The years ended December 25, 2005, December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, each included 52 weeks. References in this report to 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 shall refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. The following is a summary of our net sales and operating income (loss) by segment and category for 2005, 2004 and 2003. 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Net sales Computation Products Group $ 3,793 $ 2,528 $ 1,960 Memory Products Group 1,913 2,342 1,419 Personal Connectivity Solutions Group 136 131 140 All Other 6 — — Total Net Sales $ 5,848 5,001 3,519 Operating income (loss) Computation Products Group $ 617 $ 266 $ (32 ) Memory Products Group (311 ) 35 (190 ) Personal Connectivity Solutions Group (55 ) (54 ) (12 ) All Other (19 ) (25 ) 1 Total Operating Income (Loss) $ 232 $ 222 $ (233 ) Computation Products Group Net sales of our Computation Products of $3.8 billion for 2005 increased 50 percent compared to net sales of $2.5 billion for 2004 primarily due to an increase of 37 percent in unit shipments and an increase of nine percent in average selling prices. Unit shipments increased due to greater demand for desktop, mobile and server products across all geographic regions, particularly in North America and Greater China. In addition, our introduction of AMD Turion 64 processors for notebook PCs in March 2005, AMD Opteron dual-core processors for servers and workstations in April 2005 and AMD Athlon 64 dual-core processors for desktop PCs in May 2005 helped drive increasing customer adoption of our products. The increase in average selling prices was 28 Table of Contents primarily due to increased sales of our higher priced, high-performance AMD64-based processors which contributed to a richer product mix. Computation Products net sales of $2.5 billion in 2004 increased 29 percent compared to net sales of $2.0 billion in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 19 percent increase in average selling prices and a nine percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments. The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to increased sales of our higher-priced AMD64-based processors, particularly our AMD Athlon 64 processors, which contributed to a richer product mix. Similarly, the increase in unit shipments reflected the increased demand for these processors. Sales increased across all geographic regions, and growth was particularly strong in North America and Asia. Computation Products operating income of $617 million in 2005 increased by 132 percent compared to operating income of $266 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to a 50 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 36 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $914 million primarily due to a 37 percent increase in unit shipments, an increase of $205 million in research and development costs, and an increase of $110 million in marketing and cooperative advertising costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to an increase of $103 million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and a $96 million increase in Fab 36 start-up costs. Computation Products operating income of $266 million in 2004 increased by $298 million compared to an operating loss of $32 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 29 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 14 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of $79 million in connection with our AMD64-based processors, a nine percent increase in unit shipments, and a $28 million increase in research and development costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a $29 million increase in Fab 36 start-up costs and a $24 million increase in product design and engineering costs related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. Memory Products Group Memory Products net sales of $1.9 billion in 2005 decreased 18 percent compared to net sales of $2.3 billion in 2004. In 2005, we consolidated Spansion’s net sales into Memory Product net sales only through December 20, 2005. Therefore, approximately $104 million of Spansion’s net sales from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005 were excluded from Memory Products net sales in 2005. In addition, Memory Products net sales were adversely impacted due to a decrease of 28 percent in average selling prices in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by an increase of 14 percent in unit shipments in 2005 compared to 2004. Net sales for the Memory Products segment for 2005 are not fully comparable with net sales for 2004 because Spansion’s net sales are not consolidated with our net sales from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005. Memory Products net sales of $2.3 billion in 2004 increased 65 percent compared to net sales of $1.4 billion in 2003. The increase in total net sales was primarily due to the effect of consolidating Spansion’s results of operations, which included Spansion’s sales to Fujitsu of $1.1 billion for 12 months in 2004 compared to $449 million for the last six months of 2003, and also due to stronger market demand in 2004 than in 2003, particularly in the wireless category of the Flash memory market, which resulted in a nine percent increase in average selling prices. In the second half of 2003, demand for Flash memory products began to increase significantly, and this trend continued through the first half of 2004. In the second half of 2004, however, our Memory Products net sales declined due to aggressive pricing by competitors particularly in the embedded category of the Flash memory market, where competitors began to aggressively pursue increased market share, and aggregate Flash memory product supply exceeded demand. In particular, decreased demand from the wireless handset market in Asia, in part due to excess inventory accumulation by wireless handset OEMs in China during the first half of 2004, contributed to a decline in Memory Product net sales during the third quarter of 2004. In addition, a 29 Table of Contents downturn in the overall Flash memory market, lower than expected sales in the wireless handset market and delays in qualifying a product based on Spansion’s second-generation MirrorBit technology also contributed to a decline in net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004. Also, Memory Product net sales declined in the second half of 2004 compared with the first half of 2004 because Spansion was not able to meet demand for certain of lower density products for the embedded category of the Flash memory market in the first half of 2004, which we believe adversely impacted relationships with customers who did not receive allocations of these embedded products. Competitors were able to take advantage of this situation to increase their market share in the second half of 2004. Spansion was unable to meet demand for these products in the first half of 2004 because in 2003 it underestimated demand with respect to these products for the first half of 2004 and was unable to install additional wafer fabrication capacity on a timely basis. As a result, a significant number of end customers for lower density products were under-served, and these customers chose to rely on competitors both for product supply and for their design-in activities in the first half of 2004, resulting in an increased market share for those competitors in the second half of 2004 when those designs went into production. Further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between us and Fujitsu in connection with the initial formation of Spansion LLC as of June 30, 2003. Memory Products had an operating loss of $311 million in 2005 compared to operating income of $35 million in 2004. The decline in operating results was primarily due to a decrease in net sales of $430 million while the cost of sales only decreased $109 million. Net sales decreased as a result of a decrease of 28 percent in average selling prices in 2005 compared to 2004. Net sales for the Memory Products segment for 2005 are not fully comparable with net sales for 2004 because Spansion’s net sales are not consolidated with our net sales from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005. In addition, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $16 million during the fourth quarter of 2005. Goodwill in the amount of $16 million was generated on June 30, 2003 as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC, which we accounted for as a partial step acquisition and purchase business combination. In the fourth quarter of 2005, after considering the fact that the estimated fair value of Spansion was less than our carrying net book value and after comparing the estimated fair value of Spansion’s assets (other than goodwill) to our carrying net book value for such assets, we concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill is zero. Therefore, we wrote off the entire $16 million of recorded goodwill. Memory Products operating income of $35 million in 2004 increased $225 million from an operating loss of $190 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to the effect of consolidating Spansion’s results of operations, which include Spansion’s sales to Fujitsu, for 12 months in 2004 compared to six months in 2003. In addition, our manufacturing costs decreased due to our transition to 110-nanometer process technology for certain of our Flash memory products in 2004 and as a result of increased shipments of Flash memory products based on MirrorBit technology, which are less expensive to manufacture than Flash memory products based on floating gate technology. Further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operations with our financial results as of June 30, 2003. Personal Connectivity Solutions Group Personal Connectivity Solutions (PCS) net sales of $136 million in 2005 increased four percent compared to net sales of $131 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to $13 million increase in sales of AMD Geode products and $8 million increase in sales of embedded processors, partially offset by a $15 million decrease in sales of networking products and MIPS-architecture based products. PCS net sales of $131 million in 2004 decreased seven percent compared to net sales of $140 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a $43 million decrease in sales of certain end-of-life embedded microprocessors, partially offset by a $33 million increase in sales of AMD Geode products. We acquired the Geode product line from National Semiconductor in August 2003. Accordingly, the increase in sales of AMD Geode products in 2004 was due to the fact that in 2004 we had 12 months of sales whereas in 2003 we had approximately four months of sales. 30 Table of Contents PCS operating loss of $55 million in 2005 was flat compared to an operating loss of $54 million in 2004. The increase in net sales of $5 million from 2004 to 2005 was offset by an increase in operating expenses of $6 million. PCS operating loss of $54 million in 2004 increased compared to an operating loss of $12 million in 2003. The increase in the operating loss was primarily due to a $31 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due to an increase of approximately $23 million in manufacturing costs as a result of a change in product mix and an aggregate increase of $9 million in marketing, general and administrative expenses as a result of activities related to our AMD Geode products and other product development. Manufacturing costs increased primarily because we manufactured more AMD Geode products, which generally are more expensive to manufacture than our other embedded processors. All Other Category All Other net sales in 2005 were $6 million because of sales of PIC products. We did not generate any material sales from PIC products in 2004 or 2003. All Other operating loss of $19 million in 2005 decreased from $25 million in 2004, primarily due to restructuring and other special charges of $5 million incurred during 2004 due to a change in our estimate of potential sublease revenue. All Other operating loss in 2004 was $25 million compared to operating income of $1 million in 2003. We incurred an operating loss in 2004, primarily due to operating expenses associated with developing and marketing PIC products. In addition, All Other operating loss in 2004 included approximately $5 million of restructuring and other special charges due to a change in our estimate of potential sublease revenue, while in 2003 we had a $14 million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge primarily because we reduced the estimate of the numbers of positions to be eliminated in response to the additional resources required due to the Spansion LLC transaction and reversed the associated severance and fringe benefit accrual. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net, Interest Expense, Income Taxes and Other Expenses The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for years ended December 25, 2005, December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003: 2005 2004 2003 (In millions except forpercentages) Cost of sales $ 3,456 $ 3,033 $ 2,327 Gross margin percentage 41 % 39 % 34 % Research and development $ 1,144 $ 935 $ 852 Marketing, general and administrative 1,016 807 587 Restructuring and other special charges (recoveries), net — 5 (14 ) Interest income and other income (expense), net 14 (31 ) 21 Interest expense 105 112 110 Loss on dilution of equity interest in Spansion Inc. 110 — — Income tax (benefit) provision (7 ) 6 3 Gross Margin Gross margin percentage increased to 41 percent in 2005 compared to 39 percent in 2004. The improvement in gross margin percentage was primarily due to microprocessor net sales, which comprised a greater percentage of total net sales in 2005 as compared to 2004. Microprocessor net sales carried a higher gross margin than Flash 31 Table of Contents memory net sales. In addition, the improvement in gross margin was due to a 1.5 percent increase in gross margin for Computation Products. Computation Products margin improved as a result of a nine percent increase in average selling prices discussed above, partially offset by increased manufacturing costs caused by the shift in our product mix to higher-end microprocessor products. Gross margin also improved because we were better able to absorb our fixed manufacturing costs due in part to improving yields at Fab 30. The improvement in gross margin was partially offset by a 12 percent decrease in gross margin for Memory Products due primarily to a decrease of 28 percent in average selling prices in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by an increase of 14 percent in unit shipments in 2005 compared to 2004. Gross margin percentage increased to 39 percent in 2004 compared to 34 percent in 2003. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of 42 percent and lower unit manufacturing costs resulting from our transition to smaller, more cost efficient manufacturing process technologies for both microprocessors and Flash memory products. Further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansion’s operating results as of June 30, 2003. We record grants and allowances that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 or Fab 36, and we recorded the interest subsidies we received for Fab 30, as long-term liabilities on our financial statements. We amortize these amounts as they are earned as a reduction to operating expenses. We record the amortization of the production related grants and allowances as a credit to cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $72 million in 2005, $67 million in 2004 and $46 million in 2003. The fluctuations in the recognition of these credits have not significantly impacted our gross margins. In 2005 and 2004 we capitalized construction and facilitization costs related to Fab 36. Once Fab 36 begins producing revenue-generating products, which we anticipate will be in the first quarter of 2006, we will begin depreciating these costs to cost of sales. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $1,144 million in 2005 increased 22 percent from $935 million in 2004 due primarily to an increase of $103 million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and increased start-up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of $96 million. Research and development expenses of $935 million in 2004 increased ten percent from $852 million in 2003 due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of Spansion LLC’s results of operations with our results of operations effective June 30, 2003, increased start-up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of approximately $29 million and a $24 million increase in product design and engineering costs for new generations of our microprocessors. These factors were partially offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. We record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances as well as the research and development subsidies as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $44 million in 2005, $21 million in 2004 and $29 million in 2003. 32 Table of Contents Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $1,016 million in 2005 increased 26 percent compared to $807 million in 2004, primarily due to an increase of $110 million in marketing and cooperative advertising costs and other expenses related to the 17 percent increase in revenue in 2005 compared to 2004. In addition, in 2005 we wrote off goodwill of $16 million, which was originally recorded in 2003, as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $807 million in 2004 increased 37 percent compared to $587 million in 2003, primarily due to increased sales and cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of $112 million primarily associated with our AMD 64-based processors, expenses from Spansion of $153 million for 12 months of 2004 compared to $78 million for six months in 2003 and new regulatory compliance costs of $15 million. Effects of 2002 Restructuring Plan In December 2002, we began implementing a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry-wide excess inventory. The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities currently occupied under long-term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs. With the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities net of estimated sublease income that are payable through 2011, we have completed the activities associated with the 2002 Restructuring Plan. The following table summarizes activities under the 2002 Restructuring Plan through December 25, 2005: SeveranceandEmployeeBenefits AssetImpairment FacilityExit andEquipmentDecommissionCosts OtherRestructuringCharges Total (In thousands) Accruals at December 29, 2002 $ 54,420 $ — $ 138,105 $ 4,315 $ 196,840 2003 Provision — 7,791 3,314 — 11,105 Cash payments (38,816 ) — (20,796 ) (4,300 ) (63,912 ) Non-cash charges — (7,791 ) — — (7,791 ) Non-cash adjustments (8,864 ) — — (15 ) (8,879 ) Accruals at December 28, 2003 $ 6,740 $ — $ 120,623 $ — $ 127,363 Cash payments (6,789 ) — (20,150 ) — (26,939 ) Non-cash adjustments 49 — 5,203 — 5,252 Accruals at December 26, 2004 $ — $ — $ 105,676 $ — $ 105,676 Cash payments — — (20,773 ) — (20,773 ) Accruals at December 25, 2005 $ — $ — $ 84,903 $ — $ 84,903 33 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Interest income $ 37,210 $ 18,013 $ 19,702 Other income (expense), net (23,639 ) (49,163 ) 1,414 $ 13,571 $ (31,150 ) $ 21,116 We recorded a net income of interest income and other income (expense), net of $14 million in 2005 compared to a net expense of approximately $31 million in 2004, an increase of $45 million. This increase was due primarily to a decrease in other expense, net from $49 million in 2004, the components of which are discussed below, to $24 million in 2005. The $24 million of other expense, net in 2005 consisted primarily of a loss of approximately $10 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 resulting from the mark-to-market to earnings of certain foreign currency forward contracts which became ineffective in hedging against certain forecasted foreign currency transactions that are now not expected to occur due to the change of functional currency for AMD Fab 36 KG from the euro to the U.S. dollar and approximately $14 million of commitment and guarantee fees incurred in connection with the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. In addition, interest income increased approximately $19 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 135 percent increase in average interest rates and an increase in our average cash balances. We recorded a net expense of interest income and other income (expense), net, of $31 million in 2004 compared to a net income of approximately $21 million in 2003. This expense in 2004 was due primarily to a charge of approximately $32 million related to a series of transactions pursuant to which we exchanged $201 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) for our common stock. The charge represented the difference between the fair value of the common stock issued in the transactions and the fair value of common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the 4.50% Notes. In addition, interest income and other income (expense), net, in 2004 included a charge of approximately $14 million in connection with our prepayment of the term loan agreement between our German subsidiary, AMD Saxony Limited Liability Company & Co. KG and a consortium of banks in order to finance Fab 30, or the Fab 30 Term Loan, and a loss of approximately $6 million during the second quarter of 2004 resulting from the mark-to-market to earnings of certain foreign currency forward contracts that we used as economic hedges of forecasted capital contributions to AMD Fab 36 KG, which do not qualify as accounting hedges. Interest income was flat in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest Expense Interest expense of $105 million in 2005 decreased six percent compared to $112 million in 2004. In 2004, interest expense included approximately $26 million of interest under the Fab 30 Term Loan. Because we prepaid this loan on November 2, 2004, we did not incur any interest in connection with this loan in 2005. In addition, interest expense incurred on our 4.50% Notes was $9 million in 2005 compared with $19 million in 2004 because the holders of an aggregate principal amount of $201.5 million of these notes converted their notes into our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2005, and we exchanged an aggregate principal amount of $200 million of these notes in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of 2004 for shares of our common stock. Also, during 2005, we capitalized interest of $35 million in connection with Fab 36 construction activities in Dresden, Germany, compared with $9 million in 2004. Partially offsetting these decreases in interest expense was the higher interest expense of $48 million incurred in connection with our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 (the 7.75% Notes), which we sold on October 29, 2004, compared with $8 million in 2004 and interest expense incurred pursuant to capital leases which increased by approximately $10 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Interest expense of $112 million in 2004 was approximately flat compared to $110 million in 2003. Interest accrued on the 7.75% Notes during 2004 was partially offset by the absence of interest expense, as of November 2, 2004, for amounts outstanding under the Fab 30 Term Loan, and the absence of interest expense 34 Table of Contents with respect to $201 million of our 4.50% Notes, which we exchanged for our common stock in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, we capitalized interest during 2004 of $9 million in connection with our Fab 36 construction activities. Loss on Dilution of Equity Interest in Spansion Inc. Prior to the Spansion IPO, we held a 60 percent controlling ownership interest in Spansion, and Spansion’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours. Consequently, Spansion’s results of operations through December 20, 2005 have been included in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. Following Spansion’s IPO, our ownership interest was diluted from 60 percent to 37.9 percent and we no longer exercise control over Spansion. As a result, from December 21, 2005, the closing date of the IPO, through December 25, 2005 we used the equity method of accounting to reflect our investment in Spansion, and we no longer consolidated Spansion’s financial position, operating results or cash flows with ours. This will continue in 2006. In connection with the reduction of our ownership interest in Spansion, we recorded a loss of $110 million. This loss represents the difference between Spansion’s book value per share before and after the IPO multiplied by the number of shares of Spansion’s common stock owned by us. As of December 25, 2005, we evaluated the carrying value of our investment in Spansion and concluded that, based on the relevant factors, there was no “other than temporary” impairment of the investment. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 18 (as amended), “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” if future factors indicate that a decline in the fair value of the investment is other than temporary, we would recognize a loss on our investment at that time. To the extent that our ownership in Spansion decreases in the future whether it is caused by disposal of our ownership interest or by Spansion’s issuance of additional common stock, we would record either a gain or a loss on such further dilution depending on Spansion’s book value and fair value at that time, which could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which this ownership dilution occurs. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax benefit of $7 million in 2005 and income tax provisions of $6 million in 2004 and $3 million in 2003. The income tax benefit in 2005 primarily reflects U.S. tax benefits realized from the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits and foreign tax benefits generated by Spansion in certain foreign jurisdictions. Spansion’s IPO did not have a material impact on our tax provision. The income tax provision in 2004 primarily reflects U.S. income taxes, including taxes on the dividends repatriated from controlled foreign corporations, partially offset by foreign tax benefits because of losses in various foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2003 primarily reflected income tax expense generated in various foreign jurisdictions, offset by a benefit of a U.S. federal tax refund from a carryback claim we filed in 2003. As of December 25, 2005, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $67 million and $90 million. We also had foreign loss carryforwards of approximately $428 million. In addition, we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $274 million and $95 million. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards subject to expiration will expire at various dates beginning in 2006 through 2025, if not utilized. We maintain a full valuation allowance against all our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets ($741 million at December 25, 2005) because of our prior history of losses. International Sales International sales as a percent of net sales were 79 percent in 2005, 79 percent in 2004 and 80 percent in 2003. During 2005 and 2004, approximately 14 and 22 percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen. However, as a result of the closing of Spansion’s IPO on December 21, 2005, we do not expect to have significant sales denominated in the Japanese yen in the future. 35 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 25, 2005 totaled $1.8 billion. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion in 2005. Net income of $165 million, adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, a non-cash charge of approximately $110 million that we incurred as a result of the dilution of our ownership in Spansion from 60 percent to 37.9 percent as a result of Spansion’s IPO, and a non-cash charge of $16 million in connection with our write-off of goodwill that was generated as of June 30, 2003 as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC, contributed to the positive cash flows from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2005 compared to 2004 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and decreased inventories due primarily to the deconsolidation of Spansion’s results of operations from ours as a result of Spansion’s IPO. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.1 billion in 2004. Net income of $91 million, adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $32 million associated with our exchange of $201 million of our 4.50% Notes for common stock in the fourth quarter of 2004, contributed to the positive cash flows from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2004 as compared to 2003 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales, and increased inventories due primarily to an increase in microprocessor inventories resulting from a higher percentage of AMD64-based processors and improved market conditions. For 2004, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 23 percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately 22 percent of our consolidated gross sales. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $296 million in 2003. Although we had a net loss of $274 million for the year, adjustments for non-cash charges, which were primarily depreciation and amortization, resulted in a positive cash flow from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2003 as compared to 2002 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operations, which include Spansion’s sales to Fujitsu, and an increase in net inventory due to the consolidation of Spansion’s results of operations. For 2003, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 31 percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately 13 percent of our consolidated gross sales. In 2003, the net changes in payables and accrued liabilities primarily included payments of $90 million for a technology license from IBM and approximately $64 million of payments under the 2002 Restructuring Plan. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion in 2005, primarily as a result of $1.5 billion used to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $726 million used to construct Fab 36, and a net cash outflow of $726 million from maturities and purchases of available-for-sale securities, including a purchase of $175 million aggregate principal amount of Spansion’s 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2016 (Spansion Senior Notes) for approximately $158.9 million, partially offset by $261 million in proceeds from Spansion’s repayment of amounts outstanding under promissory notes to us and $133 million cash decrease due to the deconsolidation of Spansion’s results of operations from ours. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2004, primarily as a result of $1.4 billion used to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $569 million used to construct Fab 36, and a net cash outflow of $150 million from maturities and purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by $34 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $83 million in 2003, primarily as a result of net cash proceeds of $482 million from maturities and purchases of available-for-sale securities, $148 million of cash acquired in conjunction with the Spansion transaction and $30 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, offset by $570 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment. 36 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $494 million in 2005. This amount included $186 million in proceeds from borrowings by Spansion and $60 million of silent partnership contributions from the unaffiliated partners of AMD Fab 36 KG which we classify as debt, $189 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options, $163 million of capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project, $129 million of proceeds from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by Spansion, and approximately $90 million in investments from the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG. These amounts were offset by $316 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $413 million in 2004. This amount included $745 million of proceeds from financing activities, including $588 million in proceeds, net of $13 million in debt issuance costs, from the issuance of our 7.75% Notes, approximately $250 million in investments from the non-affiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, $60 million of proceeds from equipment sale and leaseback transactions, $30 million of capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project, $124 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options and the elimination of our $224 million compensating cash balance due to the prepayment of our Fab 30 Term Loan. These amounts were offset by $898 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, including approximately $647 million used to prepay amounts outstanding under the Fab 30 Term Loan, including accrued and unpaid interest. Net cash provided by financing activities was $267 million in 2003, primarily due to $245 million received from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by Spansion, a $40 million cash note to Spansion from Fujitsu as part of the formation of Spansion LLC as of June 30, 2003, $155 million of capital investment allowances received from the Federal Republic of Germany for the Fab 30 project and $35 million of proceeds from issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options, offset by $141 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and a $74 million increase in our compensating cash balance, which represented the minimum cash balance that AMD Saxony was required to maintain in order to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant set forth in the Fab 30 Term Loan. Purchase of Spansion LLC 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 On December 21, 2005, Spansion LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spansion Inc., issued to us $175 million aggregate principal amount of the Spansion Senior Notes. We purchased the Spansion Senior Notes for approximately $158.9 million in cash, or 90.828% of face value. The Spansion Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of Spansion LLC and will rank junior to any existing and future senior debt of Spansion Inc. or Spansion LLC. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year beginning April 15, 2006 until the maturity date of April 15, 2016. Spansion LLC’s obligations under the Spansion Senior Notes are guaranteed by Spansion Inc., Spansion Technology Inc., a subsidiary of Spansion Inc., and any restricted subsidiary of Spansion that guarantees any of Spansion’s public debt in the future. Because we can sell these notes to a third party in a private transaction, and we intend to sell them in 2006, we classified these notes as short-term investments. Liquidity We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances, together with available external financing, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital investments in the short term and long term, including the estimated additional $1.6 billion in capital expenditures that we plan to incur for the Fab 36 project from 2006 through 2008. See “Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements,” below. Should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an 37 Table of Contents effective registration statement; through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933; or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 On November 25, 2002, we issued $402.5 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) in a registered offering. Interest on the 4.50% Notes was payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2003. Beginning on December 4, 2005, the 4.50% Notes were redeemable by us at our option for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that we were not able to redeem the 4.50% Notes unless the last reported sale price of our common stock was at least 150 percent of the then-effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we exchanged $201 million of the 4.50% Notes into shares of our common stock in a series of transactions. As a result of these exchange transactions, we recognized a charge of approximately $32 million, which represented the difference between the fair value of the shares issued in the transactions and the fair value of shares issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the 4.50% Notes. During the fourth quarter of 2005, holders of the remaining 4.50% Notes elected to convert their 4.50% Notes into shares of our common stock. Accordingly, as of December 25, 2005 the 4.50% Notes were no longer outstanding. Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees The following table summarizes our principal contractual cash obligations at December 25, 2005, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table. Because of the closing of Spansion’s IPO on December 21, 2005, we no longer include Spansion’s contractual cash obligations in the table below. Principal contractual cash obligations at December 25, 2005 were: Total Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 and beyond (In thousands) 4.75% Convertible (1)Debentures $ 500,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 500,000 7.75% Notes (2) 600,000 — — — — — 600,000 Repurchase Obligations to Fab 36 Partners (3) 151,924 37,981 37,981 37,981 37,981 — — AMD Penang Term Loan 4,831 1,525 1,526 1,526 254 — — Capital Lease Obligations 113,534 3,718 4,193 4,686 5,082 5,784 90,071 Other Long-term Liabilities 66,288 — 17,649 17,892 14,986 14,958 803 Operating Leases (4) 325,530 50,826 47,738 43,942 36,124 32,953 113,947 Unconditional Purchase Commitments (4)(5) 1,388,504 490,391 279,200 226,819 62,804 56,183 273,107 Total principal contractual cash obligations $ 3,150,611 $ 584,441 $ 388,287 $ 332,846 $ 157,231 $ 109,878 $ 1,577,928 (1) On January 12, 2006, we sent a notice of redemption to the holders of our 4.75% Debentures with a redemption date of February 6, 2006. Prior to the redemption date, holders of the 4.75% Debentures elected 38 Table of Contents to convert their 4.75% Debentures into 21,378,605 shares of our common stock pursuant to the original terms of the 4.75% Debentures. (2) On January 27, 2006, we sent a notice of redemption to the holders of the 7.75% Notes with a redemption date of February 26, 2006, for the redemption of 35 percent (or $210 million) of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes. On February 27, 2006, the holders of the redeemed 7.75% Notes received 107.75 percent of the principal amount of the redeemed 7.75% Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. (3) This amount represents the amount of silent partnership contributions that we are required to repurchase from the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG. See “Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements,” below. (4) Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (5) We have unconditional purchase commitments for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume or purchase commitment in the table above. 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 On January 29, 2002 we issued $500 million of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2022 (the 4.75% Debentures) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The 4.75% Debentures were convertible by the holders into our common stock at a conversion price of $23.38 per share at any time. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures is convertible into approximately 43 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $14 million are amortized ratably, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the 4.75% Debentures, as interest expense. As of February 5, 2006, the 4.75% Debentures became redeemable by us for cash at our option at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price as a Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on February 5, 2005 through February 4, 2006 102.375 % Beginning on February 5, 2006 through February 4, 2007 101.583 % Beginning on February 5, 2007 through February 4, 2008 100.792 % Beginning on February 5, 2008 100.000 % On January 12, 2006, we sent a notice of redemption to the holders of the 4.75% Debentures, with a redemption date of February 6, 2006. Prior to the redemption date, holders of the 4.75% Debentures elected to convert their debentures into 21,378,605 shares of our common stock pursuant to the original terms of the 4.75% Debentures. Accordingly, as of February 6, 2006, the 4.75% Debentures were no longer outstanding. 39 Table of Contents 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 On October 29, 2004, we issued $600 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On April 22, 2005, we exchanged these notes for publicly registered notes which have substantially identical terms as the old notes except that the publicly registered notes (the 7.75% Notes) are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and, therefore, do not contain legends restricting their transfer. The 7.75% Notes mature on November 1, 2012. Interest on the 7.75% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, beginning May 1, 2005. Prior to November 1, 2008, we may redeem some or all of the 7.75% Notes at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a “make-whole” premium, as defined in the agreement. Thereafter, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price as Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on November 1, 2008 through October 31, 2009 103.875 % Beginning on November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010 101.938 % Beginning on November 1, 2010 through October 31, 2011 100.000 % On November 1, 2011 100.000 % In addition, on or prior to November 1, 2007, we may redeem up to 35 percent of the 7.75% Notes with the proceeds of certain sales of our equity securities at 107.75 percent of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 7.75% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.75% Notes at a repurchase price of 101 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the 7.75% Notes contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, which include all of our subsidiaries from: • incurring additional indebtedness; • paying dividends and making other restricted payments; • making certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; • creating or permitting certain liens; • creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • using the proceeds from sales of assets; • entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidating, merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. Issuance costs incurred in connection with this transaction in the amount of approximately $13 million will be amortized ratably over the term of the 7.75% Notes as interest expense, approximating the effective interest method. We anticipate that approximately $4 million will be charged to interest income and other income (expense), net as a result of redemption described below. On January 27, 2006, we sent a notice of redemption to the holders of the 7.75% Notes, with a redemption date of February 26, 2006, for the redemption of 35 percent (or $210 million) of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 7.75% Notes. On February 27, 2006, the holders of the redeemed 7.75% Notes received 40 Table of Contents 107.75 percent of the principal amount of the redeemed 7.75% Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In connection with this redemption, we expect to incur a loss of approximately $20 million, which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2006. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 7.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements Our new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36, is located in Dresden, Germany adjacent to our other wafer manufacturing facility, Fab 30. Fab 36 is owned by AMD Fab 36 KG, a German limited partnership. We control the management of AMD Fab 36 KG through a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 LLC, which is a general partner of AMD Fab 36 KG. AMD Fab 36 KG is our indirect consolidated subsidiary. Fab 36 will produce advanced microprocessor products, and we expect first production shipments of products manufactured using 300-millimeter wafers in the first quarter of 2006. To date, we have provided the majority of financing for the Fab 36 project. In addition, Leipziger Messe GmbH, a nominee of the State of Saxony, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH, an investment consortium arranged by M+W Zander Facility Engineering GmbH, the general contractor for the project, and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are limited partners in AMD Fab 36 KG. We also anticipate receiving up to approximately $644 million in grants and allowances from federal and state German authorities for the Fab 36 project. We expect that capital expenditures for Fab 36 from 2006 through 2008 will be approximately $1.6 billion in the aggregate. The funding to construct and facilitize Fab 36 consists of: • equity contributions from us of $694 million under the partnership agreements, revolving loans from us of up to approximately $890 million, and guarantees from us for amounts owed by AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliates to the lenders and unaffiliated limited partners; • investments of up to approximately $380 million from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs; • loans of up to approximately $831 million from a consortium of banks; • up to approximately $644 million of subsidies consisting of grants and allowances, from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony; depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG, of which $198 million of cash has been received as of December 25, 2005; and • a loan guarantee from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders referenced above after foreclosure on all other security. As of December 25, 2005, we had contributed to AMD Fab 36 KG the full amount of equity required under the partnership agreements and no loans were outstanding. These amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. On April 21, 2004, AMD, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD that owns substantially all of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, and AMD Fab 36 Admin GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD Fab 36 Holding that owns the remainder of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, (collectively referred to as the AMD companies) entered into a series of agreements (the partnership agreements) with the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, relating to the rights and obligations with respect to their limited partner and silent partner contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG. The 41 Table of Contents partnership has been established for an indefinite period of time. A partner may terminate its participation in the partnership by giving twelve months advance notice to the other partners. The termination becomes effective at the end of the year following the year during which the notice is given. However, other than for good cause, a partner’s termination will not be effective before December 31, 2015. Also on April 21, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG entered into a term loan agreement and other related agreements (the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate Fab 36. The consortium of banks agreed to make available up to $831 million in loans to AMD Fab 36 KG upon its achievement of specified milestones, including attainment of “technical completion” at Fab 36, which requires certification by the banks’ technical advisor that AMD Fab 36 KG has a wafer fabrication process suitable for high-volume production of advanced microprocessors and has achieved specified levels of average wafer starts per week and average wafer yields, as well as cumulative capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion. Although AMD Fab 36 KG attained these milestones in January 2006, several conditions must still be fulfilled before AMD Fab 36 KG can draw on the loans. We anticipate that these conditions will be fulfilled in 2006. The amounts borrowed under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements are repayable in quarterly installments commencing in September 2007 and terminating in March 2011. AMD Fab 36 KG pledged substantially all of its current and future assets as security under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, we pledged our equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding pledged its equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Admin and its partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG and AMD Fab 36 Admin and AMD Fab 36 LLC pledged all of their partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG. We guaranteed the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. We also guaranteed repayment of grants and allowances by AMD Fab 36 KG, should such repayment be required pursuant to the terms of the subsidies provided by the federal and state German authorities. Pursuant to the terms of the guarantee, we have to comply with specified adjusted tangible net worth and EBITDA financial covenants if the sum of our and our subsidiaries’ cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, less the amount outstanding under any third-party revolving credit facility or term loan agreement with an original maturity date for amounts borrowed of up to one year (group consolidated cash), declines below the following amounts: Amount (in thousands) if Moody’s Rating is at least if Standard & Poor’s Rating is at least $500,000 B1 or lower and B+ or lower 425,000 Ba3 and BB- 400,000 Ba2 and BB 350,000 Ba1 and BB+ 300,000 Baa3 or better and BBB-or better As of December 25, 2005, group consolidated cash was greater than $500 million, and therefore, the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. The partnership agreements set forth each limited partner’s aggregate capital contribution to AMD Fab 36 KG and the milestones for such contributions. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, AMD, through AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, agreed to provide an aggregate of $694 million, Leipziger Messe agreed to provide an aggregate of $237 million and Fab 36 Beteiligungs agreed to provide an aggregate of $143 million. The capital contributions of Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are comprised of limited partnership contributions and silent partnership contributions. These contributions are due at various dates upon the achievement of milestones relating to the construction and operation of Fab 36. As of December 25, 2005, all capital contributions were made in full. The partnership agreements also specify that the unaffiliated limited partners will receive a guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent per annum on their total investment depending upon the monthly wafer output of Fab 36. We guaranteed these payments by AMD Fab 36 KG. 42 Table of Contents In April 2005, we amended the partnership agreements in order to restructure the proportion of Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership and limited partnership contributions. Although the total aggregate amount that Leipziger Messe has agreed to provide remained unchanged, the portion of its contribution that constitutes limited partnership interests was reduced by $59 million while the portion of its contribution that constitutes silent partnership interests was increased by a corresponding amount. In this report, we refer to this additional silent partnership contribution as the New Silent Partnership Amount. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements and subject to the prior consent of the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin have a call option over the limited partnership interests held by Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, first exercisable three and one-half years after the relevant partner has completed the applicable capital contribution and every three years thereafter. Also, commencing five years after completion of the relevant partner’s capital contribution, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs each have the right to sell their limited partnership interest to third parties (other than competitors), subject to a right of first refusal held by AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, or to put their limited partnership interest to AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The put option is thereafter exercisable every three years. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs also have a put option in the event they are outvoted at AMD Fab 36 KG partners’ meetings with respect to certain specified matters such as increases in the partners’ capital contributions beyond those required by the partnership agreements, investments significantly in excess of the business plan, or certain dispositions of the limited partnership interests of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The purchase price under the put option is the partner’s capital account balance plus accumulated or accrued profits due to such limited partner. The purchase price under the call option is the same amount, plus a premium of $4.2 million to Leipziger Messe and a premium of $2.5 million to Fab 36 Beteiligungs. The right of first refusal price is the lower of the put option price or the price offered by the third party that triggered the right. We guaranteed the payments under the put options. In addition, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are obligated to repurchase the silent partnership interest of Leipziger Messe’s and Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ contributions over time. This mandatory repurchase obligation does not apply to the New Silent Partnership Amount. Specifically, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are required to repurchase Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership interest of $95 million in annual 25 percent installments commencing in December 2006, and Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ silent partnership interest of $71 million in annual 20 percent installments commencing in October 2005. On September 30, 2005, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin repurchased $14 million of Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ silent partnership contributions. For accounting and financial reporting purposes under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we initially classified the portion of the silent partnership contribution that is mandatorily redeemable as debt at its fair value at the time of issuance because of the mandatory redemption features described in the prior paragraph. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this debt towards our ultimate redemption value of the silent partnership contributions by the guaranteed annual rate of return of between 11 percent to 13 percent. We record this periodic accretion to redemption value as interest expense. The limited partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 KG received from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs and the New Silent Partnership Portion described above are not mandatorily redeemable, but rather are subject to redemption outside of the control of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. Upon consolidation, we initially record these contributions as minority interest, based on their fair value. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this minority interest toward our ultimate redemption value of these contributions by the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We classify this periodic accretion of redemption value as an additional minority interest allocation. No separate accounting is required for the put and call options because they are not freestanding instruments and not considered derivatives under SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” 43 Table of Contents As of December 25, 2005, AMD Fab 36 KG had received $166 million of silent partnership contributions and $214 million of limited partnership contributions, which includes a New Silent Partnership Amount of $59 million, from the unaffiliated limited partners. These contributions were recorded as debt and minority interest, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In addition to support from us and the consortium of banks referred to above, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony have agreed to support the Fab 36 project in the form of: • a loan guarantee equal to 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders after foreclosure on all other security; and • subsidies consisting of grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $644 million, depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG. In connection with the receipt of subsidies for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2007 and maintain this headcount through December 2012. We record the subsidies as long-term liabilities on our financial statements and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2012. Currently, we amortize the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. At such time as Fab 36 begins producing revenue-generating products, which is expected to be in the first quarter of 2006, we will amortize these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, we will amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the equipment, starting from the first quarter of 2006 because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments in equipment. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy grant documents could result in forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. As of December 25, 2005, AMD Fab 36 KG had received cash allowances of $68 million for capital investments made in 2003 and 2004 as well as cash grants of $130 million for capital investments made in 2003 and 2004 and a prepayment for capital investments planned in 2005 and the first half of 2006. The Fab 36 Loan Agreements also require that we: • provide funding to AMD Fab 36 KG if cash shortfalls occur, including funding shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any defaults caused by AMD Fab 36 KG or its affiliates; and • guarantee 100 percent of AMD Fab 36 KG’s obligations under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements until the loans are repaid in full. Under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are generally prevented from paying dividends or making other payments to us. In addition, AMD Fab 36 KG would be in default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements if we or any of the AMD companies fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if, after the occurrence of the event, the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is adversely affected. Circumstances that could result in a default include: • our failure to provide loans to AMD Fab 36 KG as required under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • failure to pay any amount due under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements within five days of the due date; • occurrence of any event which the lenders reasonably believe has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets or condition of AMD Fab 36 KG or AMD or their ability to perform under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Fab 36 KG or any limited partner; • occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) of AMD; 44 Table of Contents • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on payment of profits, dividends or other distributions except in limited circumstances and restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, disposing of assets and repaying subordinated debt; and • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain financial covenants, including minimum tangible net worth, minimum interest cover ratio, loan to fixed asset value ratio and a minimum cash covenant. In general, any default with respect to other indebtedness of AMD or AMD Fab 36 KG that is not cured, would result in a cross-default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. The occurrence of a default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. In addition, the occurrence of a default under these agreements could result in a cross-default under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. Generally, the amounts under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements and the partnership agreements are denominated in euros. However, we report these amounts in U.S. dollars, which are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate at December 25, 2005, of 0.843 euro to one U.S. dollar, to translate the amounts denominated in euros into U.S. dollars. However, with respect to amounts of equity contributions or partnership contributions, investment grants, allowances and subsidies received by AMD Fab 36 KG through December 25, 2005, we used the historical exchange rates that were in effect at the time AMD Fab 36 KG received these amounts to convert amounts denominated in euros into U.S. dollars. AMD Penang Term Loan On January 29, 2004, our subsidiary in Malaysia, AMD Export Sdn. Bhd., or AMD Penang, entered into a term loan agreement with a local financial institution. Under the terms of the loan agreement, AMD Penang can borrow up to 30 million Malaysian Ringgit (approximately $8 million as of December 25, 2005) in order to fund the purchase of equipment. The loan bears a fixed annual interest rate of 5.9 percent and is payable in equal, consecutive, monthly principal and interest installments through February 2009. The total amount outstanding as of December 25, 2005 was approximately $5 million. This loan was transferred to Spansion Penang in January 2006 by novation of the outstanding amounts, and therefore, this loan is no longer outstanding. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 25, 2005, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $114 million. These capital lease obligations primarily represent obligations under certain energy supply contracts which AMD Fab 36 KG entered into with local energy suppliers to provide Fab 36 with utilities (gas, electricity, heating and cooling) to meet the energy demand for our manufacturing needs. We accounted for certain fixed payments due under these energy supply arrangements as capital leases pursuant to EITF 01-8, “Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease” and SFAS 13, “Accounting for Leases.” These capital lease obligations are payable in monthly installments through 2020. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2021. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Our total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 25, 2005, were $326 million, of which $91 million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. 45 Table of Contents Unconditional Purchase Commitments Total non-cancelable purchase commitments as of December 25, 2005, were $1.4 billion for periods through 2020. These purchase commitments include $559 million related to contractual obligations of Fab 30 and Fab 36 to purchase silicon-on-insulator wafers and purchases of energy and gas and up to $226 million representing future payments to IBM pursuant to our joint development agreement. As IBM’s services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, we expense the payments as incurred. In August 2005, we amended this agreement, and among other things, extended its termination date through December 2011. However, capital purchases by IBM necessary for the continued development of process development projects past December 31, 2008 are conditioned upon the approval of IBM’s board of directors. If such approval is not received by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. Accordingly, the table above only reflects our obligations through December 31, 2008. If such approval is received from IBM, the additional obligations from January 2009 through 2011 would be between $276 million and $306 million. In addition, unconditional purchase commitments also include $107 million for software maintenance agreements that require periodic payments through 2009. The remaining commitments primarily consist of non-cancelable contractual obligations to purchase raw materials, natural resources and office supplies. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable without significant penalties are not included in the amount set forth in the table above. Other Long-Term Liabilities One component of Other Long-Term Liabilities that requires us to make cash payments is a net restructuring accrual of $66 million relating to the net future operating lease payments on certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We will make these payments through 2011. We included these amounts in the operating lease total in the table above. The other components of Other Long-Term Liabilities do not require us to make cash payments and primarily consist of $342 million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the Fab 30 and Fab 36 projects and a $20 million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our corporate marketing, general and administrative facility in Sunnyvale, California in 1998. Guarantees Guarantees of Indebtedness Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 25, 2005 related to underlying liabilities that are already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2005 and their expected expiration dates by year. No incremental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for these guarantees. For more information on these guarantees, see “Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees,” above.

(2) Amount of the guarantee diminishes as the rent is paid. (3) Notwithstanding the Spansion IPO, we agreed to maintain our guarantees of these Spansion obligations. AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co., KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by us, Infineon Technologies AG and DuPont Photomasks, Inc. for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. In April 2005 DuPont Photomasks, Inc. was acquired by Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Toppan, named Toppan Photomasks, Inc. We procure advanced photomasks from AMTC and use them in manufacturing our microprocessors. To finance the project, BAC and AMTC entered into a $142 million revolving credit facility and a $89 million term loan in December 2002. Also in December 2002, in order to occupy the photomask facility, AMTC entered into a rental agreement with BAC. With regard to these commitments by BAC and AMTC, as of December 25, 2005, we guaranteed up to $38 million plus interest and expenses under the revolving loan, and up to $19 million, initially, under the rental agreement. The obligations under the rental agreement guarantee diminish over time through 2011 as the term loan is repaid. However, under certain circumstances of default by the other tenant of the photomask facility under its rental agreement with BAC and certain circumstances of default by more than one joint venture partner under its rental agreement guarantee obligations, the maximum potential amount of our obligations under the rental agreement guarantee is $119 million. As of December 25, 2005, $83 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility, and $57 million was drawn under the term loan. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the guarantees because they were issued prior to December 31, 2002, the effective date of FIN 45. Spansion Japan Term Loan Guarantee As a result of the formation of Spansion LLC on June 30, 2003, the third-party loans of FASL were refinanced from the proceeds of a term loan entered into between Spansion Japan, which owns the assets of FASL, and a Japanese financial institution. Under the agreement, the amounts borrowed bear an interest rate of TIBOR plus a spread that is determined by Fujitsu’s current debt rating and Spansion Japan’s non-consolidated net asset value as of the last day of its fiscal year. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal installments ending in June 2007. As a result of Spansion’s IPO, the amount outstanding under this loan facility is no longer consolidated on our consolidated balance sheet. 47 Table of Contents Fujitsu has guaranteed 100 percent of the amounts outstanding under this facility. We agreed to reimburse Fujitsu 60 percent of any amount paid by Fujitsu under its guarantee of this loan. As of December 25, 2005, $72 million was outstanding under this term loan agreement. Spansion Japan’s assets are pledged as security for its borrowings under this agreement. Spansion Capital Lease Guarantee We guaranteed certain capital leases entered into by Spansion and its subsidiaries totaling $35 million as of December 25, 2005. The amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by Spansion over the lease terms. Spansion Operating Lease Guarantees We guaranteed certain operating leases entered into by Spansion and its subsidiaries totaling $7 million as of December 25, 2005. The amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by Spansion over the lease terms. No liability has been recognized for these guarantees related to Spansion under the provisions of FIN 45 because we concluded the fair value of the guarantees is not significant after considering various factors including the recent IPO of Spansion, its credit rating, the ability of Spansion to make the payments on these obligations and the short maturity of the indebtedness. Other Financial Matters Termination of Revolving Credit Facility. On December 23, 2005, we terminated the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of July 7, 2003 among us, AMD International Sales & Services Ltd., Bank of America, N.A., as agent and the other lenders party thereto and repaid all of our existing obligations in full. Because no amounts were drawn under this credit facility at the time of our termination, the amount we paid to the lenders, which consisted of outstanding fees and expenses, was not material. As part of the termination, the lenders terminated and released all security interests and liens held by them as security for our obligations. Secondary Equity Offering. On January 27, 2006, we closed the offering of 14,096,000 shares of our common stock. The net proceeds to us from this equity offering, after deducting underwriting commissions and discounts, but prior to deducting offering expenses, were approximately $495 million. We will use approximately $226 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the redemption of 35 percent of the aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012. We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the possible repayment of indebtedness. Depending on our cash position, we may from time to time elect to retire certain of our outstanding debt through open market or privately negotiated transactions or by tender offer or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Spansion Agency Agreement. We have entered into an agency agreement with Spansion pursuant to which we have agreed to continue to ship products to and invoice Spansion’s customers in our name on behalf of Spansion until Spansion has the capability to do so on its own. Prior to shipping the product to Spansion’s customers, we purchase the applicable product from Spansion and pay Spansion the same amount that we invoice Spansion’s customers. In performing these services, we act as Spansion’s agent for the sale of Spansion’s Flash memory products, and we do not receive a commission or fees for these services. Under the agreement, Spansion assumes full responsibility for its products and these transactions, including establishing the pricing and determining product specifications. Spansion also assumes credit and inventory risk related to these product sales. 48 Table of Contents In accordance with EITF Issue No. 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent,” we record sales of Spansion’s Flash memory products and the related cost of sales on a net basis on our consolidated statements of operations. As a result, the net impact to our net sales and cost of sales is zero. With respect to our consolidated balance sheet, sales to Spansion’s customers are included in our “Accounts Receivable” line item whereas the payables to Spansion that relate to the products we purchased from Spansion are reflected in our “Accounts Payable to Spansion” line item. These amounts are recorded separately on the balance sheet because there is no legal right of offset in accordance with FIN 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.” AMD/Spansion Service Agreements. We are party to various service agreements with Spansion. Under our IT Services Agreement and General Services Agreement, we provide, among other things, information technology, facilities, logistics, legal, tax, finance, human resources, and environmental health and safety services to Spansion. For services rendered, we are paid fees in an amount equal to cost plus five percent except for services procured by us from third parties, which are provided to Spansion at cost. Unless otherwise earlier terminated, each of these service agreements expires on June 30, 2007, but each of us may extend the term by mutual agreement. Spansion has the ability to terminate individual services under the general services agreements at any time and for any reason upon at least six months’ advance notice. With respect to the IT service agreements and general service agreements, if we failed to comply with applicable service levels for a particular service and have not rectified such performance failure, Spansion may terminate such service after 60 days have elapsed since Spansion first notified us of the failure to perform the service. Moreover, Spansion may terminate an entire IT service agreement or general services agreement if we breach our material obligations under the respective agreement and do not cure the default within 90 days after receipt of a notice of default from Spansion. Similarly, we can terminate the respective agreement for Spansion’s failure to make payments when due if Spansion fails to cure such default within 90 days after receipt of notice of default. Outlook We are focused on increasing sales and growing market share in a profitable manner. However we are in an extremely competitive business. Microprocessor products compete on performance, quality, reliability, cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, marketing and distribution capability, brand recognition and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. We expect sales during the first quarter of 2006 to be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter of 2005. Also, during the first quarter of 2006, we expect operating expenses, which include research and development expenses and marketing, sales and administrative expenses, to increase by approximately 6 percent from comparable operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2005, which excludes those operating expenses related to the Memory Products segment. In 2006, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.4 billion and depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $825 million. We expect our tax rate to be between 10 percent to 15 percent. In addition, in 2006 Spansion’s results of operations will continue to impact our results of operations. These results will be reflected in the “Equity in Income (Loss) of Unconsolidated Investee” line item on our statement of operations and for 2006 will be based on our ownership of Spansion, which was 37.9 percent as of December 25, 2005. 49 Table of Contents Supplementary Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Disclosures Section I. Stock-Based Incentive Program Description Our stock stock-based incentive programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, our stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan), which had previously been approved by our Board of Directors. Stock options available for grant under our equity compensation plans that were in effect before April 29, 2004, (the Prior Plans), including those that were not approved by our stockholders, were consolidated into the 2004 Plan. As of April 29, 2004, equity awards are made only from the 2004 Plan. Under our Prior Plans key employees generally were, and under the 2004 Plan key employees generally have been, granted nonqualified stock options (NSOs) to purchase our common stock. Generally, options vest and become exercisable over a four-year period from the date of grant and expire five to ten years after the date of grant. Any incentive stock options (ISOs) granted under the Prior Plans or the 2004 Plan have exercise prices of not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Exercise prices of NSOs ranged from $0.01 to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. We plan to grant employees primarily restricted stock units under the 2004 Plan in 2006. Under the 2004 Plan, we can also grant up to a total of 9 million shares where the exercise price is less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. These types of grants can consist of the following awards: Restricted Stock. Restricted stock can be granted to any employee or consultant. Restricted stock that vests based on continued service does not fully vest for three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock that vests based on performance does not vest for at least one year from the date of grant. Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units are awards that obligate us to issue a specific number of shares of our common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. Restricted stock units based on continued service may not fully vest for three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units that are performance based may not vest for at least one year from the date of grant. Discount Stock Options. Discount stock options may be subject to the same requirements and conditions as are applicable to regular NSOs described above except that the fixed exercise price may be granted at up to 85 percent of fair market value on the date of grant, if the discount is in lieu of a portion of salary or cash bonus. Options cannot be exercised until they become vested. Options expire not later than 10 years after the date of grant. On April 27, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all stock options outstanding under the 2004 Plan and our prior equity compensation plans that had exercise prices per share higher than the closing price of our stock on April 27, 2005, which was $14.51. Options to purchase approximately 12 million shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately. Options held by non-employee directors were not included in the vesting acceleration. The primary purpose for accelerating the vesting was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2006 and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of operations, rather than as a footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial statements. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. On December 15, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all outstanding AMD stock options and restricted stock units held by Spansion employees that would otherwise have vested from December 16, 2005 to 50 Table of Contents December 31, 2006. In connection with the modification of the terms of these options to accelerate their vesting, $1.2 million was recorded as non-cash compensation expense on a pro forma basis in accordance with SFAS 123, and this amount was included in the pro forma stock compensation expense for the year ended December 25, 2005. The primary purpose for accelerating the vesting of these awards was to minimize future compensation expense that we and Spansion would otherwise have been required to recognize in Spansion’s and our respective statements of operations with respect to these awards. If we had not accelerated the vesting of these awards, they would have been subject to variable accounting in accordance with the guidance provided in EITF Issue 96-18 and 00-12. This accounting treatment would have applied because following Spansion’s IPO, we no longer consolidate Spansion’s results of operations in our financial statements. Accordingly, Spansion employees are no longer considered our employees. Under variable fair value accounting, we would have been required to re-measure the fair value of unvested stock-based awards of our common stock held by Spansion employees after Spansion’s IPO at the end of each accounting period until such awards were fully vested. In connection with the acceleration of the vesting of these awards, we recorded a compensation charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 of $1.5 million. In addition to the acceleration of vesting of certain stock awards as indicated above, there are approximately 684,000 unvested AMD stock options and restricted stock units that are still held by Spansion employees which are currently subject to variable accounting. In accordance with EITF 00-12, the resulting compensation charge will be recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in the same caption as the equity in income ( loss) of unconsolidated investee. Section II.

(3) The “listed officers” are those executive officers listed in the summary compensation table in our proxy statements for our annual meeting of stockholders held in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued a revision to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R eliminates our ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and generally requires a public entity to reflect on its income statement, instead of pro forma disclosures in its financial footnotes, the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The grant-date fair value will be estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those equity instruments. Among other things, SFAS 123R also requires entities to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered and, if the terms or conditions of an equity award are modified after the grant date, to recognize incremental compensation cost for such a modification by comparing the fair value of the modified award with the fair value of the award immediately before the modification. In addition, SFAS 123R amends FASB Statement No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows,” to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. We will adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. 52 Table of Contents As of the required effective date, all public entities that used the fair-value-based method for either recognition or disclosure under the original SFAS 123 will apply this revised statement using a modified version of prospective application. Under that transition method, compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards, for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards calculated under the original SFAS 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosures. For periods before the required effective date, those entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original SFAS 123. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SEC’s interpretation of SFAS 123R and the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. We will apply the modified prospective method, which requires that compensation expense be recognized for all share-based payments granted, modified or settled after the date of adoption plus the current period expense for unvested awards issued prior to the adoption of this standard. No expense is recognized for awards vested in prior periods. Although we cannot estimate the exact amount at this time, we expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial statements and will depend on the levels of share-based payments granted in the future. Due to the acceleration of options during 2005, the compensation expense previously reported in pro forma disclosures is not expected to be representative of future expected compensation expense. In addition, beginning in 2006, AMD will change its method of valuation for share-based awards granted from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was previously used for our pro forma information required under SFAS 123, to a lattice-binominal option-pricing model. In 2006, we also expect to issue fewer stock options than have been issued in the past, and plan to grant employees primarily restricted stock units. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (SFAS 154), which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements—An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28.” SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt SFAS 154 in the first quarter of 2006 and do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” (SFAS 151). This statement clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. In addition, the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this statement became effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted this statement at the beginning of 2006. Because we are already in compliance with SFAS 151, the adoption of this statement will not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 53 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in desktop and mobile PCs for many years. Intel is also a dominant competitor in the server category of the microprocessor market. Intel’s significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s: • business practices, including pricing and allocation strategies and actions, such as aggressive pricing for microprocessors to increase market share; • product mix and introduction schedules; • product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; • exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; • control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers; and • marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. For example, Intel exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intel’s competitors. Intel also dominates the PC system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a PC system. As a result, PC OEMs are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 65-nanometer process technology whereas we expect to make our first production shipments of products manufactured on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology in the first quarter of 2006. We expect to begin commercial shipments of microprocessors manufactured using 65-nanometer technology by the end of 2006. To the extent Intel manufactures its microprocessor products on larger wafers and smaller process technologies earlier than we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products, which may result in market share gains for Intel. Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We must achieve further market acceptance of our 64-bit technology, AMD64, or we will be materially adversely affected. Our AMD Opteron processors are critical to our strategy of increasing market share in the server category of the microprocessor market. Similarly, our AMD Turion 64 processors are critical to our strategy of increasing 54 Table of Contents market share in the mobile category of the microprocessor market, and particularly the “thin and light” category. Accordingly, we are making substantial investments in our roadmaps and our platforms for our processors for mobile and server computers. Increasing market acceptance of these processors, our AMD Athlon 64 processors for desktops and the AMD64 technology on which they are based is subject to risks and uncertainties including: • the continued support of operating system and application program providers for our 64-bit instruction set, including timely development of 64-bit software applications and applications that can take advantage of the functionality of dual-core processors; • our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner on advanced process technologies, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; and • the availability, performance and feature set of motherboards, memory and chipsets designed for these processors, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by our customers. If we are unable to achieve further market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, we would be materially adversely affected. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading-edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive. For example, we have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we have agreed to work together to develop new process technologies through December 31, 2011. However, capital purchases by IBM necessary for the continued development of process development projects past December 31, 2008 are conditioned upon the approval by IBM’s board of directors. If such approval is not received by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. We anticipate that under this agreement, from December 25, 2005 through December 25, 2011, we would pay fees to IBM of between $502 million and $562 million in connection with joint development projects. In addition, from the beginning of 2002 through December 25, 2005, we paid $339 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities. If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume certain research and development activities internally or find an alternate partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which would materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors at Fab 36 using advanced process technologies. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected, and may in the future materially adversely affect, our business. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous 55 Table of Contents new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. Our historical financial results have also been subject to substantial fluctuations. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. We incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to: • the cyclical nature of supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; • a decline in demand for end-user products that incorporate our semiconductors; • excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including our customers; • excess production capacity; and • substantial declines in average selling prices. For example, in 2001 and 2002 we implemented restructuring plans due to weak customer demand associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry. If the semiconductor industry were to experience a downturn in the future, we would be materially adversely affected. The demand for our products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold. A market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop PCs, and servers. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Depending on the growth rate of computers sold, sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease. If demand for computers is below our expectations, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from Intel Corporation, such as Dell, Inc., could further materially adversely affect us. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth global markets. In 2005, sales of our products to high-growth markets such as China, Eastern Europe and India increased compared to 2004, and these markets are an important area of future growth for us. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may not grow, and may even decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Intense competition in the microprocessor market could materially adversely affect us. Our principal competitor in the microprocessor market is Intel Corporation. Microprocessor products compete on performance, quality, reliability, cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, brand recognition and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. We may not be able to compete effectively if we fail to reduce our manufacturing costs and develop, introduce and sell on a timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products at competitive prices. We depend on third-party companies for the design and manufacture of core-logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and other components. Our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors because our patent-cross license agreement with Intel does not extend to Intel’s proprietary bus interface protocol. Accordingly, we depend on third-party companies for the design and manufacture of core-logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and other components that support our microprocessor offerings. In recent years, many of these third-party designers and manufacturers have lost 56 Table of Contents significant market share to Intel or exited the business. If we are unable to secure sufficient support for our microprocessor products from these designers and manufacturers, or if suppliers of chipsets cannot provide us with sufficient quantities of chipset products to meet our demand, our business would be materially adversely affected. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of our antitrust lawsuits against Intel, our business may be materially adversely affected. On June 27, 2005, we filed an antitrust complaint against Intel Corporation and Intel’s Japanese subsidiary, Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, which we refer to collectively as Intel, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, and the California Business and Professions Code. Our complaint alleges that Intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market by engaging in anti-competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that limit the ability and/or incentive of Intel’s customers in dealing with AMD. Also, on June 30, 2005, our subsidiary in Japan, AMD Japan K.K., filed an action in Japan against Intel K.K. in the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District Court for damages arising from violations of Japan’s Antimonopoly Act. If our antitrust lawsuits against Intel are ultimately unsuccessful, our business, including our ability to increase market share in the microprocessor market, could be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. Collectively, our top five OEM and distributor Computation Products customers accounted for a significant percentage of our total net sales in 2005. If one of these customers decided to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers were materially to reduce its operations or its demand for our products, we would be materially adversely affected. If we fail to keep pace with new product designs and improvements or if we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted, customers may not buy our products and we may be adversely affected. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop and qualify new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. If we are delayed in developing or qualifying new products or technologies, such as high performance, low-power processors, we could be materially adversely affected. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. A substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of net sales for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, demand in the retail sector of the PC market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control. Manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may have a material adverse affect on us. There may be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could have a material adverse effect on us. 57 Table of Contents In November 2004, we entered into sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing whereby Chartered agreed to become an additional manufacturer of our AMD64-based microprocessors. We expect that Chartered will begin production in 2006. The ability of Chartered to begin production on a timely basis depends on several factors beyond our control, including Chartered’s ability to implement our technology at their facilities on a timely basis. In addition, the additional capacity gained through the use of 300-millimeter wafers at Fab 36 plays a fundamental role in our growth plans for the next several years. We plan to add production output at Fab 36 on a year-to-year basis. If we are not able to achieve our production plans at Fab 36 on a timely basis, we may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products. If we cannot obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements, we could be materially adversely affected. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. We purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because the equipment that we purchase is complex, it is difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. Certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we are largely dependent on one supplier for our 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. Although we are in the process of qualifying alternate sources, we do not believe that they currently have sufficient capacity to meet our requirements for SOI wafers. We are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials, we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on us. Industry overcapacity could cause us to under-utilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on us. Semiconductor companies with their own manufacturing facilities and specialist semiconductor foundries, which are subcontractors that manufacture semiconductors designed by others, have added significant capacity in recent years and we expect them to continue to do so. In the past, capacity additions sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry. Fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market, which may in the future put pressure on our average selling prices and materially adversely affect us. It is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the markets we serve, making it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity. If our target markets do not grow as we anticipate, we may under-utilize our manufacturing facilities, which may result in write-downs or write-offs of inventories and losses on products whose demand is lower than we anticipate. In addition, during periods of industry overcapacity, customers do not generally order products as far in advance of the scheduled shipment date as they do during periods when our industry is operating closer to capacity, which can exacerbate the difficulty in forecasting capacity requirements. Many of our costs are fixed. Accordingly, during periods in which we under-utilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand 58 Table of Contents for certain of our products, our costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period. When this occurs, our operating results are materially adversely affected. We are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by facilitizing Fab 36, transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies and larger wafers and making significant capital investments in our existing manufacturing facilities. If the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations, we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities. This has in the past had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on us. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing our products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. We continually modify manufacturing processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs. We may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, delays in the development of new process technologies, changes in our process technologies, upgrades or expansion of existing facilities, or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process. Improving our manufacturing efficiency in future periods is dependent on our ability to: • develop advanced product and process technologies; • successfully transition to advanced process technologies; • ramp product and process technology improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across our facilities; and • achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing wafer output and yields, which may decrease as we implement more advanced technologies. For example, we plan to begin 65-nanometer production by the end of 2006. Our goal is to be substantially converted to 65-nanometer in Fab 36 by mid-2007. During periods when we are implementing new process technologies, manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do. Our results of operations would also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products, our ability to sell our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our microprocessors. If we fail to retain the support of Microsoft, our ability to market our microprocessors would be materially adversely affected. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position. Our indebtedness may: • make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; 59 Table of Contents • limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; • limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; • require us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; • limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and • increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. If we cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may be unable to make all of our planned capital expenditures or fulfill our obligations. For 2005, our capital expenditures were $1.5 billion which included Spansion’s capital expenditures through December 20, 2005. For 2006, we plan to make approximately $1.4 billion of capital expenditures. Our ability to fund capital expenditures in accordance with our business plan depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing. Moreover, under the revolving credit agreement among AMD, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 KG, we or AMD Fab 36 Holding are required to provide up to $890 million to AMD Fab 36 KG (based on an exchange rate of 0.843 euros to one U.S. dollar as of December 25, 2005). Loans provided to AMD Fab 36 KG under this revolving credit agreement are unsecured and subordinated to the rights of the consortium of banks that will also be providing financing to AMD Fab 36 KG. Our capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and market competition. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain needed debt and/or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures. If we curtail capital expenditures or abandon projects, we could be materially adversely affected. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, in the future. Subject to the restrictions in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. In particular, AMD Fab 36 KG will have the ability, subject to achieving certain milestones, to borrow up to $831 million (based on an exchange rate of 0.843 euros to one U.S. dollar as of December 25, 2005) from a consortium of banks under its Fab 36 Loan Agreements. Although the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, or our guarantees of other parties’ debts, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, 60 Table of Contents and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt due to a failure to meet drawdown conditions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing our 7.75% Notes contains various covenants that limit our ability to: • incur additional indebtedness; • Pay dividends and make other restricted payments; • make certain investments; • create or permit certain liens; • create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • use the proceeds from sales of assets; • enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In addition, the Fab 36 Loan Agreements contain restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on the ability of AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts. Our ability to satisfy these covenants, financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the applicable agreement. Moreover, our agreements contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness that results in acceleration of the maturity date or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes accelerates the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and/or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us. We receive capital investment grants and allowances from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 36. We have also received capital investment grants and allowances as well as interest 61 Table of Contents subsidies from these governmental entities for Fab 30. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we may be materially adversely affected. If our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. If one or more of our products were found to be defective after the product had been shipped to customers in volume, the cost of product replacements or product returns would be substantial, and our reputation with our customers would be damaged. In addition, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to fix defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect us. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including physical distribution of our products, and co-source some information technology services. We rely on a third-party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we rely on a third party in India to provide certain information technology services to us, including helpdesk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access. Our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations, the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for our facilities could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we decided to outsource or co-source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and to create a more variable cost structure. However, if the costs related to administration, communication and coordination of these third-party providers are greater than we expect, then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings. 62 Table of Contents Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days or more prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which are difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory. Because market conditions are uncertain, these and other factors could materially adversely affect us. Our reliance on third-party distributors subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors’ products. Our third party distributors have been a significant factor in our ability to increase sales of our products in certain high growth international markets. Accordingly, we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors’ products over our products, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book or that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re-sold by the distributors. However, in the event of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer to our distributors would materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. All of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in Germany. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia and Singapore. We also depend on foreign foundry suppliers for the production of certain of our embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and we depend on an international joint venture for the manufacture of optical photomasks for use in manufacturing our microprocessors. In addition, we have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets. Our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated net sales was 79 percent in 2005 and China was one of our largest and fastest growing markets. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: • expropriation; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; • changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; 63 Table of Contents • difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; • difficulties in achieving headcount reductions; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates; • restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; • changes in freight and interest rates; • disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and • loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs. Any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health or safety concerns, natural disasters or general economic factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could have a material adverse effect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. For example, China’s economy has been growing at a fast pace over the past several years, and the Chinese government introduced various measures to slow down the pace of economic growth. A decline in economic conditions in China could lead to declining worldwide economic conditions. If economic conditions decline, whether in China or worldwide, we could be materially adversely affected. The occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the Middle East have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect demand for our products. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations, directly or indirectly, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales, and our supply chain. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. As a result of our foreign operations, we have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro. For example, some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our euro-denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 64 Table of Contents Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted products, which adversely affects demand for our products. In addition, our inability to control gray marketing activities could result in customer satisfaction issues, because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel, there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products represented as new. Our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. Foreign laws may provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, we would be materially adversely affected. We are party to intellectual property litigation and may become a party to other intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we have been notified, or third parties may bring actions against us, based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot obtain a license, these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages (potentially including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products, would have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. 65 Table of Contents We are subject to a variety of environmental laws that could result in liabilities. Our operations and properties are subject to various U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Our management systems are designed to maintain compliance. However, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at or under our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union has enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affects semiconductor packaging. Other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Future litigation proceedings may materially adversely affect us. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages. In addition, future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Our assembly and test facilities are located in China, Malaysia and Singapore. In the event of a major earthquake, or other natural or manmade disaster, we could experience loss of life of our employees, destruction of facilities or business interruptions, any of which could materially adversely affect us. 66 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Ownership of Spansion Inc. Common Stock Spansion’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours through December 20, 2005, but as a result of its initial public offering, we currently report our interest in Spansion using the equity method of accounting. We currently own 48,529,403 shares, or approximately 37.9 percent, of Spansion’s outstanding common stock. As a result, our 37.9 percent share of Spansion’s net income (loss) will impact our net income (loss). The following risks and uncertainties that Spansion faces could affect Spansion’s financial position or results of operations and correspondingly our financial position and results of operations. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that Spansion faces. Spansion also faces many of the risks and uncertainties that we face as described above in this “Risk Factors” section, as well as those set forth in Spansion’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended, and other SEC filings, to which we refer you. The demand for Spansion’s products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold. A market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on Spansion’s results of operations. Spansion is dependent to a large degree upon demand for mobile telephones, consumer electronics such as set top boxes and DVD players, automotive electronics, industrial electronics such as networking equipment, and PC peripheral equipment such as printers. Sales of Spansion products also depend on OEMs including increasing amounts of NOR Flash memory content in their products. In 2004 and 2005, demand from the wireless category of the Flash memory market drove a majority of Spansion’s sales. If demand for these products, or NOR Flash memory content in these products, is below Spansion’s expectations, or if the functionality of successive generations of these products does not require increasing NOR Flash memory density, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Spansion has lost, and will continue to lose, rights to key intellectual property arrangements once it is no longer a beneficiary of our patent cross-license agreements and other licenses, which creates a greatly increased risk of patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against Spansion. As a majority owned subsidiary, Spansion had been the beneficiary of our intellectual property arrangements with third parties, including patent cross-license agreements with other major semiconductor companies such as Intel, Motorola and IBM, and licenses from third parties for technology incorporated in Spansion’s products and software used to operate its business. Following Spansion’s initial public offering, it was no longer a beneficiary under a number of those agreements. As a result, it lost rights to use important intellectual property that it was previously licensed to use and may therefore be subject to claims that it is infringing intellectual property rights of third parties through the manufacture and sale of its products and the operation of its business. Therefore, absent negotiating its own license agreements with third parties who own such intellectual property, Spansion will be vulnerable to claims by such parties that its products or operations infringe such parties’ patents or other intellectual property rights. In addition, third parties may have refrained from asserting intellectual property infringement claims against Spansion because it had been a majority owned subsidiary of ours. In addition, we believe that Spansion will lose additional rights under our patent cross-license agreements and other licenses once we no longer hold a majority of Spansion’s shares entitled to vote for the election of Spansion’s directors, assuming we are still party to such agreements and licenses at such time. The parties to these agreements and licenses, and other third parties with whom we had no prior intellectual property arrangement, may file lawsuits against Spansion seeking damages (potentially including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of Spansion’s products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of Spansion’s business as presently conducted. Such litigation could be extremely expensive. The award of material damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction, would have a material adverse effect on Spansion. A lack of market acceptance of MirrorBit technology could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Market acceptance of products based on Spansion’s MirrorBit technology is a critical factor impacting Spansion’s ability to increase revenues and market share as well as to enter new markets. MirrorBit technology is 67 Table of Contents a memory cell architecture that enables Flash memory products to store two bits of data in a single memory cell thereby doubling the density or storage capacity of each memory cell. If adoption of Spansion’s MirrorBit technology occurs at a slower rate than Spansion anticipates, Spansion’s ability to compete will be reduced, and Spansion would be materially adversely affected. If Spansion does not achieve market acceptance of products incorporating this technology, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Spansion Flash memory products are based on NOR architecture, and a significant market shift to NAND architecture could materially adversely affect Spansion. Flash memory products are generally based either on NOR architecture or NAND architecture. To date, Spansion’s Flash memory products have been based on NOR architecture, which are typically produced at a higher cost-per-bit than NAND-based products. Spansion does not currently manufacture products based on NAND architecture. From 2003 through 2005, industry sales of NAND-based products grew at higher rates than sales of NOR-based products, resulting in NAND vendors in aggregate gaining a greater share of the overall Flash memory market and NOR vendors in aggregate losing overall market share. In fact, in 2005, sales of NAND-based Flash memory products represented a majority of the Flash memory products sold in the overall Flash memory market. Moreover, the removable storage category of the Flash memory market, which is currently the second largest category after wireless, and is predominantly served by NAND vendors, is expected to be the fastest growing portion of the Flash memory market for the foreseeable future. As mobile phones and other consumer electronics become more advanced, they will require higher density Flash memory to meet the increased data storage requirements associated with music downloads, photos and videos. Because storage requirements will increase to accommodate data-intensive applications, OEMs may increasingly choose NAND-based products over NOR-based products for their applications. Moreover, some NAND vendors are manufacturing on 300-millimeter wafers or are utilizing more advanced manufacturing process technologies than Spansion is today, which results in an ability to offer products with a lower cost-per bit at a given product density. If NAND vendors continue to increase their share of the Flash memory market, Spansion’s market share may decrease, which would materially adversely affect Spansion. If Spansion fails to successfully develop products based on its new ORNAND architecture, or if there is a lack of market acceptance of products based on its ORNAND architecture, Spansion’s future operating results would be materially adversely affected. As mobile phones become more advanced, they will require higher density Flash memory to meet increased data storage requirements. Spansion has stated its intention to position itself to address the increasing demand for higher density Flash memory within the wireless category of the Flash memory market by offering products based on its ORNAND architecture, which Spansion has recently introduced. The success of its ORNAND architecture requires that Spansion timely and cost effectively develop, manufacture and market ORNAND-based products that are competitive with NAND-based Flash memory products in the wireless category of the Flash memory market. If Spansion fails to develop and commercialize its ORNAND architecture on a timely basis or if Spansion’s ORNAND-based products fail to achieve acceptance in the wireless market, Spansion’s operating results would be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant mobile phone customer may have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Sales of Spansion products are dependent to a large extent on demand for mobile phones. Historically, a small number of customers in the wireless category have driven a substantial portion of net sales. If one of these customers decided to stop buying Spansion’s products, or if one of these customers were materially to reduce its operations or its demand for Spansion’s products, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. 68 Table of Contents Spansion has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect its financial condition. Spansion has a substantial amount of indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness may: • require Spansion to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; • make it difficult for Spansion to satisfy its financial obligations; • limit Spansion’s ability to use its cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; • limit Spansion’s flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business and industry; • place Spansion at a competitive disadvantage compared to its less leveraged competitors; and • increase Spansion’s vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. If Spansion cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow and obtain external financing, it may be unable to make all of its planned capital expenditures. Spansion’s ability to fund anticipated capital expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Spansion’s capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on Spansion’s cash flow and may decrease its cash balances. Spansion’s inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require it to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures. However, if it cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing, Spansion may be delayed in achieving such capacity, and Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Spansion’s business has been characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods, which can negatively affect Spansion’s results of operations unless it is able to reduce its costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices. Average selling prices for Spansion’s products historically have declined over relatively short time periods. Spansion is unable to predict pricing conditions for future periods. Even in the absence of downturns or oversupply in the industry, average selling prices of Spansion’s products have decreased during the products’ lives. When Spansion’s average selling prices decline, its net sales and net income decline unless it is able to compensate by selling more units, reducing its manufacturing costs or introducing new, higher margin products that have higher densities and/or incorporate advanced features. If Spansion’s average selling prices continue to decline, its operating results could be materially adversely affected. If Spansion’s cost reduction efforts are not effective, Spansion could be materially adversely affected. Spansion is undertaking a number of actions in an effort to significantly reduce its expenses. These actions include streamlining operations and continuing to align manufacturing utilization to the level of demand for Spansion products, controlling increasing testing costs and working with us and Fujitsu to reduce costs under services agreements. We cannot assure you that any of these actions will occur as anticipated or at all, or that Spansion will be able to achieve significant cost reductions. If Spansion’s cost reduction efforts are unsuccessful, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing capacity constraints may have a material adverse affect on Spansion. There may be situations in which Spansion’s manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of Spansion’s products. Spansion’s inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in its own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could have a material 69 Table of Contents adverse effect on Spansion. For example, in the first half of 2004, Spansion was not able to meet demand for certain of its lower density embedded Flash memory products because in 2003 it underestimated demand for these products, and was unable to install additional wafer fabrication capacity on a timely basis. Spansion has stated its belief that this adversely impacted its relationships with customers who received reduced allocations, or did not receive allocations, of its embedded products, and Spansion has stated its belief that its competitors were able to take advantage of this situation to increase their market share. More recently, in the third quarter of 2005, Spansion experienced capacity constraints for final test and assembly of certain products. While Spansion is working internally and with subcontractors to realign and increase capacity to meet anticipated demand, Spansion does not expect to be able to do so in the short term. These capacity constraints limit Spansion’s ability to respond to rapid and short-term surges in demand for its products. Spansion’s inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in its own facility or through foundry, subcontractor or similar arrangements with third parties, could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Spansion is party to intellectual property litigation and may become party to other intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause it to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit it from selling its products. Tessera, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Spansion alleging that it has infringed certain of Tessera’s patents. Tessera has sought to enjoin such alleged infringement and to recover an unspecified amount of damages. In addition, Fujitsu has informed Spansion that it has been informed by Texas Instruments that Texas Instruments believes that several of Spansion’s products infringe some of Texas Instruments’ patents. Fujitsu has also informed Spansion that it expects Spansion to defend and indemnify Fujitsu against Texas Instruments’ claims in accordance with the terms of Spansion’s distribution agreement with Fujitsu. Defending these claims and similar claims could be extremely expensive and time-consuming for Spansion, and defending these claims or others or the award of damages or an injunction could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Intense competition in the Flash memory market could materially adversely affect Spansion. Spansion’s principal competitors in the Flash memory market are Intel Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., STMicroelectronics, Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., Macronix International Co., Ltd., Toshiba Corporation, Sharp Electronics Corp. and Renesas Technology Corp. and may also include the joint venture between Intel and Micron Technology, Inc. The principal bases of competition in the Flash memory market are cost, selling price, performance, quality and customer relationships. In particular, in the past, Spansion’s competitors have aggressively priced their products in order to increase market share, which resulted in decreased average selling prices for Spansion’s products and adversely impacted Spansion’s results of operations. In addition, recent capital investments by competitors have resulted in substantial industry manufacturing capacity, which may further contribute to a competitive pricing environment. Also, Spansion and certain of its competitors have licensed Flash memory technology called NROM technology from a third party. NROM technology has similar characteristics to Spansion’s MirrorBit technology which may allow these competitors to develop new Flash memory technology that is competitive with Spansion’s MirrorBit technology. Spansion may not be able to compete effectively if it fails to reduce its manufacturing costs and develop, introduce and sell on a timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products at competitive prices. If Spansion is unable to timely and efficiently implement 300-millimeter wafer capacity for the manufacture of its Flash memory products, Spansion could be materially adversely affected. Spansion has stated its intention to develop manufacturing capacity on 300-millimeter wafers for its Flash memory products. The timing for implementing 300-millimeter capacity will depend in part on the demand for 70 Table of Contents Spansion’s Flash memory products and the ability to fund the construction of such a facility if Spansion chooses to develop capacity internally. If Spansion is delayed in having this capacity or is unable to timely and efficiently ramp production on 300-millimeter wafers, Spansion would not achieve anticipated cost savings and capacity associated with this technology, and Spansion could be materially adversely affected. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture Spansion’s products, Spansion could be materially adversely affected. Spansion’s manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to Spansion or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because the equipment that Spansion purchases is complex, it is difficult for it to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. Certain raw materials Spansion uses in manufacturing its products are available from a limited number of suppliers. For example, Spansion purchases commercial memory die, such as SRAM, pSRAM, 1pSDRAM and NAND from third-party suppliers and incorporates these die into its multi-chip package products. Spansion’s production of Flash memory products was constrained in the first half of 2004 because of difficulties in procuring adequate supply of pSRAM. Some of Spansion’s major suppliers, including Samsung, are also its competitors in the Flash memory market. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If Spansion is unable to procure certain of these materials, Spansion may have to reduce its manufacturing operations. Such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on Spansion. If the market value of our shares of Spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares for an extended period of time, then our results of operations may be adversely affected. If the market value of our shares of Spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares and the decline in the market value level is deemed “other than temporary,” then we may be required to take an impairment charge in the amount of the difference between the book value and the market value. For the quarter in which we took any such impairment charge, our results of operations could be adversely affected by the amount of such impairment charge. In addition, the carrying value of our investment in Spansion on our balance sheet would also be reduced. Therefore, sustained decreases in the market price of Spansion’s common stock could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In order to reduce this interest rate risk, we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities. As of December 25, 2005, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short-term investments and consisted primarily of bank notes, short-term corporate notes, short-term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short-term federal agency notes. The majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term. We continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate. We do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. 71 Table of Contents On December 21, 2005, Spansion LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spansion Inc., issued to us $175 million aggregate principal amount of the Spansion Senior Notes. We purchased the Spansion Senior Notes for approximately $158.9 million in cash, at 90.828 percent of face value. The Spansion Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of Spansion LLC and will rank junior to any existing and future senior debt of Spansion Inc, or Spansion LLC. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year beginning April 15, 2006 until the maturity date of April 15, 2016. Spansion LLC’s obligations under the Spansion Senior Notes are guaranteed by Spansion Inc., Spansion Technology Inc., a subsidiary of Spansion Inc., and any restricted subsidiary of Spansion that guarantees any of Spansion’s public debt in the future. Because we can sell these notes to a third party in a private transaction, and we intend to sell them in 2006, we classified these notes as short-term investments.

As of December 25, 2005, as a result of our foreign operations, we have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro. For example, some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our euro-denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our profitability and cash flows. We use foreign currency forward and option 72 Table of Contents contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 25, 2005, we had an aggregate of $566 million (notional amount) of short-term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in euro outstanding. Commencing from December 26, 2005, we changed the functional currency for our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, from the euro to the U.S. dollar. Therefore, from 2006 and for the foreseeable future, all of our subsidiaries will use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. The change in the functional currency of these subsidiaries is in accordance with SFAS 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”, (SFAS 52) and reflects the changed economic facts and circumstances pertaining to these subsidiaries. Under the requirements of SFAS 52, we assessed the various economic factors relating to AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG and concluded that due to changes in facts, circumstances, scope of operations and business practices, the U.S. dollar is now the currency of the primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate. However, locally incurred expenses of these subsidiaries will continue to be denominated in euro, and unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations would cause our euro-denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, thereby adversely affecting our profitability and cash flow. We will continue to monitor and to hedge this foreign risk exposure. In addition, as a result of the Spansion IPO, as of December 21, 2005, we no longer have any foreign exchange risk related to Japanese yen, and approximately $370 million of Spansion’s debt to third parties, which was mostly variable rate, was deconsolidated from our financial position. During the time that Spansion’s results of operations were consolidated with our results of operations, we had sales, costs, assets and liabilities that were denominated in Japanese yen. For example, sales of Spansion Flash memory products in Japan were denominated in yen and certain manufacturing costs related to Spansion Flash memory products were denominated in yen. Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 25, 2005 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. In particular, generally, we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, which are included in this Form 10-K. Introduction We are a global semiconductor company with facilities around the world. During most of 2006, within the global semiconductor industry, we offered primarily: • x86 microprocessors, for the commercial and consumer markets, which are used for control and computing tasks; and • Embedded microprocessors for commercial, commercial client and consumer markets. As a result of our acquisition of ATI in October 2006, we began to supply 3D graphics, video and multimedia products and chipsets for desktop and notebook PCs, professional workstations, and servers as well as products for consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, digital TVs and game consoles. Therefore, since the acquisition, we have actively participated in the semiconductor graphics and chipset markets as well as in the semiconductor market for consumer electronics devices. Prior to the closing of the initial public offering, or IPO, of Spansion Inc., on December 21, 2005, which is described in more detail below, we also manufactured and sold Flash memory devices through Spansion LLC, our former majority-owned subsidiary. In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2006 compared to 2005 and 2005 compared to 2004, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. Our results of operations include sales of graphics, video, multimedia and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices from the closing date of the ATI acquisition on October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006 in two new reportable segments: (i) Graphics and Chipsets and (ii) Consumer Electronics. We are not able to provide any comparative information for these two segments because prior to the ATI acquisition, we did not participate in these markets. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business;” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data;” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Overview Total net revenue in 2006 amounted to $5.6 billion, an increase of 44 percent from net revenue, excluding the Memory Products segment, of $3.9 billion in 2005. 2006 included approximately $400 million of net revenue attributable to our two new reportable segments—Graphics and Chipsets, and Consumer Electronics. Overall growth, however, was primarily driven by the performance of our Computation Products segment where net revenue of $5.1 billion increased by 35 percent compared to 2005 due to increased unit sales of our desktop, mobile and server processors. We believe that our continued strategy of developing products based on our customers’ needs combined with our open standards approach, which allows customers to choose the combination of technologies that best serve their needs, contributed to accelerating customer and end-user adoption of our products across all geographies. During 2006 we also experienced the following: increasing adoption of our products among enterprises; increasing sales of our server and mobile processor products; establishment of relationships with key OEMs such as Dell Inc., Founder Technology and Tsinghua Tongfang and strengthening relationships with existing OEM customers; and a decrease in our dependence on mature markets such as North America and Europe by focusing on high growth markets, such as China. By the end of 2006, 95 percent of the top 100—and over 65 percent 53 Table of Contents of the top 500 of the Forbes Global 2000 were using AMD64 technology, and existing customers continued to expand the number of AMD-based solutions targeting the commercial market. Also, compared to 2005, sales of our mobile and server processor products grew faster than sales of our desktop products. We believe our progress in the marketplace in 2006 will allow us to continue to develop products based on platform solutions. Platforms consist of a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a better product than if the technologies were used separately. With our acquisition of ATI in October 2006, which is described in more detail below, we intend to develop and offer integrated CPU and GPU platforms to our customers. However, we also intend to continue to develop and provide discrete microprocessor and graphics processor products and to maintain open interface and software standards in order to allow our customers to choose the combination of technologies that best serve their needs. We also continued to execute our microprocessor manufacturing plans during 2006. During the first quarter, we began commercial shipments of processors manufactured on 300-millimeter wafers at Fab 36. During June 2006, we began shipments of processors manufactured at Chartered Semiconductor, and during the fourth quarter we began commercial shipments of processors manufactured using 65-nanometer technology. We also announced developments in our future manufacturing capacity strategy. In May 2006, we announced plans to significantly expand our 300-millimeter manufacturing capacity in Dresden, Germany by converting Fab 30 from manufacturing 200-millimeter wafers to 300-millimeter wafers, expanding the capacity of Fab 36 and adding a new facility to support bump and test activities. We also announced an agreement with the New York State Urban Development Corporation d/b/a Empire State Development Corporation pursuant to which we would receive financial incentives from the State of New York to build a new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility on the Luther Forest Technology Campus in Saratoga County, New York if we decide to build the facility. We believe that our investment in expanding the manufacturing capacity of our Dresden operations and the option to build a new manufacturing facility in New York will provide us with maximum flexibility to intelligently scale production to meet market demand. We also faced challenges in 2006, particularly in the second half of the year, due to competitive market conditions. Despite a richer product mix in 2006 compared to 2005, average selling prices remained relatively flat. Higher average selling prices in the first half of 2006 were offset by lower average selling prices in the second half of 2006. Average selling prices decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2006 as compared to the third quarter of 2006 particularly for our server processor products, which had a negative impact on fourth quarter gross margin. Similarly, gross margins in 2006 decreased compared to gross margins, excluding the Memory Products segment, in 2005. Higher gross margins in the first half of 2006 were more than offset by lower gross margins in the second half of 2006 due to declining average selling prices, higher manufacturing costs and the consolidation of the operations of ATI, which historically has had lower gross margins than AMD’s business. We believe that 2007 will continue to be extremely competitive, particularly with respect to product pricing. Another challenge in the second half of 2006 related to the ability of our supply chain to keep up with the significant ramp in microprocessor units sold across a diverse set of customers and geographies and to deliver products on a timely basis. One of our key goals in 2007 is to improve the efficiency and scalability of our supply chain. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. ATI Acquisition On October 25, 2006, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of ATI, a publicly held company headquartered in Markham, Ontario, Canada for a combination of cash and our common stock. 54 Table of Contents The aggregate consideration that we paid for all outstanding ATI common shares consisted of approximately $4.3 billion of cash and 58 million shares of our common stock. In addition, we also issued options to purchase approximately 17.1 million shares of our common stock and approximately 2.2 million comparable AMD restricted stock units in exchange for outstanding ATI stock options and restricted stock units. To finance a portion of the cash consideration paid, we borrowed $2.5 billion under the October 2006 Term Loan. The total purchase price for ATI was $5.6 billion, including acquisition related costs of $25 million, and consisted of: (In millions) Acquisition of all of the outstanding shares, stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards of ATI in exchange for: Cash $ 4,263 58 million shares of AMD common stock 1,172 Fair value of vested options and restricted stock units issued 144 Acquisition related transaction costs 25 Total purchase price $ 5,604 The fair value of the common stock we issued was determined under EITF 99-12, Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination, which reflected the average of the closing prices of our common stock on the NYSE for the three trading days prior to October 25, 2006. The fair value of the options and restricted stock units we issued was determined under SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). The vested portion of these options and restricted stock units was valued at approximately $144 million. The unvested portion valued at approximately $69 million will be amortized over the future remaining vesting periods. The stock compensation expense for 2006 related to these stock options and restricted stock units was approximately $10 million. Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. We included the operations of ATI in our consolidated financial statements from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total purchase price was preliminarily allocated to ATI’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of October 24, 2006 as set forth below: (In millions) Cash and marketable securities $ 500 Accounts receivable 290 Inventories 431 Goodwill 3,217 Developed product technology 752 Game console royalty agreement 147 Customer relationships 257 Trademarks and trade names 62 Customer backlog 36 In-process research and development 416 Property, plant and equipment 143 Other assets 25 Accounts payable and other liabilities (631 ) Reserves for exit costs (8 ) Debt and capital lease obligations (31 ) Deferred revenues (2 ) Total purchase price $ 5,604 55 Table of Contents The primary areas of purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to ATI-related exit costs, certain liabilities assumed, certain legal matters discussed in “Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings” and tax related contingencies. Resolution of ATI tax-related contingencies for amounts different than amounts recorded as of the close of the acquisition will result in adjustments to goodwill. Adjustments to amounts recorded as of the close of the acquisition related to the finalization of ATI-related exit costs and resolution of certain ATI legal contingencies will result in adjustments to goodwill or will be recorded in post-acquisition operating results, depending on the nature and timing of such adjustments. Management performed an analysis to determine the fair value of each tangible and identifiable intangible asset, including the portion of the purchase price attributable to acquired in-process research and development projects. In-Process Research and Development Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. The value assigned to IPR&D was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, specifically an excess earnings approach, which estimates value based upon the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the in-process projects, net of all contributory asset returns. The approach includes consideration of the importance of each project to the overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by ATI and its competitors. The discount rates applied to individual projects were selected after consideration of the overall estimated weighted average cost of capital for ATI and the discount rates applied to the valuation of the other assets acquired. Such weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market acceptance and penetration, market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets. We acquired and intend to continue developing approximately $306 million and $325 million in-process projects in the Graphics and Chipsets segment, and the Consumer Electronics segment. These projects include development of next generation GPU, chipset, handheld and digital TV products. The estimated fair value of the projects for the Graphics and Chipsets segment was approximately $193 million and we expect to incur approximately $113 million to complete these projects over the next two years. The estimated fair value of the projects for the Consumer Electronics segment was approximately $223 million and we expect to incur approximately $102 million to complete these projects over the next two years. In developing the estimated fair values, we used discount rates ranging from 14 percent to 15 percent. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats from our competitors. Failure to develop these technologies into commercially viable products and/or failure to bring them to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results and could negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that this acquisition was completed and may result in impairment charges. The estimates used in valuing these IPR&D were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. There have not been any significant changes in the status of the efforts to complete these projects as of December 31, 2006. 56 Table of Contents Other Acquisition Related Intangible Assets Developed product technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and includes technology in ATI’s discrete GPU products, integrated chipset products, handheld products, and digital TV products divisions. We expect this intangible asset to have a useful life of five years. Game console royalty agreements represent agreements existing as of October 24, 2006 with video game console manufacturers for the payment of royalties to ATI for intellectual property design work performed and were estimated to have an average useful life of five years. Customer relationship intangibles represent ATI’s customer relationships existing as of October 24, 2006 and were estimated to have an average useful life of four years. We expect trademarks and trade names to have an average useful life of seven years. Customer backlog represents customer orders existing as of October 24, 2006 that had not been delivered and were estimated to have a useful life of 14 months. We determined the fair value of intangible assets using income approaches based on the most current financial forecast available as of October 24, 2006. The discount rates we used to discount net cash flows to their present values ranged from 12 percent to 15 percent. We determined these discount rates after consideration of our estimated weighted average cost of capital and the estimated internal rate of return specific to the acquisition. We recorded the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets as goodwill. We based estimated useful lives for the intangible assets on historical experience with technology life cycles, product roadmaps and our intended future use of the intangible assets. We are amortizing the acquisition related intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Integration Costs Concurrent with the acquisition, we implemented an integration plan, which included the termination of some ATI employees, the relocation or transfer to other sites of other ATI employees and the closure of duplicate facilities. We estimated the costs associated with employee severance and relocation to be $7 million. We estimated the costs associated with the closure of duplicate facilities to be $1 million. These costs were included as a component of net assets acquired. Additionally, the integration plan also included termination of some AMD employees, cancellation of some existing contractual obligations, and other costs to integrate the operations of the two companies. We estimated these costs to be $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and they are included in the caption, “Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges” on our consolidated statement of operations. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenues, inventories, asset impairments, goodwill, business combination, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. 57 Table of Contents We believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near-term factory production planning. Generally, inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand for the next six months are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results which also reduces the carrying basis of the related asset(s). The new carrying value of the related asset(s) is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset(s). We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. Goodwill. As a result of the ATI acquisition, we recorded approximately $3.2 billion of goodwill on our books. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we are required to review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more often if there are indicators of impairment present. We will perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each year, with the first impairment test related to ATI goodwill to be performed during the fourth quarter of 2007. The provisions of SFAS 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we will compare the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted 58 Table of Contents discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determining of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. Business Combinations. In accordance with business combination accounting, we have allocated the purchase price of ATI to tangible and acquisition related intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in-process research and development based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to acquisition related intangible assets. We will review the acquisition related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recovered. We make estimates of fair value using reasonable assumptions based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the acquisition related intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from sale of products, expected costs to develop in-process research and development projects into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the market’s awareness of the acquired company’s brand and the acquired company’s market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. Results of Operations We review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income (loss) before interest, taxes, equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. and other, and minority interest. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. Prior to December 21, 2005, we had the following three reportable segments: • the Computation Products segment, which included microprocessor products for desktop and mobile PCs, servers and workstations and AMD chipset products; • the Memory Products segment, which included Spansion Flash memory products; and • the Personal Connectivity Solutions segment, which consisted of embedded processors for global commercial and consumer markets. 59 Table of Contents On December 21, 2005, Spansion Inc., our former majority-owned subsidiary, completed its initial public offering, or IPO. Following the IPO, our ownership interest in Spansion was reduced from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent of Spansion’s outstanding common stock. In November 2006, we sold 21 million shares of Spansion’s Class A common stock in an underwritten public offering. As a result of this sale, as of December 31, 2006 we owned approximately 21 percent of Spansion’s outstanding common stock. As a result of Spansion’s IPO, our financial results of operations include Spansion’s financial results of operations as a consolidated subsidiary only through December 20, 2005. From December 21, 2005, Spansion’s operating results and financial position are not consolidated as part of our financial results. Instead, we applied the equity method of accounting to reflect our share of Spansion’s net income (loss) from December 21, 2005 through December 31, 2006. Accordingly, our operating results, including the segment operating results for the Memory Products segment, for the year ended December 25, 2005 are not fully comparable with our results for 2004 or 2006. Because we currently report our interest in Spansion’s results of operations using the equity method of accounting, our share of Spansion’s net income (loss) will impact our net income (loss). Following Spansion’s IPO, from December 21, 2005 through October 24, 2006, we had two reportable segments: the Computation Products segment and the Embedded Products segment, which prior to the first quarter of 2006, we referred to as the Personal Connectivity Solutions segment. In addition we also had an All Other category, which was not a reportable segment. This category included sales of Personal Internet Communicator (PIC) products, which the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is also our Chief Executive Officer, began to review separately starting in the third quarter of 2005, and certain operating expenses and credits that were not allocated to any of our reportable segments because the CODM did not consider these operating expenses and credits in evaluating the operating performance of our reportable segments. Effective as of the third quarter of 2006, PIC products have not been manufactured. As a result of the acquisition of ATI, effective October 25, 2006, we now have the following four reportable segments: • the Computation Products segment, which includes microprocessors, chipset products that we manufactured prior to the ATI acquisition and related revenue; • the Embedded Products segment, which includes embedded processors and related revenue; • the Graphics and Chipsets segment, which includes 3D graphics, video and multimedia products and chipsets sold by ATI prior to the acquisition for use in desktop and notebook PCs, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers, and related revenue; and • the Consumer Electronics segment, which includes products used in handheld devices, such as mobile phones and PDAs, digital televisions and other consumer electronics products as well as related revenue and revenue for royalties received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporate our products. In addition to the reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. The All Other category includes certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments because the CODM does not consider these operating expenses and credits in evaluating the operating performance of the operating segments. Also, following the acquisition of ATI, we began including employee stock-based compensation expense, profit sharing expense, and ATI acquisition-related and integration charges in the All Other category. We reclassified prior period segment information to conform to the current period’s presentation. We use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in December. The year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of 53 weeks, and the years ended December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004 each included 52 weeks. References in this report to 2006, 2005 and 2004 shall refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. Commencing in 2007, we will use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. 60 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2006, 2005 and 2004. 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Net revenue: Computation Products $ 5,104 $ 3,793 $ 2,528 Embedded Products 149 136 130 Graphics and Chipsets 278 — — Consumer Electronics 120 — — All Other (2 ) 6 — Memory Products — 1,913 2,343 Total Net Revenue $ 5,649 $ 5,848 $ 5,001 Operating income (loss): Computation Products $ 706 $ 641 $ 280 Embedded Products (18 ) (55 ) (54 ) Graphics and Chipsets (33 ) — — Consumer Electronics 20 — — All Other (722 ) (43 ) (39 ) Memory Products — (311 ) 35 Total Operating Income (Loss) $ (47 ) $ 232 $ 222 Computation Products Computation Products net revenue of $5.1 billion in 2006 increased 35 percent compared to net revenue of $3.8 billion in 2005 primarily as a result of a 35 percent increase in unit shipments. Unit shipments increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to increased demand for processors in each of the desktop, server and mobile products. However, we believe that the challenge we experienced with the ability of our supply chain to keep up with the increased demand across a diverse set of customers and geographies and to deliver products on a timely basis had an adverse impact on unit shipments. Despite a richer product mix in 2006, average selling prices remained relatively flat in 2006 as compared to 2005. Higher average selling prices in the first half of 2006 were offset by lower average selling prices in the second half of 2006 due to competitive market conditions. Specifically, in the second half of 2006 aggressive pricing by our principal competitor in an attempt to regain market share adversely impacted our average selling prices. Our competitor also launched its quad-core multi-chip module processors during the fourth quarter of 2006, and since we did not offer quad-core products during this period, we discounted the selling price of certain of our competing products which adversely impacted our average selling prices, margins and profitability. We do not anticipate shipping our first quad-core products until mid-2007. We anticipate that 2007 will continue to remain extremely competitive, particularly with respect to product pricing. Computation Products net revenue of $3.8 billion in 2005 increased 50 percent compared to net revenue of $2.5 billion for 2004 primarily due to an increase of 37 percent in unit shipments and an increase of nine percent in average selling prices. Unit shipments increased due to greater demand for our desktop, mobile and server products across all geographic regions, particularly in North America and Greater China. In addition, our introduction of AMD Turion 64 processors for notebook PCs in March 2005, AMD Opteron dual-core processors for servers and workstations in April 2005 and AMD Athlon 64 dual-core processors for desktop PCs in May 2005 helped drive increasing customer adoption of our products. The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to increased sales of our higher priced, high-performance AMD64-based processors which contributed to a richer product mix. Computation Products operating income of $706 million in 2006 increased by $65 million, or 10 percent, compared to operating income of $641 million in 2005. This increase was primarily due the 35 percent increase 61 Table of Contents in net revenue partially offset by an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses of $258 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $222 million. Computation Products operating income of $641 million in 2005 increased by $361 million, or 129 percent, compared to operating income of $280 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to a 50 percent increase in net revenue whereas cost of sales increased by only 45 percent. Partially offsetting this increase was an increase in marketing, general and administrative expense of $199 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $203 million. Embedded Products Embedded Products net revenue of $149 million in 2006 increased by $13 million, or 10 percent, compared to net revenue of $136 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to a $16 million increase in sales of AMD Geode products, offset by $4 million decrease in legacy networking products. Embedded Products net revenue of $136 million in 2005 increased by $6 million, or four percent, compared to net revenue of $130 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $13 million increase in sales of AMD Geode products and an $8 million increase in sales of other embedded processors, partially offset by a $15 million decrease in sales of legacy networking products and MIPS-architecture based products. Embedded Products operating loss of $18 million in 2006 decreased $37 million as compared to an operating loss of $55 million in 2005. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to a $20 million decrease in research and development expenses and $12 million in sales of products that we had previously written off. Embedded Products operating loss of $55 million in 2005 was flat compared to an operating loss of $54 million in 2004. The increase in net revenue of $6 million from 2004 to 2005 was offset by an increase in operating expenses of $6 million. Graphics and Chipsets Net revenue and operating loss represents the operating results of this segment for the period of October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. We are not able to provide any comparative information for this segment because prior to the ATI acquisition we did not sell comparable products. Sales of AMD chipsets are included in the Computation Products segment. Consumer Electronics The revenue and operating income represents the operating results of this segment for the period of October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. We are not able to provide any comparative information for this segment because prior to the ATI acquisition we did not sell comparable products. Memory Products As a result of Spansion’s IPO in December 2005, we stopped manufacturing and selling memory products. Therefore, we did not have a Memory Products segment in 2006. Memory Products net revenue of $1.9 billion in 2005 decreased 18 percent compared to net revenue of $2.3 billion in 2004. In 2005, we consolidated Spansion’s net revenue into our Memory Product segment only through December 20, 2005. Therefore, approximately $104 million of Spansion’s net revenue from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005 was excluded from Memory Products net revenue in 2005. In addition, Memory Products net revenue was adversely impacted due to a decrease of 28 percent in average selling prices in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by an increase of 14 percent in unit shipments in 2005 compared to 2004. Net 62 Table of Contents revenue for the Memory Products segment for 2005 is not fully comparable with net revenue for 2004 because Spansion’s net revenue was not consolidated with our net revenue from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005. We experienced an operating loss of $311 million in 2005 in the Memory Products segment compared to operating income of $35 million in 2004. The decline in operating results was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue of $430 million while the cost of sales only decreased $109 million. Net revenue decreased as a result of a decrease of 28 percent in average selling prices in 2005 compared to 2004. Net revenue for the Memory Products segment for 2005 is not fully comparable with net revenue for 2004 because Spansion’s net revenue was not consolidated with our net revenue from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005. In addition, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $16 million during the fourth quarter of 2005. Goodwill in the amount of $16 million was generated on June 30, 2003 as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC, which we accounted for as a partial step acquisition and purchase business combination. In the fourth quarter of 2005, after considering the fact that the estimated fair value of Spansion was less than our carrying net book value and after comparing the estimated fair value of Spansion’s assets (other than goodwill) to our carrying net book value for such assets, we concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill is zero. Therefore, we wrote off the entire $16 million of recorded goodwill. All Other Category All Other net revenue in 2006 decreased by $8 million from 2005, primarily because, we had minimal revenue from sales of PIC products and customers returned previously sold PIC products. Effective as of the third quarter of 2006, PIC products have not been manufactured. All Other net revenue in 2005 was $6 million because of sales of PIC products. We launched the PIC in October 2004, and we did not generate any material sales from PIC products in 2004. All Other operating loss of $722 million in 2006 increased by $679 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million in 2005. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related charges of $557 million and an increase in employee stock-based compensation expense and profit sharing expense of $104 million. The ATI acquisition-related charges include the in-process research and development write-off of $416 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $47 million, cost of fair value adjustments to acquired inventory of $62 million and a $32 million charge associated with the integration plan which included termination of some AMD employees, cancellation of some existing contractual obligations and other costs that we incurred to integrate the operations of the two companies. All Other operating loss of $43 million in 2005 increased from $39 million in 2004, primarily due a $10 million increase in employee stock-based compensation expense and profit sharing expense, partially offset by the fact that in 2004 we incurred restructuring and other special charges of $5 million, whereas there were no comparable charges in 2005. 63 Table of Contents Comparison of Gross Margin, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net, Income Taxes and Other Expenses The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2006, December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions except forpercentages) Cost of sales $ 2,856 $ 3,456 $ 3,033 Gross margin 2,793 2,392 1,968 Gross margin percentage 49 % 41 % 39 % Gross margin percentage excluding Memory Products 49 % 56 % 55 % Research and development $ 1,205 $ 1,144 $ 934 Marketing, general and administrative 1,140 1,016 812 In-process research and development 416 — — Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges 79 — — Interest income (116 ) (37 ) (18 ) Interest expense 126 105 112 Other income (expense), net (13 ) (24 ) (49 ) Equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. and other (45 ) (107 ) — Income tax provision (benefit) 23 (7 ) 6 Gross Margin Gross margin increased to 49 percent in 2006 compared to 41 percent in 2005 because we did not consolidate Spansion’s results of operations with ours in 2006. Gross margin decreased to 49 percent in 2006 compared to gross margin, excluding the Memory Products segment, of 56 percent in 2005. Higher gross margin in the first half of 2006 was more than offset by lower gross margin in the second half of 2006. The decrease in gross margin in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to increased manufacturing costs and flat average selling prices. The increase in manufacturing costs was primarily due to a shift in our product mix to higher-end microprocessor products. In addition, consolidated gross margin was adversely impacted by approximately two percent due to the consolidation of ATI’s operations into ours from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Historically, the ATI business had lower gross margins as compared to AMD. Gross margin was also adversely impacted by approximately one percent due to the costs of fair value adjustments related to the inventory we acquired through the ATI acquisition. To the extent that average selling prices decrease without a corresponding decrease in manufacturing costs, our gross margins will be adversely impacted. Gross margin increased to 41 percent in 2005 compared to 39 percent in 2004. The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of our microprocessor products, which comprised a greater percentage of total net revenue in 2005 as compared to 2004. Computation Products net revenue carried a higher gross margin than Memory Products net revenue. In addition, the improvement in gross margin was due to a 1.5 percent increase in gross margin for Computation Products. Computation Products gross margin improved as a result of a nine percent increase in average selling prices discussed above, partially offset by increased manufacturing costs caused by the shift in our product mix to higher-end microprocessor products. Gross margin also improved because we were better able to absorb our fixed manufacturing costs due in part to improving yields at Fab 30. The improvement in gross margin was partially offset by a 12 percent decrease in gross margin for Memory Products due primarily to a decrease of 28 percent in average selling prices in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by an increase of 14 percent in unit shipments in 2005 compared to 2004. We record grants and allowances that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 or Fab 36 as long-term liabilities on our consolidated financial statements. We amortize these amounts as they are earned as a reduction to operating expenses. We record the amortization of the 64 Table of Contents production related grants and allowances as a credit to cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $116 million in 2006, $72 million in 2005, and $67 million in 2004. The fluctuations in the recognition of these credits have not significantly impacted our gross margins. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased $61 million, or 5 percent, from $1,144 million in 2005 to $1,205 million in 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to: a $222 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computation Products segment primarily due to an increase in silicon design, platform and product development costs for our microprocessor products, a $90 million increase due to the consolidation of ATI’s research and development expenses from October 25, 2006, and a $39 million increase in stock-based compensation, corporate bonus and profit sharing expenses. Research and development expenses were partially offset by the absence of Spansion research and development expenses because we did not consolidate Spansion’s results of operations into ours in 2006. In 2005, research and development expenses attributable to our Memory Products segment were $290 million. Research and development expenses increased $210 million, or 22 percent, from $934 million in 2004 to $1,144 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase of $103 million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and an increase in start-up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of $96 million. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. We record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances as well as the research and development subsidies as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $27 million in 2006, $44 million in 2005, and $21 million in 2004. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $1,140 million in 2006 increased $124 million, or 12 percent, from $1,016 million in 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to a $258 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computation Products segment primarily due to: a $215 million increase in marketing, branding and cooperative advertising costs, a $36 million increase due to the consolidation of ATI’s marketing, general and administrative expenses from October 25, 2006, and a $27 million increase in stock-based compensation, corporate bonus and profit sharing expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses were partially offset by the absence of Spansion market, general and administrative expenses because we did not consolidate Spansion’s results of operations into ours in 2006. In 2005, marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Memory Products segment were $208 million. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $1,016 million in 2005 increased $204 million, or 25 percent, compared to $812 million in 2004, primarily due to an increase of $110 million in marketing and cooperative advertising costs and other expenses related to the 17 percent increase in revenue in 2005 compared to 2004. In addition, in 2005 we wrote off goodwill of $16 million, which was originally recorded in 2003 as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC. In-process research and development, and amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges In-process research and development of $416 million in 2006 relates to projects acquired in connection with the acquisition of ATI. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges in 2006 includes amortization of $47 million and integration charges of $32 million. See “Part II, Item 7, MD&A—ATI 65 Table of Contents Acquisition—In-Process Research and Development,—Other Acquisition Related Intangible Assets and—Integration Costs,” for additional information. Effects of 2002 Restructuring Plan In December 2002, we began implementing a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry-wide excess inventory. The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities that we currently occupy under long-term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs. With the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities net of estimated sublease income that are payable through 2011, we have completed the activities associated with the 2002 Restructuring Plan. The following table summarizes activities under the 2002 Restructuring Plan for the three years ended December 31, 2006 (in millions): SeveranceandEmployeeBenefits Exit andEquipmentDecommissionCosts Total Accruals at December 28, 2003 $ 7 $ 121 $ 128 Cash payments (7 ) (20 ) (27 ) Non-cash adjustments — 5 5 Accruals at December 26, 2004 — 106 106 Cash payments — (21 ) (21 ) Accruals at December 25, 2005 — 85 85 Cash payments — (18 ) (18 ) Accruals at December 31, 2006 $ — $ 67 $ 67 Interest Income Interest income of $116 million in 2006 increased from $37 million in 2005, primarily due to a combination of an increase in average cash and marketable securities during 2006 compared to 2005 and a 54 percent increase in weighted-average interest rates. Interest income of $37 million in 2005 increased from $18 million 2004, primarily due to a 135 percent increase in weighted-average interest rates and an increase in average cash and marketable securities in 2005 compared to 2004. We expect interest income will be significantly lower in 2007 due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances. Interest Expense 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Total interest charges $ 136 $ 140 $ 121 Less: interest capitalized (10 ) (35 ) (9 ) Interest expense $ 126 $ 105 $ 112 66 Table of Contents Interest expense of $126 million in 2006 increased from $105 million in 2005 primarily for the following reasons: • Interest expense incurred on the October 2006 Term Loan and the Fab 36 Term Loan was $38 and $10 million, and these loans were not outstanding in 2005; • Interest expense incurred on capital lease payments was approximately $11 million higher in 2006 due to increased assets acquired under capital leases; and • Capitalized interest expense which was primarily related to Fab 36 was $25 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005. These factors were offset by the following factors: • During 2006 we did not consolidate Spansion’s results of operations, and, therefore interest expense on Spansion’s third-party debt, which was $24 million for 2005, was not included in 2006; • Interest expense incurred on our 4.75% Debentures decreased by $21 million in 2006 compared to 2005 because holders of the 4.75% Debentures converted their debentures into shares of our common stock during the first quarter of 2006 whereas during 2005, $500 million of the aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Debentures was outstanding; and • Interest expense incurred on our 7.75% Notes decreased by $13 million because we redeemed $210 million of the aggregate principal amount outstanding during the first quarter of 2006. We expect that interest expense will be significantly higher in 2007 due to additional interest incurred pursuant to the October 2006 Term Loan and the Fab 36 Term Loan. Interest expense of $105 million in 2005 decreased $7 million compared to $112 million in 2004 primarily for the following reasons: • In 2004, interest expense included approximately $26 million of interest under the Fab 30 Term Loan. Because we prepaid this loan on November 2, 2004, we did not incur any interest in connection with this loan in 2005; • Interest expense incurred on our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 was $9 million in 2005 compared with $19 million in 2004 because the holders of an aggregate principal amount of $201.5 million of these notes converted their notes into our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2005, and we exchanged an aggregate principal amount of $200 million of these notes in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of 2004 for shares of our common stock, and • During 2005, we capitalized interest of $35 million in connection with Fab 36 construction activities in Dresden, Germany compared with $9 million in 2004. These factors were offset by the following: • During 2005 we incurred higher interest expense of $48 million in connection with our 7.75% Notes, which we sold on October 29, 2004, compared with $8 million in 2004; and • Interest expense incurred pursuant to capital leases increased by approximately $10 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net of $13 million expense in the 2006 consisted primarily of a charge of $16 million related to a redemption premium and a charge of $4 million related to unamortized issuance costs incurred in connection with our redemption of 35 percent of the principal outstanding amount, or $210 million, of our 7.75% Notes, and $12 million of finance charges related to the Fab 36 Term Loan, partially offset by a gain of $10 million associated with Spansion LLC’s repurchase of its 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 and other miscellaneous items of income, net totaling $9 million. 67 Table of Contents Other income (expense), net of $24 million expense in 2005 consisted primarily of a loss of approximately $10 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 resulting from the mark-to-market to earnings of certain foreign currency forward contracts which became ineffective in hedging against certain forecasted foreign currency transactions and approximately $14 million of commitment and guarantee fees incurred in connection with the Fab 36 Term Loan. We don’t expect these foreign currency transactions to occur in the future due to the change of functional currency for AMD Fab 36 KG from the euro to the U.S. dollar. Other income (expense), net of $49 million in 2004 was due primarily to a charge of approximately $32 million related to a series of transactions pursuant to which we exchanged $201 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 for our common stock. The charge represented the difference between the fair value of the common stock issued in the transactions and the fair value of common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of these notes. In addition, interest income and other income (expense), net, in 2004 included a charge of approximately $14 million in connection with our prepayment of the term loan agreement between our German subsidiary, AMD Saxony Limited Liability Company & Co. KG and a consortium of banks in order to finance Fab 30, and a loss of approximately $6 million during the second quarter of 2004 resulting from the mark-to-market to earnings of certain foreign currency forward contracts that we used as economic hedges of forecasted capital contributions to AMD Fab 36 KG, which did not qualify as accounting hedges. Equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. and other Prior to the Spansion IPO, we held a 60 percent controlling ownership interest in Spansion, and Spansion’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours. Consequently, Spansion’s results of operations through December 20, 2005 were included in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows in 2005. Following Spansion’s IPO, our ownership interest was diluted from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent and we no longer exercised control over Spansion. As a result, from December 21, 2005, the closing date of the IPO, through December 25, 2005 and during 2006 we used the equity method of accounting to reflect our share of Spansion’s net income (loss), and we no longer consolidated Spansion’s financial position, operating results or cash flows with ours. In connection with the reduction of our ownership interest in Spansion, we recorded a loss of $110 million in 2005 which represents the difference between Spansion’s book value per share before and after the IPO multiplied by the number of shares of Spansion’s common stock owned by us. In November 2006, we sold 21,000,000 shares of Spansion’s Class A common stock in an underwritten public offering. We received $278 million in net proceeds from the offering and realized a gain of $6 million from the sale, which was included in the caption, “Equity in net loss of Spansion, Inc. and other” in our consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the offering, as of December 31, 2006 we own a total of 27,529,403 shares or approximately 21 percent of Spansion’s outstanding common stock. During 2006, our equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. was $51 million. As of December 31, 2006, the carrying net book value of our net equity investment in Spansion, which includes our proportionate share of Spansion’s accumulated other comprehensive income, amounted to approximately $361 million. The fair value of this investment was approximately $409 million based on Spansion’s common stock closing market price on December 29, 2006, the last trading day of the fiscal year. To the extent that our ownership in Spansion decreases in the future whether it is caused by disposal of our ownership interest or by Spansion’s issuance of additional common stock, we would record either a gain or a loss on such further dilution depending on Spansion’s book value and fair value at that time, which could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which this ownership dilution occurs. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $23 million in 2006, a tax provision benefit of $7 million in 2005, and an income tax provision of $6 million in 2004. The income tax provision in 2006 primarily results from 68 Table of Contents current foreign taxes, plus deferred U.S. taxes related to indefinite-lived goodwill, and reduced by deferred foreign benefits from removing part of the valuation allowance on German net operating loss carryovers of Fab 36. The income tax benefit in 2005 primarily reflects U.S. tax benefits realized from the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits and foreign tax benefits generated by Spansion in certain foreign jurisdictions. Spansion’s IPO did not have a material impact on our tax provision. The income tax provision in 2004 primarily reflects U.S. income taxes, including taxes on the dividends repatriated from controlled foreign corporations, partially offset by foreign tax benefits because of losses in various foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2006, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $38 million and $99 million. We also had U.S. federal and state tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $310 million and $112 million. The U.S. net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards subject to expiration will expire at various dates beginning in 2007 through 2026, if not utilized. Approximately $28 million of our U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forwards are subject to annual limitations as a result of the ATI acquisition and prior purchase transactions. Less than $6 million of U.S. federal tax credit carry-forwards will expire unused by the end of 2009 should U.S. federal income tax liabilities not be large enough to utilize them in these future years. We had German federal income and state trade tax operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $469 million and $414 million. German federal income and trade tax net operating losses are not subject to expiration. However, German losses are limited to 60 percent of taxable income in any one year. We had Canadian federal and provincial tax operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $31 million. These losses expire in 2026. We also had Canadian investment tax credits of approximately $139 million. $72 million of these investment tax credits expires in 2012 and 2013 with the remainder expiring by 2026. We also had Canadian federal and provincial research and development pools of $523 million and $275 million, respectively, which are not subject to expiration. We had net operating losses of $154 million in Barbados which expire beginning in 2012 through 2015. We also had foreign loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $34 million in other countries with various expiration dates. We maintain a full valuation allowance against all our net U.S. federal, state and Canadian deferred tax assets and certain of our other foreign deferred tax assets ($1.046 billion at December 31, 2006) because of our prior history of losses. In 2006 the net valuation allowance increased by $305 million primarily to provide valuation allowance for tax assets in Canada and for losses in the U.S. as a result of our purchase accounting related to the ATI acquisition. If we in the future determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred tax assets will be realized, an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed, resulting in a benefit to our operating results or a reduction of goodwill if the valuation allowance is related to acquired deferred tax assets. Such benefits would be recorded on the income tax (benefit) provision line of our statement of operations in the quarter such determination is made. We have placed a full valuation allowance on our Canadian net deferred tax assets acquired from the acquisition of ATI. These new Canadian operations are subject to immediate taxation in the U.S. as a branch. Future profits will be taxed at U.S. corporate tax rates net of any Canadian income taxes allowable as U.S. foreign income tax credits. We have a deferred tax liability associated with a portion of the indefinite-lived goodwill resulting from the acquisition of ATI, as this portion of the purchase price is tax deductible. Because we also have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets without this item, future increases to this deferred tax liability will increase our provision for income taxes independent of the changes in deferred tax assets, liabilities, and 69 Table of Contents valuation allowance related to other temporary differences. This deferred tax liability cannot be used as a source of realization for deferred tax assets because the underlying tax deductible goodwill is indefinite lived. Once the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, is removed continued increases to this deferred tax liability may not directly increase the tax provision as this increase will be aggregated with other deferred tax changes. While the valuation allowance is present our tax expenses will not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated income. Stock-Based Compensation Expense On December 26, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, based on estimated fair values. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we recognized stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, we changed our method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense from the multiple-option (i.e. accelerated) approach to the single option (i.e. straight-line) method. Also, upon adoption of SFAS 123R, we changed the method of valuing stock option awards from the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was previously used for our pro forma information disclosures of stock-based compensation expense as required under SFAS No. 123, Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123) to a lattice-binomial option-pricing model. The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan under SFAS 123R for the year ended December 31, 2006, which we recorded in our consolidated results of operations as follows: Stock-based compensation included as a component of: Year EndedDecember 31,2006 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 8 Research and development 30 Marketing, general, and administrative 39 Total stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchases 77 Tax benefit — Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchases, net of tax $ 77 We recognized minimal stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004. In anticipation of the adoption of SFAS 123R, beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we changed the quantity and type of instrument we primarily use in stock-based payment programs for our employees by shifting from granting primarily stock options to granting primarily restricted stock units. Restricted stock units are awards that obligate us to issue a specific number of shares of our common stock if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. Restricted stock units based on continued service generally vest over three to four years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units based solely on performance conditions generally do not vest for at least one year from the date of grant. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, all employees below the level of vice president receive restricted stock units and employees at the vice president level and above receive grants of restricted stock units and stock options. As of December 31, 2006, we had $56 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over the weighted average 70 Table of Contents period of 1.05 years. Also, as of December 31, 2006, we had $110 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.64 years. For additional information on stock-based compensation expense, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. On April 27, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all stock options outstanding under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and our prior equity compensation plans that had exercise prices per share higher than the closing price of our stock on April 27, 2005, which was $14.51. Options to purchase approximately 12 million shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately. Options held by non-employee directors were not included in the vesting acceleration. The primary purpose for accelerating the vesting was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of SFAS 123R. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. On December 15, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all outstanding AMD stock options and restricted stock units held by Spansion employees that would otherwise have vested from December 16, 2005 to December 31, 2006. In connection with the modification of the terms of these options to accelerate their vesting, $1.2 million was recorded as non-cash compensation expense on a pro forma basis in accordance with SFAS 123, and this amount was included in the pro forma stock compensation expense for the year ended December 25, 2005. The primary purpose for accelerating the vesting of these awards was to minimize future compensation expense that we and Spansion would otherwise have been required to recognize in Spansion’s and our respective statements of operations with respect to these awards. If we had not accelerated the vesting of these awards, they would have been subject to variable accounting in accordance with the guidance provided in EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Service and EITF Issue No. 00-12, Accounting by an Investor for Stock-Based Compensation Granted to Employees of an Equity Method Investee. This accounting treatment would have applied because following Spansion’s IPO, we no longer consolidate Spansion’s results of operations in our financial statements. Accordingly, Spansion employees are no longer considered our employees. Under variable fair value accounting, we would have been required to re-measure the fair value of unvested stock-based awards of our common stock held by Spansion employees after Spansion’s IPO at the end of each accounting period until such awards were fully vested. In connection with the acceleration of the vesting of these awards, we recorded a compensation charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 of $1.5 million, which was based on the estimated forfeiture rate of 7.94 percent. The actual forfeitures for 2006 were not materially different from the estimate used. International Sales International sales as a percent of net revenue were 75 percent in 2006, 79 percent in 2005 and 79 percent in 2004. In 2006, all of our net revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2005 and 2004, approximately 14 and 22 percent of our net revenue was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen. However, as a result of the closing of Spansion’s IPO on December 21, 2005, we do not expect to have significant sales denominated in the Japanese yen in the future. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2006 totaled $1.5 billion and our debt and capital lease obligations totaled $3.8 billion. 71 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. Net loss of $166 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $837 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $416 million for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the ATI acquisition, stock-based compensation expense of $77 million, and $45 million related to an equity interest in the net loss of Spansion. These charges were offset by amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $151 million. The net changes in operating assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 25, 2005 included a decrease in payables to related parties of $229 million because we no longer ship products and invoice customers on behalf of Spansion. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we shipped products to and invoiced Spansion’s customers in our name on behalf of Spansion and remitted the receipts to Spansion. The increase in other assets was primarily due to purchases of new technology licenses. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $530 million was primarily related to higher purchases of raw materials, future payment of technology licenses, and marketing accruals due to increased operations in the Computation Products segment. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion in 2005. Net income of $165 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, a non-cash charge of approximately $110 million that we incurred as a result of the dilution of our ownership in Spansion from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent as a result of Spansion’s IPO, and a non-cash charge of $16 million in connection with our write-off of goodwill that was generated as of June 30, 2003 as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC, contributed to the positive cash flows from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2005 compared to 2004 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net revenue and decreased inventories due primarily to the deconsolidation of Spansion’s results of operations from ours as a result of Spansion’s IPO. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.1 billion in 2004. Net income of $91 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $32 million associated with our exchange of $201 million of our 4.50% Notes for common stock in the fourth quarter of 2004, contributed to the positive cash flows from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2004 as compared to 2003 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net revenue, and increased inventories due primarily to an increase in microprocessor inventories resulting from a higher percentage of AMD64-based processors and improved market conditions. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 billion in 2006. We used $3.9 billion, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, to acquire ATI, and $1.9 billion to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $987 million to purchase equipment for Fab 36. This was partially offset by a net cash inflow of $947 million from sales and maturities of available for sale securities, $278 million from the sale of part of our investment in Spansion, Inc., and $175 million of proceeds from Spansion LLC’s repurchase of its 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion in 2005. We used $1.5 billion to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $726 million for Fab 36, and a net cash outflow of $726 million from purchases of available-for-sale securities, including a purchase of $175 million aggregate principal amount of Spansion’s 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes for approximately $158.9 million, partially offset by $261 million in proceeds from Spansion’s repayment of amounts outstanding under promissory notes to us and $133 million cash decrease due to the deconsolidation of Spansion’s results of operations from ours. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2004. We used $1.4 billion to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $569 million to construct Fab 36, and a net cash outflow of $150 million from purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by $34 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. 72 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion in 2006, and consisted primarily of proceeds from: borrowings of $3.4 billion pursuant to the October 2006 Term Loan and the Fab 36 Term Loan; proceeds of $495 million from the sale of our common stock in an equity offering, issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of employee stock options of $231 million; and capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project of $210 million. These amounts were offset by $539 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, primarily due to our redemption of 35 percent of the aggregate principal amount outstanding (or $210 million) of our 7.75% Notes, and $284 million to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the October 2006 Term Loan. During 2006, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flow. Net cash provided by financing activities was $494 million in 2005. This amount included $186 million in proceeds from borrowings by Spansion and $60 million of silent partnership contributions from the unaffiliated partners of AMD Fab 36 KG which we classify as debt, approximately $90 million in investments from the these unaffiliated partners, $189 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options, $163 million of capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project and $129 million of proceeds from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by Spansion. These amounts were offset by $316 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $413 million in 2004. This amount included $745 million of proceeds from financing activities, including $588 million in proceeds, net of $13 million in debt issuance costs, from the issuance of our 7.75% Notes, approximately $250 million in investments from the un-affiliated partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, $60 million of proceeds from equipment sale and leaseback transactions, $30 million of capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project, $124 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options and the elimination of our $224 million compensating cash balance due to the prepayment of our Fab 30 Term Loan. These amounts were offset by $898 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, including approximately $647 million used to prepay amounts outstanding under the Fab 30 Term Loan, including accrued and unpaid interest. Liquidity We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances together with available external financing will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital investments in the short term and long term, including the estimated additional $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2007. Should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement; through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Additionally, under the terms of the October 2006 Term Loan, we must prepay the October 2006 Term Loan with: (i) 100 percent of the net cash proceeds from any debt incurred by us or a restricted subsidiary; (ii) 50 percent of net cash proceeds from the issuance of any capital stock by us (subject to specified exceptions); (iii) 100 percent of extraordinary receipts (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan) in excess of $30 million; (iv) 100 percent of net cash proceeds from asset sales outside of the ordinary course of business in excess of $30 million, subject to a reinvestment allowance; (v) commencing with the fiscal year ending December 30, 2007, 50 percent of excess cash flow; and (vi) 100 percent of net cash proceeds from sale of capital stock of Spansion Inc. Prepayment of the October 2006 Term Loan from 50 percent of “excess cash flow” as used in the preceding clause (v), is intended to reach our cash income that is not actually applied to certain limited uses that merit priority over prepayment of the amount outstanding under the October 2006 Term Loan. Excess cash flow is 73 Table of Contents defined as consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital, but subtracting actual capital expenditures and mandatory and optional repayment of any funded debt (other than revolving loans, except to the extent the revolving loan commitment is permanently reduced). See “Part II, Item 7, MD& A- October 2006 Term Loan,” below for more information regarding the terms of this loan. Despite these mandatory prepayment obligations, we believe that, in the event additional funding is required, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We have an ongoing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $300 million worth of our common stock over a period of time to be determined by management. These repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in compliance with applicable rules and regulations, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. We are not required to repurchase any particular amount of our common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we did not repurchase any of our equity securities pursuant to this Board authorized program. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2006, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 were: Contractual Obligations Payment due by period Total Fiscal2007 Fiscal2008 Fiscal2009 Fiscal2010 Fiscal2011 Fiscal 2012and beyond (In millions) October 2006 Term Loan $ 2,216 $ 18 $ 23 $ 22 $ 22 $ 22 $ 2,109 Fab 36 Term Loan 893 53 179 268 304 89 — Repurchase obligations to Fab 36 Partners(1) 126 42 42 42 — — — 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 390 — — — — — 390 Other debt 12 3 1 1 1 1 5 Other long-term liabilities 87 6 51 20 — — 10 Aggregate interest obligation(2) 1,522 299 274 247 216 195 291 Obligations under capital leases(3) 315 25 25 26 26 26 187 Operating leases 381 69 64 54 49 26 119 Unconditional purchase commitments(4) 3,035 1,240 624 364 105 102 600 Total contractual obligations $ 8,977 $ 1,755 $ 1,283 $ 1,044 $ 723 $ 461 $ 3,711 (1) Represents the amount of silent partnership contributions that our subsidiaries are required to repurchase from the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG and is exclusive of the guaranteed rate of return. See “Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements,” below. (2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our debt obligations (excluding capital lease obligations), including the guaranteed rate of return on our repurchase of the unaffiliated partners’ silent partnership contributions, based on our assumptions regarding wafer output. (3) Includes principal and interest. (4) We have unconditional purchase commitments for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase commitments in the table above. Also, purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. 74 Table of Contents October 2006 Term Loan On October 24, 2006, we entered into a credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Syndication Agent and Administrative Agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Collateral Agent, and other lenders that may become party thereto from time to time (October 2006 Term Loan), pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion to finance a portion of the acquisition of ATI and related fees and expenses. Amounts borrowed under the October 2006 Term Loan bear interest, in the case of base rate loans, at a rate equal to the “base rate,” which is the higher of (i) the prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal and (ii) 0.5 percent per annum above the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan) plus a 1.25 percent margin, or in the case of Eurodollar loans, at a rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan) plus a 2.25 percent margin. Such margins will reduce by 0.25 percent when the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the October 2006 Term Loan is less than $1.75 billion. As of October 24, 2006, the base rate was 8.25 percent, without the margin, and the Eurodollar Rate was 5.32 percent, without the margin. Pursuant to the October 2006 Term Loan, we may select an interest period of one, two, three, six, or if available to all the lenders, nine or twelve months for each loan. The rate of interest is reset at the beginning of each new interest period. The October 2006 Term Loan is repayable in quarterly installments commencing in December 2006 and terminating in December 2013. The initial twenty-five quarterly payments are in the principal amount of approximately $6 million. The final four quarterly repayments are in the principal amount of approximately $521 million. As of December 31, 2006, the interest rate, which was based on the Eurodollar Rate, was 7.62 percent. We may prepay the October 2006 Term Loan at any time without premium or penalty. In addition, we are required to prepay the October 2006 Term Loan with: (i) 100 percent of the net cash proceeds from any debt incurred by us or a restricted subsidiary; (ii) 50 percent of net cash proceeds from the issuance of any capital stock by us (subject to specified exceptions); (iii) 100 percent of extraordinary receipts (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan) in excess of $30 million; (iv) 100 percent of net cash proceeds from asset sales outside of the ordinary course of business in excess of $30 million, subject to a reinvestment allowance; (v) commencing with the fiscal year ending December 29, 2007, 50 percent of excess cash flow; and (vi) 100 percent of net cash proceeds from sale of capital stock of Spansion Inc. See “Part II, Item 7, MD&A—Liquidity,” for additional information on the definition of “excess cash flow.” The October 2006 Term Loan contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries (which at this time are all of our subsidiaries) from: • incurring additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt; • creating or permitting certain liens; • consolidating, merging or selling assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety unless specified conditions are met; • paying dividends and making other restricted payments if a default or an event of default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; • making or committing to make any capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business exceeding a specified amount; • issuing or selling any shares of capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries; • entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; • creating restrictions on the making of certain distributions by our restricted subsidiaries, such as dividends, loans or transfer of properties to us; • permitting domestic wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries to guarantee our indebtedness unless they also guarantee the October 2006 Term Loan; and • permitting our Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan) to exceed 2.25 to 1.00. 75 Table of Contents Amounts outstanding under the October 2006 Term Loan may become due and payable upon the occurrence of specified events, including, among other things: failure to pay any obligations under the October 2006 Term Loan that have become due; breach of any representation or warranty, or specific covenants; any default in making any payment of principal or interest of any debt the outstanding amount of which exceeds $50 million or any default in the observance or performance of any other obligations under such debt; any default in the related security documents executed in connection with the October 2006 Term Loan, or the security documents or any lien created by the security documents ceasing to be in full force or effect; filings or proceedings in bankruptcy; judgment or awards entered against us or any significant subsidiary involving aggregate liability of $50 million or more; or a change of control (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan). In connection with the October 2006 Term Loan we and our subsidiaries, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd., AMD (U.S.) Holdings, Inc., AMD US Finance, Inc., ATI Research Silicon Valley Inc., ATI Research, Inc., and ATI Technologies Systems Corp. (collectively referred to as the Grantors) entered into a collateral agreement in favor of Wells Fargo, as Collateral Agent. Under the Collateral Agreement, each Grantor granted Wells Fargo a security interest in, among other things, and subject to certain exceptions, now owned and hereafter acquired: (i) accounts receivable; (ii) proceeds and products from the sale of capital stock of Spansion Inc.; (iii) the Spansion Collateral Account (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan), if and when it is created; (iv) certain of the Grantors’ respective equity interests in certain affiliates; and (v) all indebtedness for borrowed money owed to any Grantor by an affiliate. In connection with the October 2006 Term Loan and the Collateral Agreement, the Grantors and Wells Fargo, as Collateral Agent, entered into a collateral trust agreement (Collateral Trust Agreement) whereby Wells Fargo holds in trust the pledged collateral under the Collateral Agreement. The Collateral Trust Agreement is the principal document by which the holders of our 7.75% Notes are secured equally and ratably with the lenders under the October 2006 Term Loan, as is required by the Indenture, dated as of October 29, 2004, between us and Wells Fargo, as trustee. In November 2006, we repaid $278 million of the October 2006 Term Loan out of the net cash proceeds from the sale of Spansion common stock. In addition, in December 2006, we repaid the first quarterly installment of $6 million. As of December 31, 2006, $2.2 billion was outstanding under this loan. Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements Our new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36, is located in Dresden, Germany adjacent to our other wafer manufacturing facility, Fab 30. Fab 36 is owned by AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG (or AMD Fab 36 KG), a German limited partnership. We control the management of AMD Fab 36 KG through a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 LLC, which is a general partner of AMD Fab 36 KG. AMD Fab 36 KG is our indirect consolidated subsidiary. To date, we have provided a significant portion of financing for the Fab 36. In addition to our financing, Leipziger Messe GmbH, a nominee of the State of Saxony, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH, an investment consortium arranged by M+W Zander Facility Engineering GmbH, the general contractor for the project, and a consortium of banks have provided financing for the project. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are limited partners in AMD Fab 36 KG. We also anticipate receiving grants and allowances from federal and state German authorities for the Fab 36 project. We expect that our capital expenditures for Fab 36 from 2007 through 2008 will be approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate. The funding to construct and facilitize Fab 36 consists of: • equity contributions from us of $772 million under the partnership agreements, revolving loans from us of up to approximately $990 million, and guarantees from us for amounts owed by AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliates to the lenders and unaffiliated partners; 76 Table of Contents • investments of approximately $422 million from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs; • loans of approximately $893 million from a consortium of banks, which was fully drawn as of December 31, 2006; • up to approximately $716 million of subsidies consisting of grants and allowances, from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony; depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG, of which $364 million of cash has been received as of December 31, 2006; and • a loan guarantee from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders referenced above after foreclosure on all other security. As of December 31, 2006, we had contributed to AMD Fab 36 KG the full amount of equity required under the partnership agreements and no loans from us were outstanding. These equity amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. On April 21, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG entered into a EUR 700 million Term Loan Facility Agreement among AMD Fab 36 KG, as borrower, and a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, as lenders, dated April 21, 2004 (Fab 36 Term Loan) and other related agreements (collectively, the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate Fab 36. The consortium of banks agreed to make available up to $893 million in loans to AMD Fab 36 KG upon its achievement of specified milestones, including attainment of “technical completion” at Fab 36, which requires certification by the banks’ technical advisor that AMD Fab 36 KG has a wafer fabrication process suitable for high-volume production of advanced microprocessors and has achieved specified levels of average wafer starts per week and average wafer yields, as well as cumulative capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion. On October 13, 2006, we executed an Amendment Agreement dated as of October 10, 2006, which amended the terms of the Fab 36 Term Loan. Under the amended and restated Fab 36 Term Loan, AMD Fab 36 KG has the option to borrow in U.S. dollars as long as our group consolidated cash (which is defined as the sum of our unsecured cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments less the aggregate amount outstanding under any revolving credit facility) is at least $500 million. Moreover, to protect the lenders from currency risks, if our consolidated cash is below $1 billion or our credit rating drops below B3 by Moody’s and B- by Standard & Poor’s, AMD Fab 36 KG will be required to maintain a cash reserve account with deposits equal to 5 percent of the amount of U.S. dollar loans outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan and to make balancing payments into this account equal to the difference between (x) the total amount of U.S. dollar loans outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan and (y) the U.S dollar equivalent of 700 million euros (as reduced by repayments, prepayments, cancellations, and any outstanding loans denominated in euros. In October 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG borrowed $645 million in U.S. dollars under the Fab 36 Term Loan (the First Installment). In December 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG borrowed $248 million in U.S. dollars under the Fab 36 Term Loan (the Second Installment). As of December 31, 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG had borrowed the full amount available under the Fab 36 Term Loan and the total amount outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan was $893 million. AMD Fab 36 KG may select an interest period of one, two, or three months or any other period agreed between AMD Fab 36 KG and the lenders. The rate of interest on each installment for the interest period selected is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin, plus LIBOR plus minimum reserve cost if any. As of December 31, 2006, the rate of interest for the initial interest period was 7.1259 percent for the First Installment and 7.11563 percent for the Second Installment. This loan is repayable in quarterly installments commencing in September 2007 and terminating in March 2011. The amended and restated Fab 36 Term Loan also amends certain covenants applicable to AMD Fab 36 KG. For example, for as long as group consolidated cash is at least $1 billion, our credit rating is at least B3 by Moody’s and B- by Standard & Poor’s, and no event of default has occurred, the only financial covenant that AMD Fab 36 KG is required to comply with is a loan to fixed asset value covenant. Specifically, the loan to fixed 77 Table of Contents asset value (as defined in the agreement) as at the end of any relevant period specified in Column A below cannot exceed the percentage set out opposite such relevant period in Column B below: Column A Column B (Relevant Period) (Maximum Percentage of Loanto Fixed Asset Value) up to and including 31 December 2008 50 percent up to and including 31 December 2009 45 percent thereafter 40 percent As of December 31, 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG was in compliance with this covenant. If group consolidated cash is less than $1 billion or our credit rating is below B3 by Moody’s and B- by Standard & Poor’s, AMD Fab 36 KG will also be required to maintain minimum cash balances equal to the lesser of 100 million euros and 50 percent of the total outstanding amount under the Fab 36 Term Loan. AMD Fab 36 KG may elect to maintain the minimum cash balances in an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars if group consolidated cash is at least $500 million. If on any scheduled repayment date, our credit rating is Caa2 or lower by Moody’s or CCC or lower by Standard & Poor’s, AMD Fab 36 must increase the minimum cash balances by five percent of the total outstanding amount, and at each subsequent request of Dresdner Bank, by a further five percent of the total outstanding amount until such time as either the credit rating increases to at least Ba3 by Moody’s and BB- by Standard & Poor’s or the minimum cash balances are equal to the total outstanding amounts. AMD Fab 36 KG pledged substantially all of its current and future assets as security under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, we pledged our equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding pledged its equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Admin and its partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG and AMD Fab 36 Admin and AMD Fab 36 LLC pledged all of their partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG. We guaranteed the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. We also guaranteed repayment of grants and allowances by AMD Fab 36 KG, should such repayment be required pursuant to the terms of the subsidies provided by the federal and state German authorities. Pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee Agreement among us, as guarantor, AMD Fab 36 KG, Dresdner Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG, Niederlassung Luxemburg, we have to comply with specified adjusted tangible net worth and EBITDA financial covenants if the sum of our group consolidated cash declines below the following amounts: Amount (in millions) if Moody’s Rating is at least if Standard & Poor’s Rating is at least $500 B1 or lower and B+ or lower 425 Ba3 and BB- 400 Ba2 and BB 350 Ba1 and BB+ 300 Baa3 or better and BBB-or better As of December 31, 2006, group consolidated cash was greater than $500 million and therefore, the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. If our group consolidated cash declines below the amounts set forth above, we would be required to maintain adjusted tangible net worth, determined as of the last day of each preceding fiscal quarter, of not less than the amounts set forth below: Measurement Date on fiscal quarter ending Amount (In millions) December 2005 $ 1,500 March 2006 and on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter $ 1,750 In addition, if our group consolidated cash declines below the amounts set forth above, we would be required to maintain EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) as of the last day of each preceding fiscal period set 78 Table of Contents forth below in an amount not less than the amount set forth below opposite the date of such preceding fiscal period: Period Amount (In millions) for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending December 2005 and for the four fiscal quarters ending on each fiscal quarter thereafter $850 and $750 on an annualized basis for the two most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to December 31, 2006 Also on April 21, 2004, AMD, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD that owns substantially all of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, and AMD Fab 36 Admin GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD Fab 36 Holding that owns the remainder of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, (collectively referred to as the AMD companies) entered into a series of agreements (the partnership agreements) with the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, relating to the rights and obligations with respect to their limited partner and silent partner contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG. The partnership was established for an indefinite period of time. A partner may terminate its participation in the partnership by giving twelve months advance notice to the other partners. The termination becomes effective at the end of the year following the year during which the notice is given. However, other than for good cause, a partner’s termination will not be effective before December 31, 2015. The partnership agreements set forth each limited partner’s aggregate capital contribution to AMD Fab 36 KG and the milestones for such contributions. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, AMD, through AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, agreed to provide an aggregate of $772 million, Leipziger Messe agreed to provide an aggregate of $264 million and Fab 36 Beteiligungs agreed to provide an aggregate of $158 million. The capital contributions of Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are comprised of limited partnership contributions and silent partnership contributions. These contributions were due at various dates upon the achievement of milestones relating to the construction and operation of Fab 36. As of December 31, 2006, all capital contributions were made in full. The partnership agreements also specify that the unaffiliated limited partners will receive a guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent per annum on their total investment depending upon the monthly wafer output of Fab 36. We guaranteed these payments by AMD Fab 36 KG. In April 2005, we amended the partnership agreements in order to restructure the proportion of Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership and limited partnership contributions. Although the total aggregate amount that Leipziger Messe has agreed to provide remained unchanged, the portion of its contribution that constitutes limited partnership interests was reduced by $66 million while the portion of its contribution that constitutes silent partnership interests was increased by a corresponding amount. In this report, we refer to this additional silent partnership contribution as the New Silent Partnership Amount. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements and subject to the prior consent of the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin have a call option over the limited partnership interests held by Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, first exercisable three and one-half years after the relevant partner has completed the applicable capital contribution and every three years thereafter. Also, commencing five years after completion of the relevant partner’s capital contribution, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs each have the right to sell their limited partnership interest to third parties (other than competitors), subject to a right of first refusal held by AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, or to put their limited partnership interest to AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The put option is thereafter exercisable every three years. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs also have a put option in the event they are outvoted at AMD Fab 36 KG partners’ meetings with respect to certain specified matters such as increases in the partners’ capital contributions beyond those required by the partnership agreements, investments 79 Table of Contents significantly in excess of the business plan, or certain dispositions of the limited partnership interests of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The purchase price under the put option is the partner’s capital account balance plus accumulated or accrued profits due to such limited partner. The purchase price under the call option is the same amount, plus a premium of $4.6 million to Leipziger Messe and a premium of $2.8 million to Fab 36 Beteiligungs. The right of first refusal price is the lower of the put option price or the price offered by the third party that triggered the right. We guaranteed the payments under the put options. In addition, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are obligated to repurchase the silent partnership interest of Leipziger Messe’s and Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ contributions over time. This mandatory repurchase obligation does not apply to the New Silent Partnership Amount. Specifically, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin were required to repurchase Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership interest of $106 million in annual 25 percent installments commencing in December 2006, and Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ silent partnership interest of $79 million in annual 20 percent installments commencing in October 2005. As of December 31, 2006, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin repurchased $32 million of Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ silent partnership contributions and $26 million of Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership contribution. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we initially classified the portion of the silent partnership contribution that is mandatorily redeemable as debt on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value at the time of issuance because of the mandatory redemption features described in the preceding paragraph. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this debt towards its ultimate redemption value of the silent partnership contributions by the guaranteed annual rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We record this periodic accretion to redemption value as interest expense. The limited partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 KG received from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs and the New Silent Partnership Portion described above are not mandatorily redeemable, but rather are subject to redemption outside of the control of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. In consolidation, we initially record these contributions as minority interest, based on their fair value. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this minority interest toward its ultimate redemption value of these contributions by the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We classify this periodic accretion of redemption value as an additional minority interest allocation. No separate accounting is required for the put and call options because they are not freestanding instruments and not considered derivatives under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” As of December 31, 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG had received $185 million of silent partnership contributions and $238 million of limited partnership contributions, which includes a New Silent Partnership Amount of $66 million, from the unaffiliated partners. These contributions were recorded as debt and minority interest, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In addition to support from us and the consortium of banks referred to above, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony have agreed to support the Fab 36 project in the form of: • a loan guarantee equal to 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders after foreclosure on all other security; and • subsidies consisting of grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $716 million, depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG. In connection with the receipt of subsidies for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2007 and maintain this headcount through December 2012. We record the subsidies as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2012. Initially, we amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, we started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, starting from the first quarter of 2006, we amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably 80 Table of Contents over the life of the equipment because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments in equipment. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy grant documents could result in forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. As of December 31, 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG received cash allowances of $157 million for capital investments made in 2003 through 2005 as well as cash grants of $207 million for capital investments made in 2003 through 2006 and a prepayment for capital investments planned in 2007 and the first half of 2008. The Fab 36 Loan Agreements also require that we: • provide funding to AMD Fab 36 KG if cash shortfalls occur, including funding shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any defaults caused by AMD Fab 36 KG or its affiliates; and • guarantee 100 percent of AMD Fab 36 KG’s obligations under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements until the loans are repaid in full. Under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are generally prevented from paying dividends or making other payments to us. In addition, AMD Fab 36 KG would be in default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements if we or any of the AMD companies fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if, after the occurrence of the event, the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is adversely affected. Circumstances that could result in a default include: • our failure to provide loans to AMD Fab 36 KG as required under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • failure to pay any amount due under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements within five days of the due date; • occurrence of any event which the lenders reasonably believe has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets or condition of AMD Fab 36 KG or AMD or their ability to perform under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Fab 36 KG or any limited partner; • occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) of AMD; • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on payment of profits, dividends or other distributions except in limited circumstances and restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, disposing of assets and repaying subordinated debt; and • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain financial covenants, including loan to fixed asset value ratio and, in certain circumstances, a minimum cash covenant. In general, any default with respect to other indebtedness of AMD or AMD Fab 36 KG that is not cured, would result in a cross-default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. The occurrence of a default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan. In addition, the occurrence of a default under this agreement could result in a cross-default under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes and the October 2006 Term Loan. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 On October 29, 2004, we issued $600 million of 7.75% Notes due 2012 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On April 22, 2005, we exchanged these notes for publicly registered notes which have substantially identical terms as the old notes except that the 81 Table of Contents publicly registered notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and, therefore, do not contain legends restricting their transfer. The 7.75% Notes mature on November 1, 2012. Interest on the 7.75% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, beginning May 1, 2005. Prior to November 1, 2008, we may redeem some or all of the 7.75% Notes at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a “make-whole” premium, as defined in the agreement. Thereafter, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on November 1, 2008 through October 31, 2009 103.875 percent Beginning on November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010 101.938 percent Beginning on November 1, 2010 through October 31, 2011 100.000 percent On November 1, 2011 100.000 percent Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 7.75% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.75% Notes at a repurchase price of 101 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the 7.75% Notes contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, which include all of our subsidiaries from: • incurring additional indebtedness; • paying dividends and making other restricted payments; • making certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; • creating or permitting certain liens; • creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • using the proceeds from sales of assets; • entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidating, merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In February 2006, we redeemed 35 percent (or $210 million) of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 7.75 % Notes. The holders of the 7.75 % Notes received 107.75 percent of the principal amount of the 7.75 % Notes plus accrued interest. In connection with the redemption, we recorded an expense of approximately $16 million, which represents the 7.75 % redemption premium that we paid, and a charge of $ 4 million, which represents 35 percent of the unamortized issuance costs incurred in connection with the original issuance of the 7.75 % Notes. We included these charges in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. Issuance costs incurred in connection with this transaction in the amount of approximately $13 million will be amortized ratably over the term of the 7.75% Notes as interest expense, approximating the effective interest method. Of this amount, approximately $4 million was charged to other income (expense), net as a result of redemption described above. In October 2006, the holders of the 7.75% Notes received a security interest that is equal and ratable to that held by the lenders under the October 2006 Term Loan, See the section entitled “October 2006 Term Loan,” above for more information. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remaining principal outstanding under our 7.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 82 Table of Contents Other Long-Term Liabilities Other Long-Term Liabilities included $66 million related to certain technology licenses that will be paid through 2008. Other Long-Term Liabilities excluded amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 31, 2006, primarily consisted of $364 million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the Fab 30 and Fab 36 projects and a $18 million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our corporate marketing, general and administrative facility in Sunnyvale, California in 1998. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 31, 2006, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $160 million. Included in this amount is $141 million in obligations under certain energy supply contracts which AMD Fab 36 KG entered into with local energy suppliers to provide Fab 36 with utilities (gas, electricity, heating and cooling) to meet the energy demand for our manufacturing requirements. We accounted for certain fixed payments due under these energy supply arrangements as capital leases pursuant to EITF 01-8, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease and SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases. The capital lease obligations under the energy supply arrangements are payable in monthly installments through 2020. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2021. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Our total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 31, 2006, were $381 million, of which $67 million is accrued as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We will make these payments through 2011. Unconditional Purchase Commitments Total non-cancelable purchase commitments as of December 31, 2006, were $3.0 billion for periods through 2020. These purchase commitments include $1 billion related to contractual obligations of Fab 30 and Fab 36 to purchase silicon-on-insulator wafers and energy and gas and up to $169 million representing payments to IBM for 2007 and 2008 pursuant to our joint development agreement. As IBM’s services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, we expense the payments as incurred. In August 2005, we amended this agreement, and among other things, extended its termination date through December 2011. However, capital purchases by IBM necessary for the continued development of process development projects past December 31, 2008 are conditioned upon the approval of IBM’s board of directors. If such approval is not received by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. Accordingly, the table above only reflects our obligations through December 31, 2008. If such approval is received from IBM, the additional obligations from January 2009 through December 2011 would be between $304 million and $334 million. In addition, unconditional purchase commitments also include $206 million for technology license agreements that require periodic payments through 2009 as well as non-cancelable contractual obligations to purchase raw materials, natural resources and office supplies. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable without significant penalties are not included in the amount set forth in the table above. In connection with the acquisition of ATI, we made several commitments to the Minister of Industry under the Investment Canada Act including that we will: increase spending on research and development in Canada to a specified amount over the course of a three-year period when compared to ATI’s expenditures in this area in prior years; maintain Canadian employee headcount at specified levels by the end of the three-year anniversary of the acquisition; increase by a specified amount the number of our Canadian employees focusing on research and development; attain specified Canadian capital expenditures over a three-year period; maintain a presence in Canada via a variety of commercial activities for a period of five years; and nominate a Canadian for election to 83 Table of Contents our Board of Directors over the next five years. Our Canadian capital expenditures and research and development commitments are included in our aggregate unconditional purchase commitments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees of Indebtedness Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 31, 2006 related to underlying liabilities that are already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 and their expected expiration dates by year. No incremental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for these guarantees. For more information on these guarantees, see “Contractual Obligations” above. AmountsGuaranteed 2007 2008 2009 (In millions) Repurchase obligations to Fab 36 partners(1) $ 126 $ 42 $ 42 $ 42 Payment guarantees on behalf of consolidated subsidiaries(2) 142 142 — — Total guarantees $ 268 $ 184 $ 42 $ 42 (1) This amount represents the amount of silent partnership contributions that we are required to repurchase from the unaffiliated partners of AMD Fab 36 KG and is exclusive of the guaranteed rate of return of an aggregate of approximately $58 million. (2) This amount represents the payment obligation due to a supplier arising out of the purchase of equipment by AMD Fab 36 KG. We guaranteed these payment obligations on behalf of AMD Fab 36 KG. At December 31, 2006, approximately $142 million was outstanding under this guarantee and recorded as a payable on our consolidated balance sheet. The obligation under the guarantee diminishes as the supplier is paid. Guarantees of Indebtedness not Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 31, 2006 for which the related underlying liabilities are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 and their expected expiration dates: AmountsGuaranteed(1) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 (In millions) AMTC revolving loan guarantee $ 42 $ 42 $ — $ — $ — $ — AMTC rental guarantee(2) 101 — — — — 101 Spansion operating and capital lease guarantees(3) 6 5 1 — — — Total guarantees $ 149 $ 47 $ 1 $ — $ — $ 101 (1) Amounts represent the principal amount of the underlying obligations guaranteed and are exclusive of obligations for interest, fees and expenses. (2) Amount of the guarantee diminishes as the rent is paid. (3) We agreed to maintain its guarantees of these Spansion obligations. AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co., KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by us, Infineon Technologies AG and DuPont Photomasks, Inc. for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. In April 2005 DuPont Photomasks, Inc. was acquired by Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Toppan, named Toppan Photomasks, Inc. We procure advanced photomasks from AMTC and use them in manufacturing our microprocessors. To finance the project, BAC and AMTC entered into a $158 million revolving credit facility and a $99 million term loan in December 2002. Also in December 2002, in order to occupy the photomask facility, AMTC entered into a rental agreement with BAC. With regard to these commitments by BAC and AMTC, as of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed up to $42 million plus interest and expenses under the revolving loan, and up to $20 million, initially, under the rental 84 Table of Contents agreement. The obligations under the rental agreement guarantee diminish over time through 2011 as the term loan is repaid. However, under certain circumstances of default by the other tenant of the photomask facility under its rental agreement with BAC and certain circumstances of default by more than one joint venture partner under its rental agreement guarantee obligations, the maximum potential amount of our obligations under the rental agreement guarantee is $101 million. As of December 31, 2006, $91 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility, and $54 million was drawn under the term loan. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the guarantees because they were issued prior to December 31, 2002, the effective date of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). Spansion Capital and Operating Lease Guarantee We guaranteed capital and operating leases entered into by Spansion and its subsidiaries totaling $6 million as of December 31, 2006. The amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by Spansion over the lease terms. No liability has been recognized for these guarantees related to Spansion under the provisions of FIN 45 because we concluded the fair value of the guarantees is not significant after considering various factors including Spansion’s credit rating, the ability of Spansion to make the payments on these obligations and the short maturity of the indebtedness. Other Financial Matters AMD/Spansion Service Agreements. We are party to various service agreements with Spansion. Under our IT Services Agreement and General Services Agreement, we provide, among other things, facilities, logistics, tax, finance and human resources services to Spansion. For services rendered, we are paid fees in an amount equal to cost plus five percent except for services procured by us from third parties, which are provided to Spansion at cost. Unless otherwise earlier terminated, each of these service agreements expires on June 30, 2007, but each of us may extend the term by mutual agreement. Spansion has the ability to terminate individual services under the general services agreements at any time and for any reason upon at least six months’ advance notice. With respect to the IT service agreements and general service agreements, if we failed to comply with applicable service levels for a particular service and have not rectified such performance failure, Spansion may terminate such service after 60 days have elapsed since Spansion first notified us of the failure to perform the service. Moreover, Spansion may terminate an entire IT service agreement or general services agreement if we breach our material obligations under the respective agreement and do not cure the default within 90 days after receipt of a notice of default from Spansion. Similarly, we can terminate the respective agreement for Spansion’s failure to make payments when due if Spansion fails to cure such default within 90 days after receipt of notice of default. As of December 31, 2006, we have substantially provided to Spansion the agreed upon services referred to above under the IT Services and General Services Agreements and as a result we expect the services provided in 2007 and beyond to be minimal. Outlook Our outlook disclosure is based on current expectations and contains forward-looking statements. Reference should be made to “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of Part I, Item I—Business. For a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in the following disclosure, see the “Financial Condition” and “Risk Factors” sections in this report and such other risks and uncertainties as set forth in this report or detailed in our other Securities and Exchange Commission reports and filings. In a seasonally down first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. Also, during the first quarter of 2007, we expect operating expenses, which include research and development expenses 85 Table of Contents and marketing, sales and administrative expenses, to be in the range of $830 million to $880 million, which includes ATI restructuring charges and stock option expense. ATI acquisition related charges will be approximately $120 million in the first quarter, of which $90 million is included in the operating expense amount previously mentioned and $30 million will be recorded to cost of sales. We expect employee stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter to be approximately $32 million. We also expect 2007 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.5 billion. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the EITF reached a final consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-2 Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences. Under this consensus, sabbatical leave or other similar benefits provided to an employee are considered to accumulate, as that term is used in SFAS 43, provided that (a) the employee is required to complete a minimum service period to be entitled to the benefit, (b) there is no increase to the benefit if the employee provides additional years of service, (c) the employee continues to be a compensated employee during his or her absence, and (d) the employer does not require the employee to perform any duties during his or her absence. If these conditions are met, companies are required to accrue for sabbatical leave or other similar benefits as they are earned. The accounting required under this consensus will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Upon adoption, companies can choose to apply the guidance using either of the following approaches: (a) a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all periods presented, or (b) a change in accounting principle through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance in retained earnings at the beginning of the year of adoption. We adopted the new accounting requirement on January 1, 2007, and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $24 million to our beginning retained earnings balance. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. It prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosures. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The provisions of FIN 48 apply to all tax positions upon initial adoption of FIN 48. Only tax positions that meet the recognition threshold criteria at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year unless the adjustment relates to tax positions taken by an acquired entity that existed at the time of the acquisition, in which case the adjustment would be recorded to goodwill. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of FIN 48 and expect to adopt it as required at the beginning of our fiscal year of 2007. In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but clarifies the fair value definition, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 clarifies that the fair value is the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market. It emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement and a fair value measurement should therefore be based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. SFAS 157 expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition, including the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of such measurements on earnings for the period. It will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years with earlier application encouraged. We are currently evaluating the accounting and disclosure requirements of SFAS 157 and plan to adopt it as required at the beginning of our fiscal year of 2008. 86 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 31, 2006, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were highly liquid investments and consisted primarily of bank notes, short-term corporate notes, money market auction rate preferred stocks and short-term federal agency notes. In October and December 2006, we borrowed $645 million and $248 million in U.S. dollars under the Fab 36 Term Loan. Interest is payable on this loan at a variable rate which is calculated as the aggregate of the applicable margin, (as defined in the Fab 36 Term Loan) plus LIBOR plus minimum reserve cost if any. We may select an interest period of one, two or three months or any other period agreed between AMD Fab 36 KG and the lenders. The rate of interest is reset at the beginning of each new interest period. As of December 31, 2006, the rate of interest was 7.1259 percent for the first drawdown and 7.11563 percent for the second drawdown. In addition, in October 2006, we borrowed an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion under the October 2006 Term Loan in order to finance a portion of the ATI acquisition. Interest is payable on this loan at a variable rate which is calculated as the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan) plus a 2.25 percent margin. The margin will reduce by 0.25 percent when the outstanding aggregate principal amount is less than $1.75 billion. We may select an interest period of one, two, three, six or if available to all the lenders, nine or twelve months for each loan. The rate of interest is reset at the beginning of each new interest period. As of December 31, 2006, $2.2 billion was outstanding and the interest rate was 7.62 percent. Because the Fab 36 Term Loan and the October 2006 Term Loan both bear a variable interest rate, our exposure to interest rate risk has increased significantly. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. Except for the October 2006 Term Loan, which was used to fund a portion of the ATI acquisition, we generally use proceeds from borrowings primarily to support general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital needs. 87 Table of Contents The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 31, 2006 and comparable fair values as of December 25, 2005: Fiscal2007 Fiscal2008 Fiscal2009 Fiscal2010 Fiscal2011 Thereafter Total Fiscal2006 FairValue Fiscal2005 FairValue (In millions except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 1,164 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,164 $ 1,164 $ 488 Weighted-average rate 5.16 % — — — — — 5.16 % 5.16 % 3.68 % Variable rate amounts $ 84 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 84 $ 84 $ 50 Weighted-average rate 5.26 % — — — — — 5.26 % 5.26 % 4.21 % Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts $ 15 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 15 $ 15 $ 938 Weighted-average rate 5.38 % — — — — — 5.38 % 5.38 % 6.15 % Variable rate amounts $ 146 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 146 $ 146 $ 224 Weighted-average rate 5.35 % — — — — — 5.35 % 5.35 % 4.31 % Long-term investments: Equity investments $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1 $ 1 $ 4 $ 7 Fixed rate amounts $ 13 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 13 $ 13 $ 13 Weighted-average rate 5.29 % — — — — — 5.29 % 5.29 % 3.86 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,422 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1 $ 1,423 $ 1,426 $ 1,720 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ 43 $ 44 $ 44 $ 1 $ 1 $ 395 $ 528 $ 542 $ 1,410 Weighted-average rate 12.76 % 12.76 % 12.73 % 6.86 % 6.86 % 7.74 % 8.98 % 8.75 % 6.94 % Variable rate amounts $ 76 $ 201 $ 290 $ 326 $ 111 $ 2,105 $ 3,109 $ 3,109 $ — Weighted-average rate 7.26 % 7.17 % 7.15 % 7.14 % 7.21 % 7.62 % 7.47 % 7.47 % — Total Debt Obligations $ 119 $ 245 $ 334 $ 327 $ 112 $ 2,500 $ 3,637 $ 3,651 $ 1,410 Foreign Exchange Risk. As of December 31, 2006, as a result of our foreign operations, we have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro and Canadian dollars. For example, some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of ATI in October 2006, some of our expenses and debt are denominated in Canadian dollars. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Commencing from December 26, 2005, we changed the functional currency for our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony Limited Liability Company & Co. KG and AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co KG, from the euro to the U.S. dollar following an evaluation of the scope of their operations and business practices. We concluded that the U.S. dollar is the currency of the primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate. However, we cannot give any assurance as to the effect that future changes in foreign currency rates will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows because certain locally incurred expenses of these subsidiaries continue to be denominated in euro, thereby still subjecting us to foreign currency risk. We will continue to monitor and to hedge this foreign risk exposure as appropriate. Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 31, 2006 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated 88 Table of Contents financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. In particular, generally we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005. All of our foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts mature within 12 months.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 29, 2007 and December 31, 2006 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2007 and related notes thereto, which are included in this Form 10-K. Introduction We are a global semiconductor company with facilities around the world. Within the global semiconductor industry, we offer primarily: • x86 microprocessors, for the commercial and consumer markets, embedded microprocessors for commercial, commercial client and consumer markets and chipsets for desktop and notebook personal computers, or PCs, professional workstations and servers; • graphics, video and multimedia products for desktop and notebook computers, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers; and • products for consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones and digital televisions and technology for game consoles. Prior to the closing of the IPO of Spansion Inc. on December 21, 2005, which is described in more detail below, we also manufactured and sold Flash memory devices through Spansion LLC, our former majority-owned subsidiary. In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations for AMD and its consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2007 compared to 2006 and 2006 compared to 2005, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. Our results of operations include sales of graphics, video, multimedia and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices from the effective date of the ATI acquisition on October 25, 2006 through December 29, 2007 in the following reportable segments: (i) Computing Solutions (including Chipsets), (ii) Graphics and (iii) Consumer Electronics. We are not able to provide any comparative information for the latter two segments prior to the ATI acquisition, since we did not participate in these markets. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Overview Fiscal 2007 was a challenging year for AMD. Our net revenue in 2007 of $6.0 billion increased six percent from net revenue of $5.6 billion in 2006. However, revenue increased because we included the operations of our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments for the entire fiscal year rather than just nine weeks in 2006. Net revenue for our Computing Solutions segment decreased 12 percent due to lower average selling prices for our microprocessor products, which resulted from delays in the introduction and broad availability of our quad-core processors, aggressive pricing by our principal competitor and a higher concentration of sales of processors for desktop and notebook PCs in 2007. Correspondingly, gross margins in 2007 decreased compared to gross margins in 2006 as a result of lower average selling prices for our microprocessor products and increased manufacturing costs during the first half of 2007. Furthermore, gross margins were adversely impacted due to the consolidation of ATI’s operations into ours for the full fiscal year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. Historically, the ATI business had lower gross margins compared to AMD. Despite the challenges that we encountered during 2007, we made positive strides towards improving our performance. Although average selling prices for our microprocessor products declined in 2007 compared to 2006, they improved in the second half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2007 as our product mix improved 48 Table of Contents with the introduction of our AMD Opteron quad-core processors for servers and AMD Phenom 9000 series of quad-core processors for desktop PCs. We also secured a new OEM customer, Toshiba Corporation. In the Graphics segment, we introduced the ATI Radeon HD 2000 and 3800 series of products. We also introduced the ATI Mobility Radeon HD series of products for notebook PCs during the second half of 2007 and were able to secure a number of OEM design wins. These new product introductions favorably impacted average selling prices. In the second half of 2007, we also improved gross margins compared to the first half of 2007 due to improved inventory management, manufacturing efficiencies and a richer product mix driven by the launch of new products. We also focused on improving the delivery of products across a diverse set of customers and geographies on a timely basis and, as a result, we witnessed recovery of sales to the distribution channel. In 2007, we also undertook measures to improve our financial position. During the second quarter of 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Notes and in the third quarter of 2007, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Notes. We used a portion of the proceeds from the 6.00% Notes and all of the proceeds from the 5.75% Notes to repay in full the amount outstanding under the October 2006 term loan agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we sold and issued 49 million shares of our common stock to a wholly owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company in exchange for net proceeds of $608 million. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 29, 2007 totaled $1.9 billion and our debt and capital lease obligations totaled $5.3 billion. We also made significant strides to implement our manufacturing capacity strategy. We converted Fab 36 to 65-nanometer process technology by mid-2007, as planned. We also expanded manufacturing capacity in Fab 36 and completed the addition of a new bump and test facility. We initiated the conversion of Fab 30 from a 200-millimeter to a 300-millimeter manufacturing facility. Fab 30 produced its final 200-millimeter wafer during the fourth quarter of 2007. During 2007, Chartered Semiconductor continued to manufacture AMD64-based processors for us to support incremental demand. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. ATI Acquisition On October 25, 2006, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of ATI, a publicly held company headquartered in Markham, Ontario, Canada for a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. ATI was engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of innovative 3D graphics and digital media silicon solutions. We believe that the acquisition of ATI will allow us to deliver products that better fulfill the increasing demand for more integrated computing solutions. We included the operations of ATI in our consolidated financial statements beginning on October 25, 2006. 49 Table of Contents The aggregate consideration that we paid for all outstanding ATI common shares consisted of approximately $4.3 billion of cash and 58 million shares of our common stock. In addition, we also issued options to purchase approximately 17.1 million shares of our common stock and approximately 2.2 million comparable AMD restricted stock units in exchange for outstanding ATI stock options and restricted stock units. The vested portion of these options and restricted stock units was valued at approximately $144 million. The unvested portion, valued at approximately $69 million, is being amortized to compensation expense over the options’ remaining vesting periods. To finance a portion of the cash consideration paid, we borrowed $2.5 billion under the October 2006 Term Loan. This term loan was fully repaid in 2007 (See “Contractual Obligations”). The total purchase price for ATI was $5.6 billion, including acquisition-related costs of $25 million, and consisted of: (In millionsexcept pershareamounts) Acquisition of all of the outstanding shares, stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards of ATI in exchange for: Cash $ 4,263 58 million shares of AMD common stock 1,172 Fair value of vested options and restricted stock units issued 144 Acquisition related transaction costs 25 Total purchase price $ 5,604 Purchase Price Allocation The total purchase price was allocated to ATI’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of October 24, 2006 as set forth below: (In millions) Cash and marketable securities $ 500 Accounts receivable 290 Inventories 431 Goodwill 3,217 Developed product technology 752 Game console royalty agreement 147 Customer relationships 257 Trademarks and trade names 62 Customer backlog 36 In-process research and development 416 Property, plant and equipment 143 Other assets 25 Accounts payable and other liabilities (631 ) Reserves for exit costs (8 ) Debt and capital lease obligations (31 ) Deferred revenues (2 ) Total purchase price $ 5,604 The only item that may significantly impact goodwill is the resolution of certain ATI tax-related contingencies. To the extent that the actual amounts are different than the estimated amounts initially recorded, the difference will result in an adjustment to goodwill. Any other adjustments to amounts recorded from and after the completion of the acquisition will be recorded in post-acquisition operating results. Management performed an analysis to determine the fair value of each tangible and identifiable intangible asset, including the portion of the purchase price attributable to acquired in-process research and development projects. 50 Table of Contents In-Process Research and Development Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. These projects include development of next generation GPU, chipset, handheld and digital TV products. As of the date of acquisition, the estimated fair value of the projects for the Graphics and Chipsets segment was approximately $193 million ($122 million for graphics products and $71 million for chipset products) and we expect to incur an aggregate of approximately $113 million ($86 million for graphics products and $27 million for chipset products) to complete these projects over the two-year period that commenced October 25, 2006. As of the date of the acquisition, the estimated fair value of the projects for the Consumer Electronics segment was approximately $223 million, and we expect to incur aggregate costs of approximately $102 million to complete these projects over the two-year period that commenced October 25, 2006. Starting in the first quarter of 2007, in conjunction with the integration of ATI’s operations, we reported operations related to our chipset products in our Computing Solutions segment. The value assigned to IPR&D was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, specifically an excess earnings approach, which estimates value based upon the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the in-process projects, net of all contributory asset returns. The approach includes consideration of the importance of each project to the overall development plan and estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by ATI and its competitors. The discount rates applied to individual projects were selected after consideration of the overall estimated weighted average cost of capital and the discount rates applied to the valuation of the other assets acquired. Such weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market acceptance and penetration, market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets. In developing the estimated fair values, we used discount rates ranging from 14 percent to 15 percent. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats from our competitors. Failure to develop these technologies into commercially viable products and/or failure to bring them to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results, could negatively impact the return on investment that we expected at the time that the ATI acquisition was completed and may result in impairment charges. The estimates used in valuing IPR&D were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. The development efforts on these acquired projects have been ongoing and there have not been any significant changes in the original development plans as of December 29, 2007. Other Acquisition Related Intangible Assets Developed product technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and includes technology in ATI’s discrete GPU products, integrated chipset products, handheld products, and digital TV product divisions. We initially expected the developed technology to have an average useful life of five years. However, as discussed below, we have revised the estimate of the average useful life of the developed technology to be 50 months from the acquisition date. 51 Table of Contents Game console royalty agreements represent agreements existing as of October 24, 2006 with video game console manufacturers for the payment of royalties to ATI for intellectual property design work performed and were estimated to have an average useful life of five years. Customer relationship intangibles represent ATI’s customer relationships existing as of October 24, 2006, and were estimated to have an average useful life of four years. Trademarks and trade names have an estimated useful life of seven years. Customer backlog represents customer orders existing as of October 24, 2006 that had not been delivered and were estimated to have a useful life of 14 months. We determined the fair value of other acquisition-related intangible assets using income approaches based on the most current financial forecast available as of October 24, 2006. The discount rates we used to discount net cash flows to their present values ranged from 12 percent to 15 percent. We determined these discount rates after consideration of our estimated weighted average cost of capital and the estimated internal rate of return specific to the acquisition. We based estimated useful lives for the other acquisition-related intangible assets on historical experience with technology life cycles, product roadmaps and our intended future use of the intangible assets. Integration Concurrent with the acquisition, we implemented an integration plan which included the termination of some ATI employees, the relocation or transfer to other sites of other ATI employees and the closure of duplicate facilities. The costs associated with employee severance and relocation totaled approximately seven million. The costs associated with the closure of duplicate facilities totaled approximately one million. These costs were included as a component of net assets acquired. Additionally, the integration plan also included termination of some AMD employees, cancellation of some existing contractual obligations, and other costs to integrate the operations of the two companies. We incurred costs of approximately $28 million and $32 million for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, and they are included in the caption, “Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges,” on our consolidated statements of operations. 2007 Impairment Analysis In the fourth quarter of 2007, pursuant to our accounting policy, we performed the annual goodwill impairment analysis. As a result of this analysis, we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill assigned to our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an impairment loss of approximately $1.3 billion, which is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” in our 2007 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to specific reporting units within these segments as of October 1, 2007, with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill, which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 13.1 percent to 15.3 percent. The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from our updated long-term financial forecast, which is developed as part of our strategic planning cycle conducted annually during the latter part of the third quarter. The decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and resulting impairment charge was primarily driven by our updated long-term financial forecasts, which showed lower estimated near-term and longer-term profitability compared to estimates we developed at the time of the completion of the acquisition. This updated long-term financial forecast represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable. However, actual performance in the 52 Table of Contents near-term and longer-term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in further impairment of goodwill. The outcome of our goodwill impairment analysis also indicated that the carrying amount of certain acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. Accordingly, we assessed the recoverability of the acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups, as appropriate, by determining whether the unamortized balances could be recovered through their respective estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. We determined that certain of the acquisition-related developed product technology associated with our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments was impaired primarily due to the revised lower revenue forecasts associated with products incorporating such developed product technology. We measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were based on projected discounted future net cash flows. As a result of this impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $349 million, which is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” in our 2007 consolidated statements of operations. We also revised our estimate of the weighted average useful life of the developed product technology from 60 months to 50 months based on the revised cash flow forecasts. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenues, inventories, asset impairments, goodwill, business combination, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near-term factory production planning. Generally, inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand for the next six months are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues 53 Table of Contents would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Business Combinations. In accordance with business combination accounting, we have allocated the purchase price of ATI to tangible and acquisition related intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to acquisition related intangible assets. We review the acquisition related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recovered. We made estimates of fair value of the ATI assets acquired and liabilities assumed using reasonable assumptions based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the acquisition related intangible assets included but were not limited to: future expected cash flows from the sale of products, expected costs to develop in-process research and development projects into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the market’s awareness of the acquired company’s brand and the acquired company’s market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio and discount rates. Unanticipated events may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results as evidenced by the impairment charges we recorded with respect to goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the ATI acquisition. Goodwill. As a result of the ATI acquisition, we recorded goodwill on our books. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), we are required to review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more often if there are indicators of impairment present. We perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each year. The provisions of SFAS 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. As a result of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, we were required to recognize a $1.3 billion goodwill impairment charge in our 2007 statement of operations related to three of our reporting units in the Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units included: (a) cash flow periods of 10 years; (b) terminal values based upon terminal growth rates ranging from 3.0 percent to 7.0 percent; and (c) discount rates ranging from 13.1 percent to 15.3 percent which were based on our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the risks associated with the operations. A variance in the discount rate could have had a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill, which totaled $1.9 billion at December 29, 2007. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the 54 Table of Contents economic environment on our customer base, or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We consider quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we test for recoverability of the asset by determining whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. Significant judgment is involved in estimating future cash flows and deriving the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows and in evaluating the results of appraisals or other valuation methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results which also reduces the carrying basis of the related asset. The new carrying value of the related asset is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We also must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful life of the asset. We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. Results of Operations We review and assess operating performance using segment net revenues and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. and other, income taxes and minority interest. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. Prior to December 21, 2005, we had the following three reportable segments: • the Computation Products segment, which included microprocessor products for desktop and mobile PCs, servers and workstations and AMD chipset products; • the Memory Products segment, which included Spansion Flash memory products; and • the Personal Connectivity Solutions segment, which included embedded processors for global commercial and consumer markets. On December 21, 2005, Spansion completed its IPO. Following the IPO, our ownership interest in Spansion was reduced from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent of Spansion’s outstanding common stock. In 55 Table of Contents November 2006, we sold 21 million shares of Spansion’s Class A common stock in an underwritten public offering. As a result of this sale, as of December 31, 2006 we owned approximately 21 percent of Spansion’s outstanding common stock. During 2007, we further reduced our interest in Spansion by selling approximately 14 million additional shares of Spansion’s Class A common stock, leaving us with approximately 14 million shares, or a 10.4 percent ownership interest in Spansion’s outstanding common stock as of December 29, 2007. As a result of Spansion’s IPO, our financial results of operations included Spansion’s financial results of operations as a consolidated subsidiary through December 20, 2005. From December 21, 2005, Spansion’s operating results and financial position were not consolidated as part of our financial results. Instead, we applied the equity method of accounting to reflect our share of Spansion’s net loss from December 21, 2005 through September 20, 2007. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of Spansion’s net loss impacts our net income (loss). On September 20, 2007, we changed the accounting for our investment in Spansion from the equity method to accounting for this investment as “available-for-sale” marketable securities pursuant to FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity because we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over Spansion’s operations (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Effective September 20, 2007, we are required to mark the investment to its current market price and book an impairment charge to the investment through earnings if the loss related to the market price change is deemed to be other than temporary. Accordingly, our operating results for the years ended December 25, 2005, December 31, 2006, and December 29, 2007 related to our investment in Spansion are not fully comparable with each other. Following Spansion’s IPO, from December 26, 2005 through October 24, 2006, we had two reportable segments: • the Computation Products segment, which included microprocessors, AMD chipsets and related revenue; and • the Embedded Products segment, which included embedded processors and related revenue. As a result of the acquisition of ATI, effective October 25, 2006, we had the following four reportable segments: • the Computation Products segment, which included microprocessors, AMD chipsets and related revenue; • the Embedded Products segment, which included embedded processors and related revenue; • the Graphics and Chipsets segment, which included graphics, video and multimedia products and chipsets sold by ATI prior to the acquisition and related revenue; and • the Consumer Electronics segment, which included products used in handheld devices, digital televisions and other consumer electronics products as well as related revenue and revenue for royalties received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporated our technology. Starting in the first quarter of 2007, in conjunction with the integration of ATI’s operations into ours, we began reviewing and addressing operating performance using the following three reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which includes what was formerly the Computation Products segment and the Embedded Products segment, as well as revenue from sales of ATI chipsets; • the Graphics segment, which includes graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue; and • the Consumer Electronics segment, which includes products used in handheld devices, digital televisions and other consumer electronics products, as well as revenue from royalties received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporate our technology. In addition to the reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments 56 Table of Contents because we do not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the operating segments. Following the ATI acquisition, we began including employee stock-based compensation expense, profit sharing expense, ATI acquisition-related and integration charges and charges for goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the All Other category. Also, this category included the sale of Personal Internet Communicator (PIC) products from the third quarter of 2005 to the third quarter of 2006, when the manufacturing of PIC products ceased. We use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year. Prior to December 31, 2006, our fiscal year ended on the last Sunday in December. Commencing in 2007, our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 29, 2007 and December 25, 2005 each included 52 weeks, and the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of 53 weeks. References in this report to 2007, 2006 and 2005 shall refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. The following is a summary of our net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Computing Solutions Net revenue $ 4,702 $ 5,367 $ 3,929 Operating income (loss) (670 ) 680 586 Graphics Net revenue 903 166 — Operating income (loss) (100 ) (27 ) — Consumer Electronics Net revenue 408 120 — Operating income (loss) (17 ) 20 — Memory Products Net revenue — — 1,913 Operating income (loss) — — (311 ) All Other Net revenue — (4 ) 6 Operating income (loss) (2,078 ) (720 ) (43 ) Total Net revenue 6,013 5,649 5,848 Operating income (loss) $ (2,865 ) $ (47 ) $ 232 Computing Solutions Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2007 decreased by $665 million or 12 percent compared to net revenue of $5.4 billion in 2006 despite the inclusion of revenue from the sale of ATI chipsets for the full fiscal year in 2007 as compared to only nine weeks in 2006. Net revenue decreased as a result of a 32 percent decrease in average selling prices of products included in our Computing Solutions segment, partially offset by a 30 percent increase in unit shipments. The decrease in average selling prices was primarily caused by a decrease in the average selling prices of our microprocessor products. Microprocessor average selling prices decreased due to both competitive market conditions and a higher concentration of sales of processors for desktop and notebook PCs in 2007, which generally carry lower average selling prices than our processors for servers. In particular, our competitor first offered quad-core multi-chip module processors for servers and desktop PCs in November 2006, and these products were available throughout 2007. We first introduced our quad-core products for servers in August 2007 and for desktop PCs in November 2007. However, we did not achieve significant volume shipments of these products in 2007, and sales of these products did not significantly contribute to 2007 57 Table of Contents revenue. In light of the timing of our quad-core product introductions and their lack of broad availability during 2007, we discounted the selling price of certain competing processor products. Unit shipments increased primarily due to the inclusion of ATI chipset sales, which accounted for 76 percent of the increase, and increased customer demand for our microprocessors for notebook PCs, which accounted for 24 percent of the increase. However, we did achieve record unit shipments in 2007 with respect to our microprocessor products. Computing Solutions net revenue of $5.4 billion in 2006 increased $1.5 billion or 38 percent compared to net revenue of $3.9 billion in 2005. Although 2006 included revenue from sales of ATI chipsets from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006, it was not material. Net revenue increased as a result of a 39 percent increase in unit shipments of products included in our Computing Solutions segment. The increase in unit shipments in 2006 was caused primarily by an increase in unit shipments of our microprocessor products due to increased demand for processors in each of the desktop, server and mobile categories. However, we believe that the challenge we experienced with the ability of our supply chain to keep up with the increased demand across a diverse set of customers and geographies and to deliver products on a timely basis in the second half of 2006 had an adverse impact on microprocessor unit shipments. Moreover, despite a richer product mix in 2006, average selling prices remained relatively flat in 2006 as compared to 2005. Higher microprocessor average selling prices in the first half of 2006 were offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices in the second half of 2006 due to competitive market conditions. Specifically, in the second half of 2006 aggressive pricing by our principal competitor in an attempt to regain market share adversely impacted our microprocessor average selling prices. Our competitor also launched its quad-core multi-chip module processors in November 2006, and since we did not offer quad-core products during this period, we discounted the selling price of certain of our competing products during the fourth quarter, which adversely impacted our microprocessor average selling prices, margins and profitability. Computing Solutions operating loss was $670 million in 2007 compared to operating income of $680 million in 2006. The operating loss was primarily due to the $665 million decrease in revenue described above, a $307 million increase in manufacturing expenses, a $309 million increase in research and development expenses and a $69 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Manufacturing expenses increased primarily due to increased volumes of microprocessors, a shift to higher-end microprocessors and the inclusion of ATI’s chipset business in the Computing Solutions segment for a full year in 2007, as opposed to only nine weeks in 2006. Computing Solutions operating income of $680 million in 2006 increased by $94 million, or 16 percent, compared to operating income of $586 million in 2005. This increase was primarily due to a 38 percent increase in net revenue, partially offset by an increase in manufacturing expenses of $856 million, an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses of $265 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $219 million. Manufacturing expenses increased primarily to support higher sales volume. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Graphics Graphics net revenue and operating loss in 2007 were $903 million and $100 million, respectively. Graphics net revenue and operating loss for the period of October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006 were $166 million and $27 million, respectively. The increases in revenue and operating losses were due to the inclusion of the operations attributable to the Graphics segment for the full year in 2007 compared to only nine weeks in 2006. We did not sell comparable products prior to the ATI acquisition. Graphics net revenue in the second half of 2007 increased 30 percent over the first half of 2007 due to the successful introduction of new products. From the first half of 2007 to the second half of 2007 unit shipments increased by 19 percent and average selling prices increased by 9 percent. The improvement in net revenue was the primary driver that significantly narrowed the operating loss from the first half of 2007 to the second half of 2007. We did not sell comparable products prior to the ATI acquisition. 58 Table of Contents Consumer Electronics Consumer Electronics net revenue and operating loss in 2007 were $408 million and $17 million, respectively. Consumer Electronics net revenue and operating income for the period from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006 were $120 million and $20 million, respectively. The increase in revenue was due to the inclusion of operations attributable to the Consumer Electronics segment for the full year in 2007 compared to only nine weeks in 2006. The 2007 operating loss resulted primarily from significantly lower unit shipments in the second quarter of 2007 due to decreased demand from a key OEM customer. This demand recovered moderately during the remainder of the year. Consumer Electronics net revenue was flat in the second half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2007. A decrease in revenue from sales of products used in handheld devices was offset by an increase in revenue from royalties on game consoles. Due to the seasonal increase in royalties on game consoles in the second half of 2007, the operating loss for the first half of 2007 improved slightly to an operating profit for the second half of 2007. We did not sell comparable products prior to the ATI acquisition. Memory Products As a result of Spansion’s IPO in December 2005, we stopped manufacturing and selling memory products. Therefore, we did not have a Memory Products segment in 2006 and 2007. All Other Category We did not have any net revenue for the All Other category in 2007. All Other net revenue in 2006 decreased by $10 million from 2005, primarily because we had minimal revenue from sales of PIC products and customers returned previously sold PIC products. Effective as of the third quarter of 2006, we ceased production of PIC products. All Other operating loss of $2.1 billion in 2007 increased by $1.4 billion compared to an operating loss of $720 million in 2006. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related impairment charges of $1.6 billion, which included a goodwill write-down of $1.3 billion and a write-down of specific intangible assets of $349 million and an increase of $224 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in ATI integration charges of $453 million. Integration charges in 2006 included $416 million in expenses for acquired in-process research and development, which did not recur in 2007. See Part II, Item 7 “MD&A—ATI Acquisition.” All Other operating loss of $720 million in 2006 increased by $677 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million in 2005. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related charges of $557 million and an increase in employee stock-based compensation expense and profit sharing expense of $104 million. ATI acquisition-related charges included an in-process research and development write-off of $416 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $47 million, cost of fair value adjustments to acquired inventory of $62 million and a $32 million charge associated with the integration of ATI’s operations, which included termination of some AMD employees, cancellation of some existing contractual obligations and other costs that we incurred to integrate the operations of the two companies. 59 Table of Contents Comparison of Gross Margin, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net, Income Taxes and Other Expenses The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 29, 2007, December 31, 2006, and December 25, 2005: 2007 2006 2005 (In millions except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 3,751 $ 2,856 $ 3,456 Gross margin 2,262 2,793 2,392 Gross margin percentage 38 % 49 % 41 % Gross margin percentage excluding Memory Products 38 % 49 % 56 % Research and development $ 1,847 $ 1,205 $ 1,144 Marketing, general and administrative 1,373 1,140 1,016 In-process research and development — 416 — Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges 299 79 — Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 1,608 — — Interest income 73 116 37 Interest expense (367 ) (126 ) (105 ) Other income (expense), net (7 ) (13 ) (24 ) Equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. and other (155 ) (45 ) (107 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 23 23 (7 ) Gross Margin Gross margin decreased to 38 percent in 2007 compared to 49 percent in 2006 primarily due to significantly lower average selling prices for our microprocessor products in 2007 compared to 2006. Gross margin percentage in the first half of 2007 was also negatively impacted by higher manufacturing unit costs for our microprocessor products due to a shift in our product mix to higher-end microprocessors and increased depreciation expenses associated with the expansion of Fab 36. However, manufacturing efficiencies, improved inventory management, and a richer product mix in the second half of 2007 offset the unfavorable impact in the first half of 2007. On an annual basis, the inclusion of ATI’s lower margin operations in our consolidated operations adversely impacted our gross margins by approximately two percentage points. Gross margin increased to 49 percent in 2006 compared to 41 percent in 2005 because we did not consolidate Spansion’s results of operations, which historically had lower margins, with ours in 2006. Gross margin decreased to 49 percent in 2006 compared to gross margin, excluding the Memory Products segment, of 56 percent in 2005. Higher gross margins in the first half of 2006 were more than offset by lower gross margins in the second half of 2006. This decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased manufacturing unit costs and flat average selling prices due to competitive market conditions in the second half of 2006. The increase in manufacturing unit costs was primarily due to a shift in our product mix to higher-end microprocessor products. In addition, consolidated gross margin was adversely impacted by approximately two percentage points due to the consolidation of ATI’s operations into ours from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Gross margin was also adversely impacted by approximately one percentage point due to the costs of fair value adjustments related to the inventory we acquired through the ATI acquisition. We record grants and allowances that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 or Fab 36 as long-term liabilities on our consolidated financial statements. We amortize these amounts as they are earned as a reduction to operating expenses. We record the amortization of the production related grants and allowances as a credit to cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $138 million in 2007, $116 million in 2006, and $72 million in 2005. The fluctuations in the recognition of these credits have not significantly impacted our gross margins. 60 Table of Contents Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased $642 million, or 53 percent, from $1.2 billion in 2006 to $1.8 billion in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to: a $309 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment, a $186 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment and a $149 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Consumer Electronics segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment increased due primarily to higher product design costs for our next generation microprocessor products. In addition, research and development expenses attributable to ATI’s chipset business were included for the full year in 2007 compared to only nine weeks in 2006. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments increased primarily due to the inclusion of operations related to these segments for the full fiscal year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. Research and development expenses increased $61 million, or 5 percent, from $1.1 billion in 2005 to $1.2 billion in 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to: a $219 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment primarily due to an increase in silicon design, platform and product development costs for our microprocessor products partially offset by a $10 million lower corporate bonus expense, increases of $42 million and $31 million, respectively due to the consolidation of research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006, and a $51 million increase in stock-based compensation and profit sharing expenses. Fiscal 2006 research and development expenses were partially offset by the absence of research and development expenses related to Spansion’s operations because we did not consolidate Spansion’s results of operations into ours in 2006. In 2005, research and development expenses attributable to our Memory Products segment were $290 million. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. We record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances, as well as the research and development subsidies, as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $30 million in 2007, $27 million in 2006, and $44 million in 2005. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $233 million, or 20 percent, from $1.1 billion in 2006 to $1.4 billion in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to: a $69 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment, a $106 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, a $45 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Consumer Electronics segment, and an $11 million increase in severance charges for workforce reductions. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment increased due to expansion of marketing programs for our microprocessor products, increased legal expenses and additional investments in information technology, partially offset by a nine million reduction in corporate bonus expense. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments increased primarily due to the inclusion of the operations related to these segments for the full fiscal year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $124 million, or 12 percent, from one billion in 2005 to $1.1 billion in 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to a $265 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment primarily due to: a $215 million increase in marketing, branding and cooperative advertising costs for our microprocessor products, 61 Table of Contents partially offset by $18 million lower corporate bonus expense, increases of $20 million and eight million, respectively, due to the consolidation of marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments from October 25, 2006 to December 31, 2006, and a $44 million increase in stock-based compensation and profit sharing expenses. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses were partially offset by the absence of marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to Spansion’s operations because we did not consolidate Spansion’s results of operations into ours in 2006. In 2005, marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Memory Products segment were $208 million. In-process research and development, amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges, and impairment to goodwill and acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges in 2007 included amortization of $271 million and integration charges of $28 million. During 2007, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 billion associated with our goodwill and acquired intangible assets. See Part II, Item 7 “MD&A—“ATI Acquisition.” In-process research and development charges of $416 million in 2006 related to projects acquired in connection with the acquisition of ATI. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges in 2006 included amortization of $47 million and integration charges of $32 million. See Part II, Item 7 “MD&A—“ATI Acquisition.” Effects of 2002 Restructuring Plan In December 2002, we began implementing a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry-wide excess inventory. The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities that we currently occupy under long-term operating leases through 2011. At December 29, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had approximately $50 million and $67 million of related vacated facility lease accruals recorded which will continue to be paid through 2011. Interest Income Interest income of $73 million in 2007 decreased $43 million from $116 million in 2006, primarily due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances in 2007 compared to 2006, partially offset by a 7 percent increase in weighted-average interest rates in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest income of $116 million in 2006 increased from $37 million in 2005, primarily due to an increase in average cash and marketable securities during 2006 compared to 2005 and a 54 percent increase in weighted-average interest rates. Interest Expense 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Total interest charges $ 390 $ 136 $ 140 Less: interest capitalized (23 ) (10 ) (35 ) Interest expense $ 367 $ 126 $ 105 62 Table of Contents Interest expense of $367 million in 2007 increased $241 million from $126 million in 2006 primarily due to increased outstanding indebtedness as follows: • Interest expense incurred on our 6.00% Notes issued in April 2007 and our 5.75% Notes issued in August 2007, which were not outstanding in 2006, was $93 million and $35 million, respectively; • Interest expense incurred on the Fab 36 Term Loan increased by $61 million because we incurred a full year of interest expense in 2007 as opposed to approximately 11 weeks in 2006; • Interest expense incurred on the October 2006 Term Loan increased by $56 million because we incurred interest expense through August 2007, or almost three full quarters in 2007, as opposed to only nine weeks of interest expense in 2006; and • Interest expense incurred on capital lease payments was approximately $11 million higher in 2007 due to increased assets acquired under capital leases. These increases were offset by the following reductions in interest expense: • Capitalized interest expense, which was primarily related to the continuing expansion of Fab 36, was two million higher in 2007 compared to 2006; and • Capitalized interest expense in connection with new projects in 2007, including construction of our new campus in Austin, Texas of six million and the Fab 38 facility in Dresden, Germany of five million. Interest expense of $126 million in 2006 increased $21 million from $105 million in 2005 primarily for the following reasons: • Interest expense incurred on the October 2006 Term Loan and the Fab 36 Term Loan was $38 million and $10 million. These loans were not outstanding in 2005; • Interest expense incurred on capital lease payments was approximately $11 million higher in 2006 due to increased assets acquired under capital leases; and • Capitalized interest expense, which was primarily related to Fab 36, was $25 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005. These factors were offset by the following factors: • During 2006 we did not consolidate Spansion’s results of operations, and therefore interest expense on Spansion’s third-party debt, which was $24 million for 2005, was not included in 2006; • Interest expense incurred on our 4.75% Debentures decreased by $21 million in 2006 compared to 2005 because holders of the 4.75% Debentures converted their debentures into shares of our common stock during the first quarter of 2006, whereas during 2005, $500 million of the aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Debentures was outstanding; and • Interest expense incurred on our 7.75% Notes decreased by $13 million because we redeemed $210 million of the aggregate principal amount outstanding during the first quarter of 2006. In September 2007, the FASB exposed for comment a proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. APB 14-a, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (including partial cash settlement). This proposed FSP would change the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments, including our 6.00% Notes. Under the proposed new rules, for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The effect of the proposed new rules for our 6.00% Notes is that the equity component would be included in the paid-in-capital portion of stockholders’ equity on our balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 6.00% Notes. Higher interest 63 Table of Contents expense would result by recognizing accretion of the discounted carrying value of the 6.00% Notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of the 6.00% Notes. If issued as proposed, the final FSP would provide final guidance effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, would not permit early application, and would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. In November 2007, the FASB announced that it expected to begin its redeliberations of the proposed FSP in January 2008. Therefore, it is highly unlikely the proposed effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 will be retained. We cannot predict the exact accounting treatment that will be imposed (which may differ from the foregoing description) or when any change will be finally implemented. However, if the final FSP is issued as exposed, we expect to have higher interest expense starting in the period of adoption due to the interest expense accretion and, if the retrospective application provisions of the proposed FSP are retained in the final FSP, the prior period interest expense associated with the 6.00% Notes would be higher than previously reported due to the retrospective application. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, of an expense of seven million in 2007 decreased six million from an expense of $13 million in 2006 primarily due to a gain of $19 million on the sale of vacant land in Sunnyvale, California in 2007 and six million less in finance charges related to the Fab 36 Term Loan as compared to 2006. This decrease was offset by a non-recurring gain of $10 million associated with Spansion LLC’s repurchase of its 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 in 2006, a higher net charge of two million in 2007 due to charges for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred in connection with our repayment of the October 2006 Term Loan and a reduction of seven million in other income due primarily to impairment charges on an investment recorded in 2007. Other income (expense), net, of an expense of $13 million in 2006 decreased by $11 million as compared with an expense of $24 million in 2005 primarily due to: a non-recurring loss of approximately $10 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 resulting from the mark-to-market to earnings of certain foreign currency forward contracts which became ineffective in hedging against certain forecasted foreign currency transactions; a gain of $10 million associated with Spansion LLC’s repurchase of its 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 in 2006; an increase in other income of nine million primarily related to a gain on an investment and lower finance charges related to the Fab 36 Term Loan of two million in 2006 as compared to 2005. The decrease was offset by a charge of $16 million related to a debt redemption premium and a charge of four million related to unamortized issuance costs incurred in connection with our redemption of 35 percent of the principal outstanding amount, or $210 million, of our 7.75% Notes in 2006. Equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. and other Prior to Spansion’s IPO, we held a 60 percent controlling ownership interest in Spansion. Consequently, Spansion’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows through December 20, 2005 were included in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. Following the IPO, our ownership interest was diluted from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent, and we no longer exercised control over Spansion’s operations. Therefore, starting from December 21, 2005, we used the equity method of accounting to account for our investment in Spansion. In connection with the reduction in our ownership interest in Spansion, we recorded a loss of $110 million in 2005, which represents the difference between Spansion’s book value per share before and after the IPO multiplied by the number of shares we owned. In addition, in 2005 we also wrote off approximately $16 million in goodwill which was originally recorded in June 30, 2003 as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC. In November 2006, we sold 21,000,000 shares of Spansion Class A common stock in an underwritten public offering. We received $278 million in net proceeds from the offering and realized a gain of six million from the 64 Table of Contents sale. After the offering, we owned approximately 21 percent of Spansion’s outstanding common stock. We continued to use the equity method of accounting to account for our investment in Spansion. During the first quarter of 2007, we sold 984,799 shares of Spansion Class A common stock. We received $13 million in net proceeds from the sales and realized a gain of $0.6 million. In July 2007, we sold 12,506,694 additional shares of Spansion Class A common stock. We received $144 million in net proceeds from these sales and realized a loss of two million. We continued to use the equity method of accounting to account for our investment in Spansion because, for accounting purposes, we were deemed to continue to have the ability to exercise significant influence over Spansion. On September 20, 2007, Dr. Ruiz, our Chief Executive Officer, resigned as Chairman of Spansion’s Board of Directors. We also transferred our one share of Class B common stock to Spansion and, accordingly, relinquished the right to appoint a director to Spansion’s Board of Directors. Therefore, we changed our accounting for our investment from the equity method of accounting to accounting for this investment as “available-for-sale” marketable securities. After giving consideration to Spansion’s operating results, its stock price changes in the preceding six months, and our intention to liquidate our investment, we concluded that this investment was other than temporarily impaired as of September 29, 2007 and again as of December 29, 2007. Therefore, we recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $111 million in 2007, reflecting a write-down of this investment to its fair market value of $56 million. As of December 29, 2007, we owned a total of 14,037,910 shares, or approximately 10.4 percent, of Spansion’s outstanding common stock. The $56 million carrying value of this investment is included in the caption “Marketable Securities” on our consolidated balance sheet dated December 29, 2007. To the extent that the fair value of our investment in Spansion changes in the future due to fluctuations in Spansion’s common stock price, we would record either an unrealized loss or an unrealized gain within “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,” a component of stockholders’ equity on our balance sheet. Should we sell our shares of Spansion in the future, we would record either a realized loss or a realized gain. In addition, to the extent that we conclude that any unrealized loss is other-than-temporary, we would record further impairment charges through earnings. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $23 million in each of 2007 and 2006 and a tax provision benefit of seven million in 2005. The income tax provision in 2007 primarily resulted from current foreign taxes reduced by the reversal of deferred U.S. taxes related to indefinite-lived goodwill, resulting from the goodwill impairment charge we recorded during the year, and recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for tax holidays. The income tax provision in 2006 primarily results from current foreign taxes, plus deferred U.S. taxes related to indefinite-lived goodwill, and reduced by deferred foreign benefits from removing part of the valuation allowance on German net operating loss carryovers of Fab 36. The income tax benefit in 2005 primarily reflects U.S. tax benefits realized from the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits and foreign tax benefits generated by Spansion in certain foreign jurisdictions. Spansion’s IPO did not have a material impact on our tax provision. As of December 29, 2007 substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continue to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 29, 2007 in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. Our gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by less than one million during the year ended December 29, 2007. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that will affect the effective tax rate decreased by nine million 65 Table of Contents during the year ended December 29, 2007, primarily due to the receipt of a retroactive tax holiday during the fourth quarter of the current year. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits decreased by a net $12 million and a net two million, respectively, for the year ended December 29, 2007. Substantially all of the net reduction in interest and penalties occurred in the third quarter of 2007 and was primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain foreign jurisdictions. During the 12 months beginning December 30, 2007, we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $43 million primarily from the expiration of certain statutes of limitation and audit resolutions. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. However, the resolution of and/or closure on open audits is highly uncertain. As of December 29, 2007, the Canadian Revenue Agency, or CRA, is auditing ATI for the years 2000—2004. The audit has been completed and currently is in the review process. As of December 29, 2007, we were not under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. However, an IRS audit of AMD’s tax years 2004 and 2005 is scheduled to commence in March 2008. AMD and its subsidiaries have several foreign, foreign provincial, and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time. We have provided for uncertain tax positions that require a FIN 48 liability. As a result of the application of FIN 48, we have recognized $61 million of current and long-term deferred tax assets, previously under a valuation allowance, with $61 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 29, 2007. 66 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation Expense On December 26, 2005, we adopted FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, based on estimated fair values. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we recognized stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, we changed our method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense from the multiple-option (i.e. accelerated) approach to the single option (i.e. straight-line) method. Also, upon adoption of SFAS 123R, we changed the method of valuing stock option awards from the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model, which was previously used for our pro forma information disclosures of stock-based compensation expense as required under FASB Statement No. 123, Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123) to a lattice-binomial option-pricing model. The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan under SFAS 123R for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 31, 2006, which we recorded in our consolidated results of operations as follows: Year Ended December 29,2007 Year Ended December 31,2006 ( In millions) Stock-based compensation included as a component of: Cost of sales $ 11 $ 8 Research and development 53 30 Marketing, general, and administrative 49 39 Total stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchases 113 77 Tax benefit — — Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchases, net of tax $ 113 $ 77 We recognized minimal stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 25, 2005. In anticipation of the adoption of SFAS 123R, beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we changed the quantity and type of instrument we primarily use in stock-based payment programs for our employees by shifting to granting more restricted stock units. Restricted stock units are awards that obligate us to issue a specific number of shares of our common stock if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. Restricted stock units based on continued service generally vest over three to four years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units based solely on performance conditions generally do not vest for at least one year from the date of grant. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, all employees below the level of vice president receive restricted stock units and employees at the vice president level and above receive grants of restricted stock units and stock options. As of December 29, 2007, we had $39 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.45 years. Also, as of December 29, 2007, we had $114 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 2.15 years. For additional information on stock-based compensation expense, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. On April 27, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all stock options outstanding under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and our prior equity compensation plans that had exercise prices per share higher than the closing price of our stock on April 27, 2005, which was $14.51. Options to purchase approximately 12 million shares of 67 Table of Contents our common stock became exercisable immediately. Options held by non-employee directors were not included in the vesting acceleration. The primary purpose for accelerating the vesting was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of SFAS 123R. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge because such options were out of the money. On December 15, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all outstanding AMD stock options and restricted stock units held by Spansion employees that would otherwise have vested from December 16, 2005 to December 31, 2006. In connection with the modification of the terms of these options to accelerate their vesting, we recorded $1.2 million as non-cash compensation expense on a pro forma basis in accordance with SFAS 123, and this amount was included in the pro forma stock compensation expense for the year ended December 25, 2005. The primary purpose for accelerating the vesting of these awards was to minimize future compensation expense that we and Spansion would otherwise have been required to recognize in Spansion’s and our respective statements of operations with respect to these awards. If we had not accelerated the vesting of these awards, they would have been subject to variable accounting in accordance with the guidance provided in EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Service and EITF Issue No. 00-12, Accounting by an Investor for Stock-Based Compensation Granted to Employees of an Equity Method Investee. This accounting treatment would have applied because following Spansion’s IPO, we no longer consolidated Spansion’s results of operations in our financial statements. Accordingly, Spansion employees were no longer considered our employees. Under variable fair value accounting, we would have been required to re-measure the fair value of unvested stock-based awards of our common stock held by Spansion employees after Spansion’s IPO at the end of each accounting period until such awards were fully vested. In connection with the acceleration of the vesting of these awards, we recorded a compensation charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 of $1.5 million, which was based on the estimated forfeiture rate of 7.94 percent. The actual forfeitures for 2006 were not materially different from the estimate used. International Sales International sales as a percent of net revenue were 87 percent in 2007, 75 percent in 2006 and 79 percent in 2005. The increase in international sales from 2006 to 2007 was attributable to the inclusion of sales of our graphics and chipsets products to contract manufacturers and add-in-board manufacturers based outside the United States, principally in China and Taiwan, for the full year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. In 2007 and 2006, primarily all of our net revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2005, approximately 14 percent of our net revenue was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 29, 2007 totaled $1.9 billion and our debt and capital lease obligations totaled $5.3 billion. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $310 million in 2007. Our net loss of $3.4 billion was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.6 billion of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible impairment charges, $1.3 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $154 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges on our investment in Spansion stock and $112 million of stock-based compensation expense. 68 Table of Contents These charges were partially offset by amortization to income of foreign grants and subsidies of $167 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 29, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 included a decrease of $503 million in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease of $321 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase of $134 million in prepaid and other current assets. Our accounts receivable balance decreased due to greater efficiency in management and collection of accounts receivables. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased due to the timing of payments partially offset by increases in accrued interest and accruals for technology license payment obligations. The increase in prepaid and other assets was driven by increases in receivables for foreign grants and subsidies, purchases of technology licenses and an increase in prepaid insurance. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. Our net loss of $166 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $837 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $416 million for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the ATI acquisition, stock-based compensation expense of $77 million, and $45 million related to an equity interest in the net loss of Spansion. These charges were partially offset by amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $151 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 25, 2005 included an increase of $530 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in payables to related parties of $229 million and an increase of $175 million in other assets. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily related to higher purchases of raw materials, technology license payment obligations, and marketing accruals due to increased operations in the Computing Solutions segment. The decrease in payables to related parties is a result of our no longer shipping products and invoicing customers on behalf of Spansion after the second quarter of 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we shipped products to and invoiced Spansion’s customers in our name on behalf of Spansion and remitted the receipts to Spansion. The increase in other assets was primarily due to purchases of new technology licenses. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion in 2005. Our net income of $165 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, a non-cash charge of approximately $110 million that we incurred as a result of the dilution of our ownership in Spansion from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent in conjunction with Spansion’s IPO, and a non-cash charge of $16 million in connection with our write-off of goodwill that was generated as of June 30, 2003 as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC on June 30, 2003. These charges were partially offset by minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries of $125 million and amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $110 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 31, 2005 compared to December 25, 2004 included increases of $313 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $206 million in payables to related parties, partially offset by a $276 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily attributable to the purchase of Fab 36 equipment. The increases in payables to related parties resulted from the separation of our operations from Spansion and the subsequent arrangement to ship and invoice customers on behalf of Spansion and remit the receipts to Spansion. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the deconsolidation of Spansion’s results of operations from ours as a result of Spansion’s IPO. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.7 billion in 2007. We used $1.7 billion to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $691 million to purchase equipment for Fab 36. We also purchased $545 million in available-for-sale securities. This was offset by $307 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, $157 million in proceeds from sales of Spansion shares, $73 million from sales of assets, including excess land in Sunnyvale, California and 200-millimeter wafer fabrication equipment and $18 million in other investing activities, consisting primarily of buyer deposits on assets to be sold. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $4.3 billion in 2006. We used $3.9 billion, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, to acquire ATI, and $1.9 billion to purchase property, plant and equipment, 69 Table of Contents including approximately $987 million to purchase equipment for Fab 36. This was partially offset by a net cash inflow of $947 million from sales and maturities of available for sale securities, $278 million from sales of Spansion shares, and $175 million of proceeds from Spansion’s repurchase of its 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $2.3 billion in 2005. We used $1.5 billion to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $726 million to construct and equip Fab 36. We also purchased a net amount of $885 million in available-for-sale securities, including a purchase of $175 million aggregate principal amount of Spansion’s 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes for approximately $159 million. We received $261 million in proceeds from Spansion’s repayment of amounts outstanding under promissory notes to us, partially offset by a decrease of $133 million in cash due to the deconsolidation of Spansion’s results of operations from ours. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $2.0 billion in 2007 and consisted primarily of proceeds of: $2.2 billion from the issuance and sale of our 6.00% Notes during the second quarter of 2007; $1.5 billion from the issuance and sale of our 5.75% Notes during the third quarter of 2007; $608 million from the sale of our common stock to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company in the fourth quarter of 2007; $78 million from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of employee stock options; and $223 million of capital investment grants and allowances received from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, chiefly for the Fab 36 project. These proceeds were partially offset by the $2.2 billion repayment of our October 2006 Term Loan, a payment of $182 million for the purchase of a capped call in connection with the issuance of our 6.00% Notes and a payment of $46 million for our mandatory repurchase of silent partner contributions from our unaffiliated partners in AMD Fab 36 KG. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $3.8 billion in 2006, and consisted primarily of proceeds of: $3.4 billion from borrowings under the October 2006 Term Loan and the Fab 36 Term Loan; proceeds of $495 million from the sale of our common stock in an equity offering; $231 million from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of employee stock options; and capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project of $210 million. These amounts were offset by $539 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, primarily due to our redemption of 35 percent of the aggregate principal amount outstanding (or $210 million) of our 7.75% Notes, and $284 million to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the October 2006 Term Loan. During 2006, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flow. Net cash provided by financing activities was $494 million in 2005. This amount included $186 million in proceeds from borrowings by Spansion and $60 million of silent partnership contributions from the unaffiliated partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, which we classify as debt, approximately $90 million in investments from these unaffiliated partners, $189 million in proceeds from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options; and capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project of $163 million and $129 million of proceeds from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by Spansion. These amounts were offset by $316 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations. Liquidity We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances at December 29, 2007, anticipated cash flows from operations and available external financing will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital investments in the next twelve months and over the longer term, including the approximately $1.1 billion we plan to spend for capital expenditures during fiscal 2008. Should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through 70 Table of Contents borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We believe that, in the event additional funding is required, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $300 million worth of our common stock over a period of time to be determined by management. These repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in compliance with applicable rules and regulations, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. We are not required to repurchase any particular amount of our common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. During fiscal 2007, we did not repurchase any of our equity securities pursuant to this Board authorized program. At this point in time we believe the current credit market difficulties do not have a material impact on our financial position or liquidity. However, a future degradation in credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual cash obligations at December 29, 2007, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period Total Fiscal2008 Fiscal2009 Fiscal2010 Fiscal2011 Fiscal2012 Fiscal 2013and beyond (In millions) 5.75% Senior Notes due 2012 $1,500 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,500 $— 6.00% Senior Notes due 2015 2,200 — — — — — 2,200 Fab 36 Term Loan 839 179 268 303 89 — — Repurchase obligations to Fab 36 Partners(1) 94 47 47 — — — — 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 390 — — — — 390 — Other debt 12 2 2 2 2 2 2 Other long-term liabilities 130 2 68 42 — — 18 Aggregate interest obligation(2) 1,659 315 291 266 250 218 319 Obligations under capital leases(3) 454 42 42 42 42 42 244 Operating leases 343 73 61 55 29 25 100 Unconditional purchase commitments(4) 2,256 666 500 268 257 93 472 Total contractual obligations $ 9,877 $ 1,326 $ 1,279 $ 978 $ 669 $ 2,270 $ 3,355 (1) Represents the amount of silent partnership contributions that our subsidiaries are required to repurchase from the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG and is exclusive of the guaranteed rate of return. See “Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements,” below. (2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations on our outstanding debt obligations, excluding capital lease obligations, including the guaranteed rate of return on the unaffiliated partners’ silent partnership contributions, which is based on our assumptions regarding wafer output. (3) Includes principal and imputed interest. (4) We have unconditional purchase commitments for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase commitments in the table above. Also, purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. 71 Table of Contents 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 On August 14, 2007, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012. The 5.75% Notes bear interest at 5.75% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2008 until the maturity date of August 15, 2012. The terms of the 5.75% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 5.75% Indenture), dated as of August 14, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. The 5.75% Notes will be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 5.75% Notes, into shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 49.6771 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.75% Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $20.13 per share. This initial conversion price represents a premium of 50% relative to the last reported sale price of our common stock on August 8, 2007 (the trading date preceding the date of pricing of the 5.75% Notes) of $13.42 per share. This initial conversion rate will be adjusted for certain anti-dilution events. In addition, the conversion rate will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) of AMD under certain circumstances. Holders of the 5.75% Notes may require us to repurchase the 5.75% Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) or a termination of trading (as defined in the Indenture). Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 5.75% Notes. The 5.75% Notes rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated debt. The 5.75% Notes rank junior in right of payment to all our existing and future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of our subsidiaries. In connection with the issuance and sale of the 5.75% Notes, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the 5.75% Registration Rights Agreement), dated August 14, 2007, between us and Lehman Brothers Inc. (the initial purchaser), pursuant to which we agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the resale by holders of the 5.75% Notes and the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 5.75% Notes, use our reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective and keep the registration statement effective for the period described in the 5.75% Registration Rights Agreement. On November 7, 2007, we filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically declared effective. We will file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the shelf registration statement, prepare and file a supplement to the prospectus, or file a new shelf registration statement on a quarterly basis in order to include any additional selling security holders in the shelf registration statement. We could be subject to paying additional interest on the 5.75% Notes for the period during which a default under the 5.75% Registration Rights Agreement exists. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting discounts, commissions and offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $1.5 billion. We used all of the net proceeds, together with available cash, to repay in full the remaining outstanding balance of the October 2006 Term Loan. All security interests under the October 2006 Term Loan were released. In connection with this repayment, we recorded a charge of approximately $17 million to write off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the October 2006 Term Loan. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 5.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 72 Table of Contents 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 On April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015. The 6.00% Notes bear interest at 6.00% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015. The terms of the 6.00% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 6.00% Indenture), dated April 27, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. Upon the occurrence of certain events described in the 6.00% Indenture, the 6.00% Notes will be convertible into cash up to the principal amount, and if applicable, into shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes (the 6.00% Conversion Shares) in respect of any conversion value above the principal amount, based on an initial conversion rate of 35.6125 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 6.00% Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $28.08 per share. This initial conversion price represents a premium of 100% relative to the last reported sale price of our common stock on April 23, 2007 (the trading date preceding the date of pricing of the 6.00% Notes) of $14.04 per share. The conversion rate will be adjusted for certain anti-dilution events. In addition, the conversion rate will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture) under certain circumstances. Holders of the 6.00% Notes may require us to repurchase the 6.00% Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or a termination of trading (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture). Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 6.00% Notes. The 6.00% Notes rank equally with our existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of our future subordinated debt. The 6.00% Notes rank junior to all of our existing and future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of our subsidiaries. In connection with the issuance and sale of the 6.00% Notes, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the 6.00% Registration Rights Agreement), dated April 27, 2007, between us and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as representative of the several initial purchasers of the 6.00% Notes, pursuant to which we agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the resale by holders of the 6.00% Notes and the 6.00% Conversion Shares, use our reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective and keep the registration statement effective for the period described in the 6.00% Registration Rights Agreement. On July 13, 2007 we filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically declared effective. We will file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the shelf registration statement, prepare and file a supplement to the prospectus, or file a new shelf registration statement on a quarterly basis in order to include any additional selling security holders in the shelf registration statement. We could be subject to paying additional interest on the 6.00% Notes for the period during which a default under the 6.00% Registration Rights Agreement exists. In connection with the issuance of the 6.00% Notes, on April 24, 2007, we purchased the capped call. The capped call has an initial strike price of $28.08 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which matches the initial conversion price of the 6.00% Notes, and a cap price of $42.12 per share. The capped call is intended to reduce the potential common stock dilution to then existing stockholders upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes because the call option allows us to receive shares of common stock from the counterparty generally equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes. We do not anticipate experiencing an increase in the number of shares outstanding from the conversion of the 6.00% Notes unless the price of our common stock appreciates above $42.12 per share. If, however, the market value per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call, exceeds the cap price of the capped call, there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of the common stock exceeds the cap price. We analyzed the capped call under EITF Issue No. 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled In, a Company’s Own Stock, and determined that it meets the criteria for classification as an 73 Table of Contents equity transaction. As a result, we have recorded the purchase of the capped call as a reduction in additional paid-in capital and will not recognize subsequent changes in its fair value. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting discounts, commissions and offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $2.2 billion. We used approximately $182 million of the net proceeds to purchase the capped call and applied $500 million of the net proceeds to prepay a portion of the amount outstanding under the October 2006 Term Loan. In connection with this repayment, we recorded a charge of approximately five million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the October 2006 Term Loan repayment. In September 2007, the FASB exposed for comment a proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. APB 14-a, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (including partial cash settlement). This proposed FSP would change the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments, including our 6.00% Notes. Under the proposed new rules, for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The effect of the proposed new rules for our 6.00% Notes is that the equity component would be included in the paid-in-capital portion of stockholders’ equity on our balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 6.00% Notes. Higher interest expense would result by recognizing accretion of the discounted carrying value of the 6.00% Notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of the 6.00% Notes. If issued as proposed, the final FSP would provide final guidance effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, would not permit early application, and would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. In November 2007, the FASB announced it is expected to begin its redeliberations of the proposed FSP in January 2008. Therefore, it is highly unlikely the proposed effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 will be retained. We cannot predict the exact accounting treatment that will be imposed (which may differ from the foregoing description) or when any change will be finally implemented. However, if the final FSP is issued as exposed, we expect to have higher interest expense starting in the period of adoption due to the interest expense accretion and, if the retrospective application provisions of the proposed FSP are retained in the final FSP, our prior period interest expense associated with the 6.00% Notes would be higher than previously reported due to retrospective application. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 6.00% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements Our 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36, is located in Dresden, Germany at our wafer fabrication site. Fab 36 is owned by AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG (or AMD Fab 36 KG), a German limited partnership. We control the management of AMD Fab 36 KG through a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 LLC, which is a general partner of AMD Fab 36 KG. AMD Fab 36 KG is our indirect consolidated subsidiary. To date, we have provided a significant portion of the financing for Fab 36. In addition to our financing, Leipziger Messe GmbH, a nominee of the State of Saxony, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH, an investment consortium arranged by M+W Zander Facility Engineering GmbH, the general contractor for the project, and a consortium of banks have provided financing for the project. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are limited partners in AMD Fab 36 KG. We have also received grants and allowances from federal and state German authorities for the Fab 36 project. 74 Table of Contents The funding to construct and facilitize Fab 36 consists of: • equity contributions from us of $860 million under the partnership agreements, revolving loans from us of up to approximately $1.1 billion, and guarantees from us for amounts owed by AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliates to the lenders and unaffiliated partners; • investments of approximately $471 million from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs; • loans of approximately $893 million from a consortium of banks, which were fully drawn as of December 2006; • up to approximately $798 million of subsidies consisting of grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG, of which $541 million of cash has been received as of December 29, 2007; • up to approximately $386 million of subsidies consisting of grants and allowances, from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, depending on the level of capital investments in connection with expansion of production capacity at our Dresden site, of which $17 million of cash has been received as of December 29, 2007; and • a loan guarantee from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders referenced above after foreclosure on all other security. As of December 29, 2007, we contributed to AMD Fab 36 KG the full amount of equity required under the partnership agreements and no loans from us were outstanding. These equity amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. On April 21, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG entered into a 700 million euro Term Loan Facility Agreement among AMD Fab 36 KG, as borrower, and a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, as lenders, dated April 21, 2004 (Fab 36 Term Loan) and other related agreements (collectively, the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate Fab 36. The consortium of banks agreed to make available up to $893 million in loans to AMD Fab 36 KG upon its achievement of specified milestones, including attainment of “technical completion” at Fab 36, which required certification by the banks’ technical advisor that AMD Fab 36 KG had a wafer fabrication process suitable for high-volume production of advanced microprocessors and had achieved specified levels of average wafer starts per week and average wafer yields, as well as cumulative capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. On October 13, 2006, we executed an Amendment Agreement dated as of October 10, 2006, which amended the terms of the Fab 36 Term Loan. Under the amended and restated Fab 36 Term Loan, AMD Fab 36 KG has the option to borrow in U.S. dollars as long as our group consolidated cash (which is defined as the sum of our unsecured cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments less the aggregate amount outstanding under any revolving credit facility) is at least $500 million. Moreover, to protect the lenders from currency risks, if our consolidated cash is below one billion or our credit rating drops below B3 by Moody’s and B- by Standard & Poor’s, AMD Fab 36 KG will be required to maintain a cash reserve account with deposits equal to 5 percent of the amount of U.S. dollar loans outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan and to make balancing payments into this account equal to the difference between (x) the total amount of U.S. dollar loans outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan and (y) the U.S dollar equivalent of 700 million euros (as reduced by repayments, prepayments, cancellations, and any outstanding loans denominated in euros. In October 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG borrowed $645 million under the Fab 36 Term Loan (the First Installment). In December 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG borrowed $248 million under the Fab 36 Term Loan (the Second Installment). As of December 29, 2007, AMD Fab 36 KG had borrowed the full amount available under the Fab 36 Term Loan and the total amount outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan was $839 million. AMD Fab 36 KG may select an interest period of one, two, or three months or any other period agreed between AMD Fab 36 KG and the lenders. The rate of interest on each installment for the interest period selected is the 75 Table of Contents percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin, plus LIBOR plus minimum reserve cost if any. As of December 29, 2007, the rate of interest for the initial interest period was 7.09875 percent for the First Installment and 6.7175 percent for the Second Installment. This loan is repayable in quarterly installments, which commenced in September 2007 and terminates in March 2011. An aggregate of $54 million has been repaid as of December 29, 2007. The amended and restated Fab 36 Term Loan also sets forth certain covenants applicable to AMD Fab 36 KG. For example, for as long as group consolidated cash is at least one billion, our credit rating is at least B3 by Moody’s and B- by Standard & Poor’s, and no event of default has occurred, the only financial covenant that AMD Fab 36 KG is required to comply with is a loan to fixed asset value covenant. Specifically, the loan to fixed asset value (as defined in the agreement) as at the end of any relevant period specified in Column A below cannot exceed the percentage set out opposite such relevant period in Column B below: Column A Column B (Relevant Period) (Maximum Percentage of Loanto Fixed Asset Value) up to and including 31 December 2008 50 percent up to and including 31 December 2009 45 percent thereafter 40 percent As of December 29, 2007, AMD Fab 36 KG was in compliance with this covenant. If group consolidated cash is less than one billion or our credit rating is below B3 by Moody’s and B- by Standard & Poor’s, AMD Fab 36 KG will also be required to maintain minimum cash balances equal to the lesser of 100 million euros and 50 percent of the total outstanding amount under the Fab 36 Term Loan. AMD Fab 36 KG may elect to maintain the minimum cash balances in an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars if group consolidated cash is at least $500 million. If on any scheduled repayment date, our credit rating is Caa2 or lower by Moody’s or CCC or lower by Standard & Poor’s, AMD Fab 36 must increase the minimum cash balances by five percent of the total outstanding amount, and at each subsequent request of Dresdner Bank, by a further five percent of the total outstanding amount until such time as either the credit rating increases to at least Ba3 by Moody’s and BB- by Standard & Poor’s or the minimum cash balances are equal to the total outstanding amounts. Our credit rating was B1 with Moody’s and B with Standard and Poor’s as of December 29, 2007. AMD Fab 36 KG pledged substantially all of its current and future assets as security under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, we pledged our equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding pledged its equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Admin and its partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG and AMD Fab 36 Admin and AMD Fab 36 LLC pledged all of their partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG. We guaranteed the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. We also guaranteed repayment of grants and allowances by AMD Fab 36 KG, should such repayment be required pursuant to the terms of the subsidies provided by the federal and state German authorities. Pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee Agreement among us, as guarantor, AMD Fab 36 KG, Dresdner Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG, Niederlassung Luxemburg, we have to comply with specified adjusted tangible net worth and EBITDA financial covenants if the sum of our group consolidated cash declines below the following amounts: Amount (in millions) if Moody’s Rating is at least if Standard & Poor’s Rating is at least $500 B1 or lower and B+ or lower 425 Ba3 and BB- 400 Ba2 and BB 350 Ba1 and BB+ 300 Baa3 or better and BBB-or better 76 Table of Contents As of December 29, 2007, group consolidated cash was greater than $500 million and, therefore, the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. If our group consolidated cash declines below the amounts set forth above, we would be required to maintain adjusted tangible net worth, determined as of the last day of each preceding fiscal quarter, of not less than the amounts set forth below: Measurement Date on fiscal quarter ending Amount(In millions) December 2005 $ 1,500 March 2006 and on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter $ 1,750 In addition, if our group consolidated cash declines below the amounts set forth above, we would be required to maintain EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) as of the last day of each preceding fiscal period set forth below in an amount not less than the amount set forth below opposite the date of such preceding fiscal period: Period Amount (In millions) For the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending December 2005 and for the four fiscal quarters ending on each fiscal quarter thereafter $850 and $750 on an annualized basis for the two most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to December 31, 2006 Also on April 21, 2004, AMD, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD that owns substantially all of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, and AMD Fab 36 Admin GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD Fab 36 Holding that owns the remainder of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, (collectively referred to as the AMD companies) entered into a series of agreements (the partnership agreements) with the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, relating to the rights and obligations with respect to their limited partner and silent partner contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG. The partnership was established for an indefinite period of time. A partner may terminate its participation in the partnership by giving twelve months advance notice to the other partners. The termination becomes effective at the end of the year following the year during which the notice is given. However, other than for good cause, a partner’s termination will not be effective before December 31, 2015. The partnership agreements set forth each limited partner’s aggregate capital contribution to AMD Fab 36 KG and the milestones for such contributions. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, AMD, through AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, agreed to provide an aggregate of $860 million, Leipziger Messe agreed to provide an aggregate of $294 million and Fab 36 Beteiligungs agreed to provide an aggregate of $176 million. The capital contributions of Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are comprised of limited partnership contributions and silent partnership contributions. These contributions were due at various dates upon the achievement of milestones relating to the construction and operation of Fab 36. As of December 29, 2007, all capital contributions were made in full. The partnership agreements also specify that the unaffiliated limited partners will receive a guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent per annum on their total investment depending upon the monthly wafer output of Fab 36. We guaranteed these payments by AMD Fab 36 KG. In April 2005, we amended the partnership agreements in order to restructure the proportion of Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership and limited partnership contributions. Although the total aggregate amount that Leipziger Messe has agreed to provide remained unchanged, the portion of its contribution that constitutes limited partnership interests was reduced by $74 million while the portion of its contribution that constitutes 77 Table of Contents silent partnership interests was increased by a corresponding amount. In this report, we refer to this additional silent partnership contribution as the New Silent Partnership Amount. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements and subject to the prior consent of the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin have a call option over the limited partnership interests held by Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, first exercisable three and one-half years after the relevant partner has completed the applicable capital contribution and every three years thereafter. Also, commencing five years after completion of the relevant partner’s capital contribution, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs each have the right to sell their limited partnership interest to third parties (other than competitors), subject to a right of first refusal held by AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, or to put their limited partnership interest to AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The put option is thereafter exercisable every three years. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs also have a put option in the event they are outvoted at AMD Fab 36 KG partners’ meetings with respect to certain specified matters such as increases in the partners’ capital contributions beyond those required by the partnership agreements, investments significantly in excess of the business plan, or certain dispositions of the limited partnership interests of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The purchase price under the put option is the partner’s capital account balance plus accumulated or accrued profits due to such limited partner. The purchase price under the call option is the same amount, plus a premium of five million to Leipziger Messe and a premium of three million to Fab 36 Beteiligungs. The right of first refusal price is the lower of the put option price or the price offered by the third party that triggered the right. We guaranteed the payments under the put options. In addition, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are obligated to repurchase the silent partnership interest of Leipziger Messe’s and Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ contributions over time. This mandatory repurchase obligation does not apply to the New Silent Partnership Amount. Specifically, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin were required to repurchase Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership interest of $118 million in annual 25 percent installments commencing in December 2006, and Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ silent partnership interest of $88 million in annual 20 percent installments commencing in October 2005. As of December 29, 2007, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin repurchased $53 million of Fab 36 Beteiligungs’ silent partnership contributions and $59 million of Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership contribution. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we initially classified the portion of the silent partnership contribution that is mandatorily redeemable as debt on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value at the time of issuance because of the mandatory redemption features described in the preceding paragraph. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this debt towards its ultimate redemption value of the silent partnership contributions by the guaranteed annual rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We record this periodic accretion to redemption value as interest expense. The limited partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 KG received from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs and the New Silent Partnership Portion described above are not mandatorily redeemable, but rather are subject to redemption outside of the control of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. In consolidation, we initially record these contributions as minority interest, based on their fair value. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this minority interest toward its ultimate redemption value of these contributions by the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We classify this periodic accretion of redemption value as minority interest. No separate accounting is required for the put and call options because they are not freestanding instruments and not considered derivatives under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. As of December 29, 2007, AMD Fab 36 KG had received $206 million of silent partnership contributions and $265 million of limited partnership contributions, which includes a New Silent Partnership Amount of $74 million, from the unaffiliated partners. These contributions were recorded as debt and minority interest, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. 78 Table of Contents In addition to support from us and the consortium of banks referenced above, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony have agreed to support the Fab 36 project in the form of: • a loan guarantee equal to 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders after foreclosure on all other security; and • subsidies consisting of grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $798 million, depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG and $386 million, depending on the level of capital investments for expansion of production capacity at our Dresden site. In connection with the receipt of investment grants for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2008 and is required to maintain this headcount through December 2013. We record these grants as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2013. Initially, we amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, we started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, starting from the first quarter of 2006, we amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the investments because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy documents could result in the repayment of all or a portion of the amounts received to date. As of December 29, 2007, AMD Fab 36 KG received cash allowances of $320 million for capital investments made in 2003 through 2006 as well as cash grants of $221 million for capital investments made in 2003 through 2007 and a prepayment for capital investments planned for the first half of 2008. The Fab 36 Loan Agreements also require that we: • provide funding to AMD Fab 36 KG if cash shortfalls occur, including funding shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any defaults caused by AMD Fab 36 KG or its affiliates; and • guarantee 100 percent of AMD Fab 36 KG’s obligations under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements until the loans are repaid in full. Under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are generally prevented from paying dividends or making other payments to us. In addition, AMD Fab 36 KG would be in default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements if we or any of the AMD companies fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if, after the occurrence of the event, the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is adversely affected. Circumstances that could result in a default include: • our failure to provide loans to AMD Fab 36 KG as required under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • failure to pay any amount due under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements within five days of the due date; • occurrence of any event which the lenders reasonably believe has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets or condition of AMD Fab 36 KG or AMD or their ability to perform under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Fab 36 KG or any limited partner; • occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) of AMD; • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on payment of profits, dividends or other distributions except in limited circumstances and restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, disposing of assets and repaying subordinated debt; and 79 Table of Contents • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain financial covenants, including loan to fixed asset value ratio and, in certain circumstances, a minimum cash covenant. In general, any default with respect to other indebtedness of AMD or AMD Fab 36 KG that is not cured, would result in a cross-default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. The occurrence of a default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan. In addition, the occurrence of a default under this agreement could result in a cross-default under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes, 6.00% Notes, and 5.75% Notes. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 On October 29, 2004, we issued $600 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On April 22, 2005, we exchanged these notes for publicly registered notes which have substantially identical terms as the old notes except that the publicly registered notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and, therefore, do not contain legends restricting their transfer. The 7.75% Notes mature on November 1, 2012. Interest on the 7.75% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, beginning May 1, 2005. Prior to November 1, 2008, we may redeem some or all of the 7.75% Notes at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a “make-whole” premium, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.75% Notes. Thereafter, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on November 1, 2008 through October 31, 2009 103.875 percent Beginning on November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010 101.938 percent Beginning on November 1, 2010 through October 31, 2011 100.000 percent On November 1, 2011 100.000 percent Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 7.75% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.75% Notes at a repurchase price of 101 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the 7.75% Notes contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, which include all of our subsidiaries, from: • incurring additional indebtedness except specified permitted debt; • paying dividends and making other restricted payments; • making certain investments if an event of default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; • creating or permitting certain liens; • creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • using the proceeds from sales of assets; • entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidating, merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. 80 Table of Contents In February 2006, we redeemed 35 percent (or $210 million) of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 7.75% Notes. The holders of the 7.75% Notes received 107.75 percent of the principal amount of the 7.75% Notes plus accrued interest. In connection with this redemption, we recorded a charge of approximately $16 million, which represents the 7.75% redemption premium, and a charge of four million, which represents 35 percent of the unamortized issuance costs incurred in connection with the original issuance of the 7.75% Notes. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remaining principal outstanding under our 7.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other Long-Term Liabilities in the Contractual Obligations table above includes $105 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2010 and $26 million related to employee benefit obligations. Other Long-Term Liabilities excludes amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 29, 2007, primarily consisted of $401 million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the Fab 30 and Fab 36 projects and a $17 million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California in 1998. Other Long Term Liabilities in the Contractual Obligations table above also excludes $51 million of non-current uncertain tax benefits under FIN 48, which are included in the caption, “Other Long Term Liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2007. Included in the non-current uncertain tax benefits is a potential cash payment of approximately $35 million that could be payable by us upon settlement with a taxing authority. We have not included this amount in the Contractual Obligations table above as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of any settlement with the respective taxing authority, if any. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 29, 2007, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $234 million. Included in this amount is $213 million in obligations under certain energy supply contracts which AMD entered into with local energy suppliers to provide our Dresden, Germany wafer fabrication facilities with utilities (gas, electricity, heating and cooling) to meet the energy demands for our manufacturing requirements. We account for certain fixed payments due under these energy supply arrangements as capital leases pursuant to EITF Issue No. 01-8, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease and FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases. The capital lease obligations under the energy supply arrangements are payable in monthly installments through 2020. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2021. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Our total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 29, 2007, were $343 million, of which $50 million is accrued as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We will make these payments through 2011. Unconditional Purchase Commitments Total non-cancelable purchase commitments as of December 29, 2007, were $2.3 billion for periods through 2020. These purchase commitments include $975 million related to contractual obligations of Fab 30 and Fab 36 81 Table of Contents to purchase energy and gas and approximately $400 million representing future payments to IBM for the period from December 30, 2007 through 2011 pursuant to our joint development agreement. As IBM’s services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, we expense the payments as incurred. The remaining purchase commitments also include non-cancelable contractual obligations to purchase raw materials, natural resources and office supplies. In connection with the acquisition of ATI, we made several commitments to the Minister of Industry under the Investment Canada Act, including that we will: increase spending on research and development in Canada to a specified amount over the course of a three-year period when compared to ATI’s expenditures in this area in prior years; maintain Canadian employee headcount at specified levels by the end of the three-year anniversary of the acquisition; increase by a specified amount the number of our Canadian employees focusing on research and development; attain specified Canadian capital expenditures over a three-year period; maintain a presence in Canada through a variety of commercial activities for a period of five years; and nominate a Canadian for election to our Board of Directors over the next five years. Our minimum required Canadian capital expenditures and research and development commitments are included in our aggregate unconditional purchase commitments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees of Indebtedness Recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 29, 2007 related to underlying liabilities that are already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2007 and their expected expiration dates by year. No incremental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for these guarantees. AmountsGuaranteed 2008 2009 (In millions) Repurchase obligations to Fab 36 partners(1) $ 94 $ 47 $ 47 Payment guarantees on behalf of consolidated subsidiaries(2) 54 54 — Total guarantees $ 148 $ 101 $ 47 (1) This amount represents the amount of silent partnership contributions that we are required to repurchase from the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG and is exclusive of the guaranteed rate of return of an aggregate of approximately $112 million. (2) This amount represents the payment obligation due to a supplier arising out of the purchase of equipment by our consolidated subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 KG. We guaranteed these payment obligations on behalf of our subsidiary. At December 29, 2007, approximately $24 million was outstanding under this guarantee and recorded as a payable on our consolidated balance sheet. The obligation under the guarantee diminishes as AMD Fab 36 KG pays its supplier. Guarantees of Indebtedness Not Recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co. KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by AMD, Infineon Technologies AG (Infineon) and DuPont Photomasks, Inc. (Dupont) for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. We procure advanced photomasks from AMTC and use them in manufacturing our microprocessors. In April 2005, DuPont was acquired by Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Toppan, named Toppan Photomasks, Inc. In December 2007, Infineon entered into an assignment agreement to transfer its interest in AMTC and BAC to Qimonda AG, with the exception of certain AMTC/BAC related payment guarantees. The assignment became effective in January 2008. 82 Table of Contents In December 2002, BAC obtained a $110 million term loan to finance the construction of the photomask facility. At the same time, AMTC and BAC, as lessor, entered into a lease agreement. The term of the lease agreement is ten years, which coincides with the repayment by BAC of the $110 million term loan. Each joint venture partner guaranteed a specific percentage of AMTC’s rental payments. Pursuant to an agreement between AMTC, BAC and DuPont (now Toppan), AMTC may exercise a “step-in” right, in which it would assume Toppan’s remaining rental payments in connection with the rental agreement between Toppan and BAC. As of December 29, 2007, our guarantee of AMTC’s portion of the rental obligation was approximately $11 million, and our maximum liability in the event AMTC exercises its “step-in” right and the other joint venture partners default under the guarantee was approximately $102 million. These estimates are based upon forecasted rents to be charged in the future and are subject to change based upon the actual usage of the facility by the tenants and foreign currency exchange rates. In December 2002, AMTC obtained a $176 million revolving credit facility to finance its operations. In December 2007, AMTC entered into a new $141 million revolving credit facility, of which $96 million was outstanding as of December 29, 2007. The proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the existing $176 million revolving credit facility and to provide additional financing for the acquisition of new tools. Subject to certain conditions under the revolving credit facility, AMTC may request that the loan amount be increased by an additional $59 million. The term of the revolving credit facility is three years. Upon request by AMTC and subject to certain conditions, the term of the revolving credit facility may be extended by two additional one year periods. Pursuant to a guarantee agreement, each joint venture partner guaranteed one third of AMTC’s outstanding loan balance under the revolving credit facility. As of December 29, 2007, our liability under this guarantee was $32 million plus our portion of accrued interest and expenses. Under the terms of the guarantee, if our group consolidated cash (which is defined as cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities less the aggregate amount outstanding under any revolving credit facility) is less than or expected to be less than $500 million, we will be required to provide cash collateral equal to one third of the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We evaluated our guarantee under the provisions of FIN 45 and concluded it was immaterial to our financial position or results of operations. Outlook Our outlook disclosure is based on current expectations and contains forward-looking statements. Reference should be made to “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of Part I, Item 1—Business. For a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in the following disclosure, see the “Risk Factors” section in this report and such other risks and uncertainties as set forth in this report or detailed in our other Securities and Exchange Commission reports and filings. In the first quarter of 2008, we expect revenue to decrease in line with seasonality. We also expect during the first quarter that: operating expenses will increase by approximately five percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2007; acquisition-related charges will be approximately $55 million; income tax expense will be approximately $15 million; and depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $315 million. We also expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion for 2008, of which we expect to incur $425 million in the first quarter of 2008. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but clarifies the fair value definition, establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop assumptions used for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 clarifies that the fair value is the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to 83 Table of Contents unobservable data, for example, the reporting entity’s own data. It emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement and a fair value measurement should therefore be based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. SFAS 157 expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition, including the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of such measurements on earnings for the period. In its February 6, 2008 meeting, the FASB decided to (i) partially defer the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (ii) remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS 157. The partial deferral is applicable to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. Companies will still need to apply SFAS 157’s recognition and disclosure requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities or for nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually. The FASB also decided to amend SFAS 157 to exclude SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases, and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions. The exclusion does not apply to fair value measurements of assets and liabilities recorded as a result of a lease transaction but measured pursuant to other pronouncements within the scope of SFAS 157. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted SFAS 157 at the beginning of our fiscal year 2008 on December 30, 2007. There has been no material impact to our financial statements due to the adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). This statement allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities as well as certain nonfinancial instruments that are similar to financial instruments (collectively, eligible items) at fair value (the fair value option). The election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, the statement specifies that all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument shall be reported in earnings. The statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Upon initial adoption, this statement provides entities with a one-time chance to elect the fair value option for the eligible items. The effect of the first measurement to fair value should be reported as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year the statement is adopted. We adopted SFAS 159 at the beginning of our fiscal year 2008 on December 30, 2007 and did not make any elections for fair value accounting. Therefore, we did not record a cumulative-effect adjustment to our opening retained earnings balance. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). This statement retains the fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the acquisition method of accounting, or purchase method, be used for all business combinations. SFAS 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, SFAS 141R requires, among other things, expensing of acquisition-related and restructuring-related costs, measurement of pre-acquisition contingencies at fair value, measurement of equity securities issued for purchase at the date of close of the transaction and capitalization of in-process research and development, all of which represent modifications to current accounting for business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Adoption is prospective and early adoption is not permitted. Adoption of SFAS 141R will not impact our accounting for business combinations closed prior to its adoption, but given the nature of the changes noted above, we expect our accounting for business combinations occurring subsequent to adoption will be significantly different than that applied following current accounting literature. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the 84 Table of Contents noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. This Statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 160 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007 as required. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was reported as a reduction of the beginning balance of retained earnings of six million and a decrease to goodwill of three million. As of the date of adoption, our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $149 million, of which $28 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The recognition of the remaining unrecognized tax benefits would be reported as an adjustment to goodwill to the extent of pre-acquisition unrecognized tax benefits or would be offset by a change in valuation allowance. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. We accrued interest and penalties of $21 million and $38 million, respectively, as of the date of adoption of FIN 48. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, tax years 1994 – 2006 remain subject to examination in the U.S., 1999 – 2006 in Canada and 1999 – 2006 in various foreign jurisdictions. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 29, 2007, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were highly liquid investments and consisted primarily of bank notes, short-term corporate notes, money market auction rate preferred stocks and short-term federal agency notes. In April 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Notes. The 6.00% Notes bear interest at 6.00% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015 unless the 6.00% Notes are repurchased or converted prior to the maturity date. We used $500 million of the net proceeds to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our October 2006 Term Loan. As a result of this partial repayment, the margin on the interest rate for the October 2006 Term Loan was reduced from 2.25 percent to 2.00 percent. Of the remaining net proceeds, approximately $1.5 billion was invested in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms and $182 million was used to purchase a capped call associated with the sale and issuance of our 6.00% Notes. In August 2007, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Notes. The 5.75% Notes bear interest at 5.75% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2008 until the maturity date of August 15, 2012 unless the 5.75% Notes are repurchased or 85 Table of Contents converted prior to the maturity date. We used all of the net proceeds, together with available cash, to repay in full the outstanding balance of the October 2006 Term Loan. With the full repayment of the October 2006 Term Loan, we replaced a substantial amount of our floating interest rate debt with fixed interest rate debt. Accordingly, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows has decreased. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. At this point in time, we believe the current credit market difficulties do not have a material impact on our financial position. However, a future degradation in credit market conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. With the exception of the October 2006 Term Loan, which was used to fund a portion of the ATI acquisition, we generally use proceeds from borrowings primarily for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital needs. The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 29, 2007: Fiscal2008 Fiscal2009 Fiscal2010 Fiscal2011 Fiscal2011 Thereafter Total Fiscal 2007Fair Value (In millions except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 986 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 986 $ 986 Weighted-average rate 5.03 % — — — — — 5.03 % 5.03 % Variable rate amounts $ 312 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 312 $ 312 Weighted-average rate 4.83 % — — — — — 4.83 % 4.83 % Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts $ 132 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 132 $ 132 Weighted-average rate 5.11 % — — — — — 5.11 % 5.11 % Variable rate amounts $ 269 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 269 $ 269 Weighted-average rate 6.44 % — — — — — 6.44 % 6.44 % Long-term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 12 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 12 $ 12 Weighted-average rate 4.77 % — — — — — 4.77 % 4.77 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,711 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,711 $ 1,711 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ 49 $ 49 $ 2 $ 2 $ 1,891 $ 2,203 $ 4,196 $ 3,240 Weighted-average rate 12.83 % 12.82 % 6.86 % 6.86 % 6.16 % 6.00 % 6.23 % 6.30 % Variable rate amounts $ 179 $ 268 $ 303 $ 89 $ — $ — $ 839 $ 839 Weighted-average rate 7.10 % 7.10 % 7.11 % 7.11 % — — 7.10 % 7.10 % Total Debt Obligations $ 228 $ 317 $ 305 $ 91 $ 1,891 $ 2,203 $ 5,035 $ 4,079 86 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk. As of December 29, 2007, as a result of our foreign operations, we had costs, assets and liabilities that were denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro and Canadian dollar. For example, some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of ATI in October 2006, some of our expenses and debt are denominated in Canadian dollars. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 29, 2007 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. In particular, generally we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll, equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 29, 2007 and December 31, 2006. All of our foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts mature within 12 months.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 27, 2008 and related notes thereto, which are included in this Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In the second quarter of 2008, we decided to divest our Handheld and Digital Television business units, which were previously part of our former Consumer Electronics segment. As a result, we classified them as discontinued operations in our financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that, based on ongoing negotiations related to the divestiture of the Handheld business unit, the discontinued operations classification criteria for this business unit were no longer met. As a result we classified the results of the Handheld business unit back into continuing operations. The following discussion is limited to our continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. Introduction We are a global semiconductor company with facilities around the world. We design, develop and offer primarily: • x86 microprocessors, for the commercial and consumer markets, embedded microprocessors for commercial, commercial client and consumer markets and chipsets for desktop and notebook PCs, professional workstations and servers; and • graphics, video and multimedia products for desktop and notebook PCs, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers, and technology for game consoles. In the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of continuing operations for AMD and its consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2008 compared to 2007 and 2007 compared to 2006, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. Our results of continuing operations include sales of graphics and chipset products from the effective date of the ATI acquisition on October 25, 2006 through December 27, 2008 in the following reportable segments: (i) Computing Solutions, which includes Chipsets and (ii) Graphics. We are not able to provide any comparative information for the Graphics segment prior to the ATI acquisition, since we did not previously participate in this market. Overview The credit market crisis and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the global economy resulted in a number of challenges for AMD in 2008. In particular, due to the credit markets and the reduced leverage in the economy, both business and consumer spending decreased, including with respect to end-user products that incorporate our products. In particular, during the fourth quarter of 2008, which is typically our strongest quarter during the fiscal year, end user demand for PCs and servers decreased significantly. In turn, our customers sharply reduced orders for our products in order to balance their inventory levels to address end-customer demand. We believe this inventory correction trend will continue across the supply chain into at least the first half of 2009, particularly in connection with notebook PCs. AMD net revenue for 2008 was $5.8 billion, a decrease of 1 percent compared to 2007 net revenue of $5.86 billion. Net revenue in 2008 included $191 million of process technology license revenue related to the sale of 200 millimeter equipment. Excluding this process technology license revenue, 2008 net revenue would have 47 Table of Contents declined 4 percent compared to 2007 due to lower average selling prices and unit volumes for our Computing Solutions segment. Although 2008 net revenue was approximately flat compared to 2007, net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 35 percent compared to the third quarter of 2008 and 33 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding the $191 million process technology license revenue from the third quarter of 2008, net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 would have decreased 28 percent from the third quarter of 2008. The decline was primarily due to the global economic environment, which significantly affected demand during the fourth quarter of 2008. Although the fourth quarter results for our Graphics segment were not immune to the impact of the global economic recession, with net revenue for our Graphics segment declining by 30 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2008, net revenue for the Graphics segment increased by 17 percent compared to 2007. The increase in Graphics net revenue was primarily due to the successful introduction of ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of GPU products and a 76 percent increase in royalties received in connection with the sale of game console systems. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2008 was 40 percent, a 3 percent increase compared to 37 percent in 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2008 we experienced a large incremental write-down of inventory due to a weak economic outlook. This $227 million incremental inventory write-down negatively impacted gross margin in 2008 by 4 percentage points. Gross margin in 2008 was favorably impacted by 2 percentage points as a result of the process technology license revenue referenced above. Without the impact of the incremental write-down of inventory and the technology license revenue, 2008 gross margin would have increased 5 percentage points compared to 2007 primarily due to an improvement in fab utilization and reductions in manufacturing costs. Our operating loss for 2008 was $2 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 2007. The reduction in the operating loss was primarily due to a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment, which is included in the caption “Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations, and the $191 million of process technology license revenue referenced above. Without the impact of the above mentioned gain on tool sales and process technology license revenue, our 2008 operating loss would have been flat compared to 2007. In light of the current economic environment, one of our key priorities is to preserve cash. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 27, 2008 were $1.1 billion compared to $1.9 billion at December 29, 2007. This decline in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to our significant losses. To that end, during 2008 we undertook, and plan to continue to undertake, a number of actions to decrease our expenses. For 2008 our capital expenditures decreased to $621 million compared to $1.7 billion in 2007. Moreover, in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008 we implemented restructuring plans to reduce our expenses. The plans primarily involve the termination of employees, contract or program terminations and facility site consolidations and closures. In January 2009 we announced additional headcount reductions, primarily focused on our back-end manufacturing and sales, marketing, and general and administrative functions, and cost reduction activities including temporary salary reductions for employees in the United States and Canada and suspension of certain employee benefits. We also plan to reduce our manufacturing output in order to control our inventory levels. Moreover, in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in January 2009, we divested our Digital Television business unit and certain assets related to our Handheld business unit, respectively. The aggregate cash consideration for these divestures was over $200 million, and the divestitures will allow us to focus on our core strategy of computing and graphics market opportunities. In addition, in October 2008 we entered into a Master Transaction Agreement with ATIC and WCH to form a manufacturing joint venture, The Foundry Company. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, we anticipate certain benefits to our business, including, on a consolidated basis, the infusion of approximately $2.2 billion of cash, of which approximately $800 million will be available for current working capital purposes and $1.4 billion will go to The Foundry Company to fund its operations, including capital expenditures and repayment of approximately $1.1 billion (as of December 27, 2008) of indebtedness, which we will transfer to The Foundry Company upon 48 Table of Contents consummation of the transactions. The Foundry Company will record $1 billion of the $1.4 billion as debt from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to ATIC and $400 million as equity from the issuance of securities to ATIC. Because we will consolidate the accounts of The Foundry Company after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, our consolidated balance sheet will present the $1.1 billion (as of December 27, 2008) of transferred indebtedness and the $1 billion of debt related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes as debt and the $400 million as non-controlling interest. However, The Foundry Company will have the obligation to repay the transferred indebtedness and the Convertible Notes. Also, future wafer manufacturing capital expenditures will be the responsibility of The Foundry Company, and after the consummation of the transactions, we will have the option but not the obligation to provide future funding to The Foundry Company. ATIC has committed to provide additional equity funding to The Foundry Company of at least $3.6 billion and up to $6.0 billion over the five years after the closing of the transaction. In 2008 we also made progress towards improving our competitive position across both of our businesses. In November 2008 we launched our first 45-nanometer quad-core AMD Opteron processors, and we expect the transition to 45-nanometer process technology to be completed at Fab 36 by mid-2009. In 2008 and early 2009, we also introduced several new platform products such as our “Puma” and “Yukon” platforms for notebooks and our “Dragon” platform for desktop PCs. With respect to graphics products, we released the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of products in June 2008. Despite the cost cutting efforts referenced above, one of our key priorities for 2009 is to continue to invest in research and development and to maintain the competitiveness of our product roadmap. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Proposed Manufacturing Joint Venture On October 6, 2008 we entered into a Master Transaction Agreement, which was further amended on December 5, 2008, with ATIC to form a manufacturing joint venture, The Foundry Company. We intend to contribute certain manufacturing-related assets and liabilities to The Foundry Company in exchange for securities of The Foundry Company consisting of one Class A Ordinary Share, Class A Preferred Shares and Class B Preferred Shares, and ATIC intends to contribute cash to The Foundry Company and pay cash to us in exchange for securities of The Foundry Company consisting of one Class A Ordinary Share, Class A Preferred Shares, Class B Preferred Shares and the Convertible Notes. Although ATIC’s Convertible Notes will not be convertible immediately upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, on an as converted to ordinary shares basis, we will own 34.2 percent of The Foundry Company and have a 50 percent voting interest in The Foundry Company while ATIC will own 65.8 percent of The Foundry Company and have a 50 percent voting interest in The Foundry Company. Pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, we intend to issue to WCH 58 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 35 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 58,000,000 multiplied by the lesser of (i) the average of the closing prices of our common stock on the NYSE for the 20 trading days immediately prior to and including December 12, 2008 or (ii) the average of the closing prices of our common stock on the NYSE for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the closing date of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement. The warrants will be exercisable after the earlier of (i) public ground-breaking of a proposed Foundry Company manufacturing facility in up-state New York and (ii) 24 months from the date of issuance, and the warrants will have a ten year term. 49 Table of Contents For accounting purposes, we will consolidate the accounts of The Foundry Company as required by FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, An Interpretation of ARB No. 51. (FIN 46R). Based on the structure of the transaction, pursuant to the guidance in FIN 46R, The Foundry Company is a variable-interest entity, and we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and are, therefore, required to consolidate the accounts of The Foundry Company. Upon the closing of the transaction, the accounts of The Foundry Company will include (i) the assets and liabilities contributed by us to The Foundry Company, recorded at their historical costs, in exchange for certain securities of The Foundry Company and (ii) the cash contributed by ATIC to The Foundry Company in exchange for certain securities of The Foundry Company. Upon consolidation, intercompany transactions and profits will be eliminated. Pursuant to the requirements of FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—An Amendment of ARB No. 51, which we will be required to apply as of the beginning of fiscal 2009, ATIC’s non-controlling interest, represented by its equity interests in The Foundry Company, will be presented outside of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet due to the right that ATIC has to put those securities back to us in the event of a change of control of AMD during the two years following the closing of the transactions. Our net income (loss) per common share will consist of its consolidated net income (loss), as adjusted for (i) the portion of The Foundry Company’s earnings or losses attributable to ATIC, which will be based on ATIC’s proportional ownership interest in The Foundry Company’s Class A Preferred Shares, and (ii) the non-cash accretion of Class B Preferred Shares attributable to us, based on our proportional ownership interest of The Foundry Company’s Class A Preferred Shares. Under the Master Transaction Agreement, the cash consideration that WCH and ATIC will pay and the securities that they will receive are as follows: • Cash to be paid by WCH to us for the purchase of 58 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 35 million shares of our common stock: estimated to be $124 million, assuming a $2.15 per share price (which was the average of the closing prices per share of our common stock on the NYSE during the 20 trading days immediately prior to and including December 12, 2008); • Cash to be paid by ATIC to The Foundry Company for 4% Class A Convertible Subordinated Notes of The Foundry Company, convertible into 201,810 Class A Preferred Shares: $202 million; • Cash to be paid by ATIC to The Foundry Company for 11% Class B Convertible Subordinated Notes of The Foundry Company, convertible into 807,240 Class B Preferred Shares: $807 million; • Cash to be paid by ATIC to The Foundry Company for 218,190 Class A Preferred Shares of The Foundry Company: $218 million; • Cash to be paid by ATIC for 872,760 Class B Preferred Shares of The Foundry Company: $873 million, which includes $700 million paid to us for 700,000 Class B Preferred Shares of The Foundry Company. The Class B Preferred Shares are, by their terms, deemed to accrete in value at a rate of 12% per year, compounded semiannually. This accreted value will be taken into account upon certain distributions to the holders or upon conversion of the Class B Preferred Shares. Upon closing of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD and ATIC will hold 1,090,950, or 83.3%, and 218,190, or 16.7%, respectively, of The Foundry Company Class A Preferred Shares and ATIC will own 100% of the Class B Preferred Shares and the Convertible Notes. Beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 2009, we will have a separate reportable segment for The Foundry Company in our financial statement disclosures. ATI Acquisition On October 25, 2006, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of ATI Technologies, a publicly held company headquartered in Markham, Ontario, Canada (the Acquisition) for a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. ATI was engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of innovative 50 Table of Contents 3D graphics and digital media silicon solutions. We believe that the Acquisition allows us to deliver products that better fulfill the increasing demand for more integrated computing solutions. We included the operations of ATI in our consolidated financial statements beginning on October 25, 2006. The aggregate consideration we paid for all outstanding ATI common shares consisted of approximately $4.3 billion of cash and 58 million shares of our common stock. In addition, we also issued options to purchase approximately 17.1 million shares of our common stock and approximately 2.2 million comparable AMD restricted stock units in exchange for outstanding ATI stock options and restricted stock units. The vested portion of these options and restricted stock units was valued at approximately $144 million. The unvested portion, valued at approximately $69 million, continues to be amortized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting periods of the assumed options. To finance a portion of the cash consideration paid, we borrowed $2.5 billion pursuant to a Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc. dated October 24, 2006 (October 2006 Term Loan). We repaid the October 2006 Term Loan in 2007. The total purchase price for ATI was $5.6 billion, including acquisition-related costs of $25 million. Purchase Price Allocation The total purchase price was allocated to ATI’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of October 24, 2006 as set forth below: (In millions) Cash and marketable securities $ 500 Accounts receivable 290 Inventories 431 Goodwill 3,217 Developed product technology 752 Game console royalty agreement 147 Customer relationships 257 Trademarks and trade names 62 Customer backlog 36 In-process research and development 416 Property, plant and equipment 143 Other assets 25 Accounts payable and other liabilities (631 ) Reserves for exit costs (8 ) Debt and capital lease obligations (31 ) Deferred revenues (2 ) Total purchase price $ 5,604 Management performed an analysis to determine the fair value of each tangible and identifiable intangible asset, including the portion of the purchase price attributable to acquired in-process research and development projects. In-Process Research and Development Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Projects that qualified as IPR&D represented those that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. These projects included development of next generation products for the Graphics segment and Chipsets business unit and the former Consumer Electronics segment. The estimated fair value of the projects for the Graphics segment and Chipsets business unit was approximately $193 million ($122 million for graphics products and $71 million for chipset products). The estimated fair value of the projects for the former Consumer 51 Table of Contents Electronics segment was approximately $223 million. Starting in the first quarter of 2007, in conjunction with the integration of ATI’s operations, we began reporting operations related to its chipset products in our Computing Solutions segment. The value assigned to IPR&D was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, specifically an excess earnings approach, which estimates value based upon the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the in-process projects, net of all contributory asset returns. The approach includes consideration of the importance of each project to the overall development plan and estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by ATI and its competitors. The discount rates applied to individual projects were selected after consideration of the overall estimated weighted average cost of capital for ATI and the discount rates applied to the valuation of the other assets acquired. Such weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market acceptance and penetration, market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets. In developing the estimated fair values, we used discount rates ranging from 14 percent to 15 percent. Other Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets Developed product technology consisted of products that had reached technological feasibility and included technology in ATI’s discrete GPU products, integrated chipset products, handheld products, and digital TV products divisions. We initially expected the developed technology to have an average useful life of five years. However, as a result of the 2007 and 2008 impairment analysis discussed below, we shortened the estimated useful life of certain of these developed technology intangible assets to reflect their remaining useful lives. As of December 27, 2008, the developed product technology intangible assets had an estimated average remaining useful life of 12 months. Game console royalty agreements represent agreements existing as of October 24, 2006 with video game console manufacturers for the payment of royalties to ATI for intellectual property design work performed and are estimated to have an average useful life of five years. Customer relationship intangibles represent ATI’s customer relationships existing as of October 24, 2006 and were estimated to have an average useful life of four years. As a result of the 2007 and 2008 impairment analysis discussed below, we shortened the estimated useful life of certain of these customer relationship intangible assets to reflect their remaining useful lives. As of December 27, 2008, the customer relationship intangible assets had an estimated average remaining useful life of 21 months. Trademarks and trade names had an estimated average useful life of seven years. As a result of the 2007 and 2008 impairment analysis discussed below, we have shortened the estimated useful life of certain of these trademarks and trade names intangible assets to reflect their remaining useful lives. As of December 27, 2008, the trademark and trade names intangible assets had an estimated average remaining useful life of 45 months. Customer backlog represents customer orders existing as of October 24, 2006 that had not been delivered and were estimated to have a useful life of 14 months. As of December 27, 2008, all of these customer backlog intangible assets have been fully amortized. We determined the fair value of other acquisition-related intangible assets using income approaches based on the most current financial forecast available as of October 24, 2006. The discount rates we used to discount net cash flows to their present values ranged from 12 percent to 15 percent. We determined these discount rates 52 Table of Contents after consideration of our estimated weighted average cost of capital and the estimated internal rate of return specific to the acquisition. We based estimated useful lives for the other acquisition-related intangible assets on historical experience with technology life cycles, product roadmaps and our intended future use of the intangible assets. We are amortizing the acquisition-related intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Integration Concurrent with the acquisition, we implemented an integration plan which included the termination of some ATI employees, the relocation or transfer to other sites of other ATI employees and the closure of duplicate facilities. The costs associated with employee severance and relocation totaled approximately $7 million. The costs associated with the closure of duplicate facilities totaled approximately $1 million. These costs were included as a component of net assets acquired. Additionally, the integration plan also included termination of some AMD employees, cancellation of some existing contractual obligations, and other costs to integrate the operations of the two companies. We incurred costs of approximately $1 million, $28 million and $32 million for the years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, and they are included in the caption, “Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges,” on our consolidated statements of operations. 2007 Impairment In the fourth quarter of 2007, pursuant to our accounting policy, we performed an annual impairment test of goodwill. As a result of this analysis, we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill included in our Graphics and former Consumer Electronics segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.26 billion, of which $913 million is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” and $346 million is included in the caption “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in our 2007 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting units within these segments as of October 1, 2007, with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. While market valuation data for comparable companies was gathered and analyzed, we concluded that there was not sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach, and therefore we ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 13 percent to 15 percent. The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from an updated long-term financial forecast, which was developed as part of our strategic planning cycle conducted annually during the latter part of the third quarter of 2007. The decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and resulting impairment charge was primarily driven by the updated long-term financial forecasts, which showed lower estimated near-term and longer-term profitability compared to estimates developed at the time of the completion of the ATI acquisition. The updated financial forecast for our Graphics segment was lower primarily because of intense pricing competition with our primary competitor throughout 2007, which required an increase in sales and marketing activities to a greater extent than we previously forecasted. In addition, we had invested in the development of new graphics technologies to a greater extent than previously forecasted, which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses. Also, Intel announced its intention to develop a discrete graphics product. These factors resulted in lower near-term and longer-term forecasts of Graphics business revenues, operating profitability and cash flows compared to the forecasts at the time of the ATI acquisition. 53 Table of Contents The updated financial forecast for our former Consumer Electronics segment was lower primarily because our Digital Television business was affected by the rapid introduction and proliferation of low cost digital televisions that did not contain our technology. The availability and adoption of these low cost alternatives by consumers resulted in lower forecasted sales to those companies employing our technology. In addition, our Handheld business was dependant on a small number of mobile handset customers for its revenues. During 2007, one handset customer experienced severe competition and eroding market share for its consumer handset products. These two principal factors resulted in lower near-term and longer-term forecasts of revenues, operating profitability, and cash flows compared to our forecast at the time of the ATI acquisition. These updated long-term financial forecasts represented the best estimate that we had at the time, and we believe that the underlying assumptions were reasonable at that time. The outcome of our 2007 goodwill impairment analysis indicated that the carrying amount of certain acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. We assessed the recoverability of the acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups, as appropriate, by determining whether the unamortized balances could be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows. We determined that certain of the acquisition related developed product technology associated with our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments was impaired primarily due to the revised lower revenue forecasts associated with the products incorporating such developed product technology. We measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were based on projected discounted future net cash flows. As a result of this impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $349 million, of which $219 million is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” and $130 million is included in the caption “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in our 2007 consolidated statement of operations. 2008 Impairment In the second quarter of 2008, we evaluated the viability of our non-core businesses and determined that our Handheld and Digital Television business units were not directly aligned with our core strategy of computing and graphics market opportunities. Therefore, we decided to divest these units and classify them as discontinued operations in our financial statements. As a result, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill associated with our Handheld and Digital Television business units were impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge of $799 million, of which $336 million related to the Handheld business unit is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” and $463 million related to the Digital Television business unit is included in the caption, “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charges were determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting units with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. We chose the same approach that we used during the 2007 impairment analysis, which required estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 18 percent to 32 percent. The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from an updated long-term financial forecast, which was revised as a result of the challenging economic environment. The decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and resulting impairment charge was primarily driven by the estimated proceeds from the expected divestiture of these business units. The outcome of our goodwill impairment analysis indicated that the carrying amount of certain of our Handheld and Digital Television business unit acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups may not have been recoverable. We determined that the carrying amounts of certain acquisition-related intangible assets associated with our Handheld and Digital Television business units exceeded their estimated fair values, and we recorded an impairment charge of $77 million, of which $67 million related to the Handheld business unit is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” and $10 million related to the 54 Table of Contents Digital Television unit is included in the caption, “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that, based on our ongoing negotiations related to the divestiture of the Handheld business unit, the discontinued operations classification criteria for this business unit were no longer met. As a result we classified the results of the Handheld business back into continuing operations. During the first quarter of 2009 we sold certain graphics and multimedia technology assets and intellectual property that were formerly part of our Handheld business unit to Qualcomm. As of December 27, 2008, these assets were classified as assets held for sale and included in the caption, “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” in our 2008 consolidated balance sheet. Pursuant to our agreement with Qualcomm, we retained the AMD Imageon media processor brand and the right to continue selling the products that were part of the Handheld business unit, and we intend to support our existing Handheld products and customers through the current product lifecycles. We do not intend to develop any new Handheld products or engage new customer programs beyond those already committed. The lives of the remaining certain intangible assets associated with the Handheld business unit have been shortened to reflect our current expectations of their economic usefulness. In the fourth quarter of 2008, pursuant to our accounting policy, we conducted an annual impairment test of goodwill. In addition, due to the significant decline in the price of our common stock and the revised lower revenue forecast for the fourth quarter of 2008, which we concluded were additional impairment indicators, we conducted another interim impairment analysis as of November 22, 2008, the end of our second fiscal month of the fourth quarter. As a result of these analyses, we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill included in the Graphics and Computing Solutions segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of $622 million, which is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting units within these segments as of November 22, 2008 with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. Also, we chose the same approach that we used during the 2007 impairment analysis, which required estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 19 percent to 25 percent. The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from an updated long-term financial outlook in light of fourth quarter market conditions and the challenging economic outlook. The conclusion was also due to the deterioration in the price of our common stock and the resulting reduced market capitalization. Our cost basis of goodwill deductible for tax was $2.6 billion. Our adjusted basis after tax deductions through 2008 is $2.2 billion. The outcome of our 2008 goodwill impairment analysis indicated that the carrying amount of certain acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. We assessed the recoverability of the acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups, as appropriate, by determining whether the unamortized balances could be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows. We determined that certain of the acquisition-related intangible assets associated with our Computing Solutions and Graphics segments and our Handheld business unit were impaired primarily due to the revised lower revenue forecasts associated with the products incorporating the developed product technology, the customer relationships, and the trademarks and trade names. We measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were based on projected discounted future net cash flows. As a result of this impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $62 million, which is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. If business conditions continue to deteriorate we may have to perform additional interim goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, which could result in additional impairment charges. 55 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenues, inventories, asset impairments, goodwill, business combinations, use of fair value measurements and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near-term factory production planning. Generally, inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand for the next six months are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Business Combinations. In accordance with business combination accounting, we have allocated the purchase price of ATI to related tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to acquisition-related intangible assets. We review the acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recovered. We made estimates of fair value of the ATI assets acquired and liabilities assumed using reasonable assumptions based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the acquisition-related intangible assets included but were not limited to: future expected cash flows from the sale of products, expected costs to develop in-process research and development projects into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the market’s awareness of the acquired company’s brand and the acquired company’s market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the 56 Table of Contents combined company’s product portfolio and discount rates. Unanticipated events may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results as evidenced by the impairment charges we recorded in 2007 and 2008 with respect to goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the ATI acquisition. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. All of our goodwill at December 27, 2008 is related to our acquisition of ATI. In accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present. We perform the annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. Implied fair value of goodwill is determined by considering both the income and market approach. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates. We recorded a portion of the impairment charges in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” in our consolidated statement of operations and a portion as discontinued operations. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units included projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13 percent to 32 percent which were based on our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the risks associated with the operations. A variance in the discount rate could have had a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill, which totaled $323 million at December 27, 2008. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets including Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets. We consider quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we test for recoverability of the asset by determining whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. Significant judgment is involved in estimating future cash flows and deriving the discount rate ranging from 18 percent to 30 percent to apply to the estimated future cash flows and in evaluating the results of appraisals or other valuation methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results which also reduces the carrying basis of the related asset. The new carrying value of the related asset is depreciated or amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We also must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful life of the asset. We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. As a result of our impairment analysis, in 2008 we recorded impairment charges of $130 million in continuing operations and $10 million in discontinued operations. In 2007, we recorded definite lived intangible asset impairment charges of $349 million. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. 57 Table of Contents We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. Fair Value Measurements. Effective December 30, 2007, we adopted FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. The fair values of our financial instruments reflect the estimates of amounts that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The fair value estimates presented in our consolidated financial statements are based on information available to us as of December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007. In accordance with SFAS 157, we apply a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value. The three levels are the following: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are primarily classified within Level 1 or Level 2, with the exception of auction rate securities (ARS). This is because cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued primarily using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs, as provided to us by our brokers. ARS investments are classified within Level 3 because they are valued using a discounted cash flow model. Some of the inputs to this model are unobservable in the market and are significant. Our foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 because the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments in active markets. The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our ARS investments and auctions for these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. In light of these developments, to determine the fair value for our ARS, we obtained broker reports and discussed with brokers the critical inputs that they used in their proprietary models to assess fair value, which included liquidity, credit rating and discounted cash flows associated with these ARS. In addition, we performed our own discounted cash flow analysis. 58 Table of Contents The significant inputs and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our ARS, as of December 27, 2008, are as follows: • The discount rate was determined based on the average one-month LIBOR (2.34%) during the fourth quarter of 2008, adjusted by 240 basis points (bps) to reflect the current market conditions for instruments with similar credit quality at the date of valuation. In addition, the discount rate was adjusted for a liquidity discount of 90 bps to reflect the market risk for these investments that has arisen due to the lack of an active market. • We assigned an additional credit risk discount of 200 bps to the discount rate for all ARS that are not backed by the federal government. The total carrying value as of December 27, 2008 of investments not backed by the federal government was approximately $32 million. We applied the discount rate over the expected life of 17 years of the estimated cash flows of the ARS. The projected interest income is based on the future contractual rates set forth in the individual prospectus for each of the ARS. Results of Operations We review and assess operating performance using segment net revenues and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. and other, income taxes and minority interest. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. From December 26, 2005 through October 24, 2006, we had two reportable segments: • the Computation Products segment, which included microprocessors, AMD chipsets and related revenue; and • the Embedded Products segment, which included embedded processors and related revenue. As a result of the acquisition of ATI, effective October 25, 2006, we had the following four reportable segments through December 31, 2006: • the Computation Products segment, which included microprocessors, AMD chipsets and related revenue; • the Embedded Products segment, which included embedded processors and related revenue; • the Graphics and Chipsets segment, which included graphics, video and multimedia products and chipsets sold by ATI prior to the acquisition and related revenue; and • the Consumer Electronics segment, which included products used in handheld devices, digital televisions and other consumer electronics products as well as related revenue and revenue for royalties received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporated our technology. From the first quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2008, in conjunction with the integration of ATI’s operations into ours, we began reviewing and addressing operating performance using the following three reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which included what was formerly the Computation Products segment and the Embedded Products segment, as well as revenue from sales of ATI chipsets; • the Graphics segment, which included graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue; and • the Consumer Electronics segment, which included products used in handheld devices, digital televisions and other consumer electronics products, as well as revenue from royalties received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. 59 Table of Contents In the second quarter of 2008, we decided to divest our Handheld and Digital Television business units, which were previously part of the Consumer Electronics segment. As a result, we classified these business units as discontinued operations in our financial statements and began reviewing and assessing operating performance using the following reportable operating segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which includes microprocessors, chipsets and embedded processors and related revenue; and • the Graphics segment, which includes graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue as well as revenue from royalties received in connection with the sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. In addition to the reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments because we do not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the operating segments. Such expenses include employee stock-based compensation expense, profit sharing expense, restructuring, ATI acquisition-related and integration charges and charges for goodwill and intangible asset impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that, based on ongoing negotiations related to the divestiture of the Handheld business unit, the discontinued operations classification criteria for this business unit were no longer met. As a result we classified the results of the Handheld business unit back into continuing operations. The results of the Handheld business unit are reported in the All Other category. Also, this category included the sale of Personal Internet Communicator (PIC) products for the first three quarters of 2006, after which, the manufacturing of PIC products ceased. We use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year. Prior to December 31, 2006, our fiscal year ended on the last Sunday in December. Commencing in 2007, our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 each included 52 weeks, and the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of 53 weeks. References in this report to 2008, 2007 and 2006 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. The following is a summary of our net revenue and operating income (loss), by segment, from continuing operations, for 2008, 2007 and 2006. This segment information has been reclassified to conform to the reportable segment structure adopted in the fourth quarter of 2008. 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Computing Solutions Net revenue $ 4,559 $ 4,702 $ 5,367 Operating income (loss) (461 ) (712 ) 679 Graphics Net revenue 1,165 992 189 Operating income (loss) 12 (39 ) (6 ) All Other Net revenue 84 164 71 Operating income (loss) (1,506 ) (1,559 ) (690 ) Total Net revenue 5,808 5,858 5,627 Operating income (loss) $ (1,955 ) $ (2,310 ) $ (17 ) 60 Table of Contents Computing Solutions Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2008 decreased by $143 million or 3 percent compared to net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2007. Net revenue in 2008 included $191 million of process technology license revenue recognized in connection with the licensing of certain manufacturing process technology to a third party. See “Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment and the license of related process technology” below, for additional information. Without the effect of the process technology license revenue, Computing Solutions net revenue would have decreased by $334 million or 7 percent compared to 2007 due to a 4 percent decrease in average selling prices and a 3 percent decrease in unit shipments of our Computing Solutions products. The decrease in average selling prices was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices for both our microprocessors and chipset products. Although our microprocessor product mix improved, average selling prices for our microprocessors decreased due to competitive market conditions. Average selling prices for our chipsets decreased due to competitive pricing pressure and an unfavorable shift in our product mix towards older generation chipsets. Unit shipments decreased due to decreased shipments of our microprocessors as a result of significantly lower end-user demand in the fourth quarter of 2008, which resulted in our customers reducing or cancelling orders for our products in order to bring their inventory levels into balance to address end-user demand and the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2007 decreased by $665 million or 12 percent compared to net revenue of $5.4 billion in 2006 despite the inclusion of revenue from the sale of ATI chipsets for the full year in 2007 as compared to only nine weeks in 2006. Net revenue decreased as a result of a 32 percent decrease in average selling prices of products included in our Computing Solutions segment, partially offset by a 30 percent increase in unit shipments. The decrease in average selling prices was primarily caused by a decrease in the average selling prices of our microprocessor products. Microprocessor average selling prices decreased due to both competitive market conditions and a higher concentration of sales of processors for desktop and notebook PCs in 2007, which generally carry lower average selling prices than our processors for servers. In particular, our competitor first offered quad-core multi-chip module processors for servers and desktop PCs in November 2006, and these products were available throughout 2007. We first introduced our quad-core products for servers in August 2007 and for desktop PCs in November 2007. However, we did not achieve significant volume shipments of these products in 2007, and sales of these products did not significantly contribute to 2007 revenue. In light of the timing of our quad-core product introductions and their lack of broad availability during 2007, we discounted the selling price of certain competing processor products. Unit shipments increased primarily due to the inclusion of ATI chipset sales, which accounted for 76 percent of the increase, and increased customer demand for our microprocessors for notebook PCs, which accounted for 24 percent of the increase. However, we did achieve record unit shipments in 2007 with respect to our microprocessor products. Computing Solutions operating loss was $461 million in 2008 compared to an operating loss of $712 million in 2007. The reduction in operating loss was due to the recognition of the $191 million of process technology license revenue referenced above, a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment that did not occur in 2007, a $168 million decrease in cost of sales, a $97 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses partially offset by a $63 million increase in research and development expenses. See Part II, Item 7—MD&A—“Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment and the license of related process technology” below, for additional information. Cost of sales decreased due to lower microprocessor unit volume and manufacturing cost reductions in 2008. The lower costs were partially offset by a $214 million incremental write-down of inventory related to Computing Solutions products in the fourth quarter of 2008. Research and development expenses increased and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Computing Solutions operating loss was $712 million in 2007 compared to operating income of $679 million in 2006. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the $665 million decrease in revenue described above, a $307 million increase in manufacturing expenses, a $329 million increase in research and development expenses and a $91 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth 61 Table of Contents under “Expenses,” below. Manufacturing expenses increased primarily due to increased unit volumes of microprocessors, a shift to higher-end microprocessors and the inclusion of ATI’s chipset business in the Computing Solutions segment for a full year in 2007, as opposed to only nine weeks in 2006. Graphics Graphics net revenue of $1.2 billion in 2008 increased by $173 million or 17 percent compared to 2007 revenue of $992 million. The increase was primarily due to a 12 percent increase in revenue from sales of GPU products and a 76 percent increase in royalty revenue from the sales of game consoles that incorporate our graphics technology. Revenue from the sales of GPU products increased due to an increase in unit shipments of GPUs while GPU average selling prices were approximately flat. GPU unit shipments increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to demand for new products, including the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of products which we introduced in June 2008. Although unit shipments increased in 2008 compared to 2007, we saw a significant decline in unit shipments in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the weak macroeconomic environment and resulting decrease in demand. Royalty revenue increased due to increased demand for the latest generation of game consoles. Graphics operating income in 2008 was $12 million compared to an operating loss of $39 million in 2007. The $51 million operating improvement was due to the increase in revenue referenced above. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $77 million increase in cost of sales because of higher unit shipments and increased research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses, which increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. Graphics net revenue and operating loss in 2007 were $992 million and $39 million, respectively. Graphics net revenue and operating loss for the period of October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006 were $189 million and $6 million, respectively. The increases in revenue and operating losses were due to the inclusion of the operations attributable to the Graphics segment for the full year in 2007 compared to only nine weeks in 2006. Graphics net revenue in the second half of 2007 increased 35 percent over the first half of 2007 due to the successful introduction of new products and the seasonal increase in royalties on game consoles. From the first half of 2007 to the second half of 2007 unit shipments increased by 19 percent and average selling prices increased by 9 percent. The improvement in net revenue was the primary driver that significantly narrowed the operating loss from the first half of 2007 to the second half of 2007. We did not sell comparable products prior to the ATI acquisition. All Other All Other net revenue of $84 million in 2008 decreased by $80 million or 49 percent compared to net revenue of $164 million in 2007. All Other net revenue is from sales of products included in our Handheld business unit. All Other net revenue of $164 million in 2007 increased by $93 million or 131 percent compared to 2006 revenue of $71 million. All Other net revenue reflects sales of products included in our Handheld business unit for the full year of 2007 compared to only nine weeks of 2006. All Other net revenue in 2006 also includes the impact of customer returns of previously sold Personal Internet Communicatory (PIC) products. Effective as of the third quarter of 2006, we ceased production of PIC products. All Other operating loss of $1.5 billion in 2008 decreased by $53 million compared to an operating loss of $1.6 billion in 2007. The decrease in the operating loss was primarily attributable to a $124 million decrease in ATI acquisition-related charges and a $43 million decrease in impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets, partially offset by $90 million in restructuring charges and $23 million of expenses in connection with the formation of The Foundry Company manufacturing joint venture incurred in 2008. ATI acquisition-related charges decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a decrease in amortization expense of acquired intangible 62 Table of Contents assets of $72 million, a decrease in the write down of acquisition-related intangible assets in 2008, a decrease of $27 million in integration charges, and the absence of a $28 million charge related to the cost of fair value adjustment of acquired inventory. All Other operating loss of $1.6 billion in 2007 increased $869 million compared to an operating loss of $690 million in 2006. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related impairment charges of $1.1 billion, which included a goodwill write-down of $913 million and a write-down of acquired intangible assets of $219 million and an increase of $173 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in ATI acquisition-related charges of $448 million. Acquisition-related charges in 2006 included a $416 million charge for acquired in-process research and development, which did not recur in 2007. See “ATI Acquisition” above, for additional information. Comparison of Gross Margin, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net, Income Taxes and Other Expenses The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2008, 2007 and 2006. 2008 2007 2006 (In millions except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 3,488 $ 3,669 $ 2,833 Gross margin 2,320 2,189 2,794 Gross margin percentage 40 % 37 % 50 % Research and development $ 1,848 $ 1,771 $ 1,190 Marketing, general and administrative 1,304 1,360 1,138 In-process research and development — — 416 Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges 137 236 67 Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 1,089 1,132 — Restructuring 90 — — Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment (193 ) — — Interest income 39 73 116 Interest expense (366 ) (367 ) (126 ) Other income (expense), net 22 (7 ) (13 ) Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries (33 ) (35 ) (28 ) Equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. and other (53 ) (155 ) (45 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 68 27 23 Gross Margin Gross margin as a percent of net revenue increased to 40 percent in 2008 compared to 37 percent in 2007. However, gross margin in 2008 was impacted by the following two events: the $191 million process technology license revenue recorded in our Computing Solutions segment favorably impacted gross margin in 2008 by 2 percentage points while the $227 million incremental write-down of inventory negatively impacted gross margin in 2008 by 4 percentage points. Without the effect of the incremental write-down of inventory and the process technology license revenue, gross margin would have been 42 percent in 2008 compared to 37 percent in 2007. This improvement in gross margin, was primarily due to an improvement in fab utilization and reductions in manufacturing costs. Gross margin in 2008 was also favorably impacted by 1 percentage point due to the 76% increase in royalty revenue received in 2008 compared to 2007 in connection with the sale of game consoles that incorporate our graphics technology. Although we experienced a richer product mix in 2008 compared to 2007, competitive pricing pressures mitigated any significant benefits to gross margin. Gross margin as a percent of net revenue decreased to 37 percent in 2007 compared to 50 percent in 2006 primarily due to significantly lower average selling prices for our microprocessor products in 2007 compared to 63 Table of Contents 2006. Gross margin percentage in the first half of 2007 was also negatively impacted by higher manufacturing unit costs for our microprocessor products due to a shift in our product mix to higher-end microprocessors and increased depreciation expenses associated with the expansion of Fab 36. However, manufacturing efficiencies, improved inventory management, and a richer product mix in the second half of 2007 offset the unfavorable impact in the first half of 2007. On an annual basis, the inclusion of ATI’s lower margin operations in our consolidated operations adversely impacted our gross margins by approximately two percentage points. We record grants and allowances that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for our Dresden facilities as long-term liabilities on our consolidated financial statements. We amortize these amounts as they are earned as a reduction to operating expenses. We record the amortization of the production related grants and allowances as a credit to cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $86 million in 2008, $138 million in 2007 and $116 million in 2006. The fluctuations in the recognition of these credits have not significantly impacted our gross margins. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased $77 million, or 4 percent, from $1.8 billion in 2007 to $1.9 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a $63 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to the Computing Solutions segment and a $9 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment. Research and development expenses for the Computing Solutions segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs for our next generation microprocessor products and start-up costs for Fab 38. Research and development expenses for the Graphics segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs. Research and development expenses increased $581 million, or 49 percent, from $1.2 billion in 2006 to $1.8 billion in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to: a $329 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $189 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment increased due primarily to higher product engineering and design costs for our next generation microprocessor products. In addition, research and development expenses attributable to ATI’s chipset business were included for the full year in 2007 compared to only nine weeks in 2006. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment increased primarily due to the inclusion of operations related to this segment for the full year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. From time to time, we also apply for subsidies relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development subsidies are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $36 million in 2008, $30 million in 2007 and $27 million in 2006. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased $56 million, or 4 percent, from $1.4 billion in 2007 to $1.3 billion in 2008. This decrease was primarily due to a $97 million decrease in corporate marketing and branding expenses for our Computing Solutions segment and a $25 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, which decreased for the reasons set forth under “Stock-Based Compensation Expense,” below. These decreases were partially offset by a $33 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses for the Graphics segment and $23 million of expenses in connection with the formation of The Foundry Company manufacturing joint venture. Graphics’ marketing, general and administrative expenses increased due to higher marketing and cooperative advertising costs related to the launch of new products. 64 Table of Contents Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $222 million, or 20 percent, from $1.1 billion in 2006 to $1.4 billion in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to: a $112 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, a $91 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and an $11 million increase in severance charges for workforce reductions. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment increased primarily due to the inclusion of the operations related to this segment for the full year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment increased due to expansion of marketing programs for our microprocessor products, increased legal expenses and additional investments in information technology, partially offset by a $9 million reduction in bonus expense. In-process research and development, amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges, and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges decreased $99 million, or 42 percent, from $236 million in 2007 to $137 million in 2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $27 million decrease in charges related to the integration of AMD and ATI operations and a $72 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets due to the write-down of certain acquired intangible assets as a result of the impairment analyses. See Part II, Item 7 “MD&A—ATI Acquisition” above, for additional information. Impairment charges of goodwill and acquired intangible assets decreased by $43 million, or 4 percent, from $1.1 billion in 2007 to $1.1 billion in 2008. In-process research and development charges of $416 million in 2006 related to projects acquired in connection with the acquisition of ATI. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges increased $169 million, or 252 percent, from $67 million in 2006 to $236 million in 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to a $173 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in charges related to the integration of AMD and ATI operations. Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased primarily due to the inclusion of charges for the full year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. See Part II, Item 7 “MD&A—ATI Acquisition” above, for additional information. Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment and the license of related process technology During 2008, in conjunction with the conversion of Fab 30 from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter fabrication, we sold certain 200 millimeter manufacturing equipment and licensed certain process technology to a third party. We evaluated this multiple-element arrangement in accordance with EITF No. 00-21, and determined that each component was considered a separate unit of accounting. In addition, the arrangement consideration was allocated to each unit based on their relative fair values. In the second quarter of 2008, upon delivery of a majority of the manufacturing equipment to the applicable third party, we recognized a gain of approximately $167 million, which is classified in the caption “Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. The difference between the $167 million gain recognized in the transaction described above and the $193 million gain shown in the consolidated statement of operations for 2008 represents gains recognized on sales of 200 millimeter equipment to other third parties. In addition, we have deferred recognizing approximately $49 million of payments received pending the future delivery of the remaining manufacturing equipment, which is classified under the caption “Other current liabilities” in our 2008 consolidated balance sheet. In the third quarter of 2008, upon delivery of the process technology, we recognized revenue of approximately $191 million, which is included under the caption “Net revenue” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. 65 Table of Contents Effects of Restructuring Plans In the second and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008 we implemented restructuring plans to reduce our cost structure. The plans primarily involve the termination of employees. In addition, the restructuring plan implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 involves additional cost reduction actions that either have taken place during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 or will take place in 2009. The restructuring charges for the restructuring plan implemented during the second fiscal quarter of 2008 represent primarily severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits and the costs related to the termination of a contract. The restructuring charges for the restructuring plan implemented during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 represent primarily severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, contract or program termination costs, asset impairments and exit costs for facility site consolidations and closures. The second quarter 2008 restructuring plan was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2008. The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring plan is expected to be substantially completed during 2009. For 2008 these restructuring charges were $90 million. Of the $90 million, approximately $28 million will result in cash expenditures in 2009. These charges have been aggregated and appear on the line item entitled “Restructuring charges” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. In December 2002, we initiated a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to further align the cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry-wide excess inventory. The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at the Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities that we currently occupy under long-term operating leases through 2011. At December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, we had approximately $32 million and $50 million respectively of 2002 restructuring related accruals recorded which will continue to be paid through 2011. In January 2009 we announced additional headcount reductions primarily focused on manufacturing and sales, marketing, and general and administrative functions and cost reduction activities including temporary salary reductions for employees in the United States and Canada and suspension of certain benefits such as our 401(k) plan matching program. These additional cost reduction actions will result in additional charges in the first and second quarters of 2009. Interest Income Interest income of $39 million in 2008 decreased from $73 million in 2007, primarily due to a 39 percent decrease in weighted-average interest rates and lower average cash balances during 2008 compared to 2007. Interest income of $73 million in 2007 decreased from $116 million in 2006, primarily due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances in 2007 compared to 2006, partially offset by a 7 percent increase in weighted-average interest rates in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest Expense 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Total interest charges $ 375 $ 390 $ 136 Less: interest capitalized (9 ) (23 ) (10 ) Interest expense $ 366 $ 367 $ 126 Total interest charges of $375 million in 2008 decreased by $15 million from $390 million in 2007 primarily due to a lower outstanding aggregate debt balance in 2008 compared to 2007. During 2008, we repaid $134 million of the principal amount outstanding under our Fab 36 Term Loan and repurchased $63 million of 66 Table of Contents silent partnership contributions (which we classify as debt) from the unaffiliated partners of AMD Fab 36 KG. In addition, we did not incur any interest on the October 2006 Term Loan in 2008 whereas in 2007 we incurred interest through August 2007. These factors were partially offset by the increased interest incurred on our 6.00% Notes and 5.75% Notes, which were outstanding for all of 2008 but only for a portion of 2007. Capitalized interest expense of $9 million in 2008 decreased by $14 million from $23 million in 2007. Capitalized interest expense decreased by an aggregate of $17 million from 2007 to 2008 because we discontinued capitalizing interest for Fab 36 in the first quarter of 2008 when it was in full production and we discontinued capitalizing interest for our campus in Austin, Texas in the fourth quarter of 2007 upon completion of construction. This was partially offset by a $3 million increase in capitalized interest expense related to the conversion of our Fab 38 facility in Dresden, Germany. Total interest charges of $390 million in 2007 increased by $254 million from $136 million in 2006 primarily due to an additional $128 million interest expense incurred on our 6.00% Notes and 5.75% Notes, which we issued in 2007. In addition, we incurred $117 million higher interest expense on our Fab 36 Term Loan and October 2006 Term Loan because these facilities were outstanding for all of 2007 but only for a portion of 2006. Capitalized interest expense of $23 million in 2007 increased by $13 million from $10 million in 2006 because we incurred higher capitalized interest expenses for Fab 36 and we were capitalizing interest in connection with our campus in Austin, Texas through the fourth quarter of 2007. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB No. 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). This FSP requires issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The effective date of this FSP is for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years and it does not permit earlier application. However, the transition guidance requires retroactive application to all periods presented. This FSP will impact our accounting for our 6.00% Notes whereby the equity component will be included in the paid-in-capital portion of stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet and the value of the equity component will be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component. Higher interest expense will result by recognizing accretion of the discounted carrying value of the 6.00% Notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of the 6.00% Notes. We will adopt FSP APB 14-1 beginning in first quarter of 2009 and expect that the interest expense associated with our 6.00% Notes will be approximately $16 million, $25 million and $27 million higher for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income, net of $22 million in 2008 changed from other expense, net of $7 million in 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased $60 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $20 million in cash consideration. As a result, we recognized a gain of $39 million. In addition, we recognized a gain of $11 million on acquiring the put option related to our holdings of UBS ARS, representing the fair value of this financial instrument. These gains were partially offset by a $24 million other than temporary impairment charge related to our portfolio of ARS in 2008. In 2007, we incurred a charge of $22 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred in connection with out repayment of the October 2006 Term Loan, which was partially offset by a gain of $19 million on the sale of vacant land in Sunnyvale, California. Other expense, net of $7 million in 2007 decreased by $6 million from an other expense, net of $13 million in 2006 primarily due to a gain of $19 million on the sale of vacant land in Sunnyvale, California in 2007 and $6 million less in finance charges related to the Fab 36 Term Loan as compared to 2006. This decrease was offset by a non-recurring gain of $10 million associated with Spansion LLC’s repurchase of its 12.75% Senior 67 Table of Contents Subordinated Notes due 2016 in 2006, a higher net charge of $2 million in 2007 due to charges for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred in connection with our repayment of the October 2006 Term Loan and a reduction of $7 million in other income due primarily to impairment charges on an investment recorded in 2007. Equity in net loss of Spansion Inc. and other Following Spansion’s IPO in December 2005, our ownership interest was diluted from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent, and we no longer exercised control over Spansion’s operations. Therefore, starting from December 21, 2005, we used the equity method of accounting to account for our investment in Spansion. In 2006, we sold 21 million shares of Spansion Class A common stock and realized a gain of $6 million from the sale. During 2007, we sold 13,491,493 shares of Spansion Class A common stock. We received $157 million in net proceeds and realized a loss of $1 million. We continued to use the equity method of accounting to account for our investment in Spansion because, for accounting purposes, we were deemed to continue to have the ability to exercise significant influence over Spansion. On September 20, 2007, Dr. Ruiz, our Executive Chairman, resigned as Chairman of Spansion’s Board of Directors. We also transferred our one share of Class B common stock to Spansion and, accordingly, relinquished the right to appoint a director to Spansion’s Board of Directors. Therefore, we changed our accounting for our investment from the equity method of accounting to accounting for this investment as “available-for-sale” marketable securities. During 2007, we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of $111 million on our investment in Spansion after considering Spansion’s operating results, its stock price trends, and our intention to liquidate our investment. As a result, as of December 29, 2007, our investment in Spansion was reflected at its then fair market value of $56 million. During 2008, we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of $53 million after giving consideration to Spansion’s operating results and its stock price trends. As of December 27, 2008, we owned a total of 14,037,910 shares, or approximately 8.7 percent of Spansion’s outstanding common stock with a carrying value of $3 million, which we included in the caption “Marketable securities” on our 2008 consolidated balance sheet. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $68 million in 2008, $27 million in 2007 and $23 million in 2006. The income tax provision in 2008 primarily results from increases in net deferred tax liabilities in our German subsidiaries reduced by net current tax benefits in other jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2007 primarily results from current foreign taxes reduced by the reversal of deferred U.S. taxes related to indefinite-lived goodwill, resulting from the goodwill impairment charge we recorded during the year, and recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for tax holidays. The income tax provision in 2006 primarily results from current foreign taxes, plus deferred U.S. taxes related to indefinite-lived goodwill, and reduced by deferred foreign benefits from removing part of the valuation allowance on German net operating loss carryovers of Fab 36. As of December 27, 2008 substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets other than German deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continue to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 27, 2008 in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. Our gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $31 million during the year ended December 27, 2008. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that will affect the effective tax rate increased by $12 million during the year ended December 27, 2008, primarily due to a reduction in losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions net of the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain foreign jurisdictions. 68 Table of Contents Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits increased by a net $5 million and decreased by a net $10 million, respectively, for the year ended December 27, 2008. During the 12 months beginning December 28, 2008, we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $102 million ($22 million net of deferred tax gross-up) as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation and audit resolutions. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. However, the resolution of and/or closure on open audits is highly uncertain. As of December 27, 2008, the Canadian Revenue Agency, or CRA, is auditing ATI for the years 2000 – 2004. The audit has been completed and currently is in the review process. Also, as of December 27, 2008, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is auditing AMD’s tax years 2004 through 2006 and the German tax authorities are auditing our German subsidiaries for the tax years 2001 through 2004. We have several foreign, foreign provincial, and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time. We have provided for uncertain tax positions that require a FIN 48 liability. As a result of the application of FIN 48, we have recognized $94 million of current and long-term deferred tax assets, previously under a valuation allowance and have recorded $94 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 27, 2008. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 31, 2006 as well as employee stock purchases pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was allocated in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: Year EndedDecember 27,2008 Year EndedDecember 29,2007 Year EndedDecember 31,2006 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 10 $ 11 $ 8 Research and development 44 50 28 Marketing, general, and administrative 23 48 39 Total stock-based compensation expense 77 109 75 Tax benefit — — — Stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 77 $ 109 $ 75 Stock-based compensation included in discontinued operations was $2 million, $3 million and $2 million for the years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. As of December 27, 2008, we had $50 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 2.01 years. Also, as of December 27, 2008, we had $91 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 2.21 years. Stock-based compensation expense of $77 million in 2008 decreased $32 million compared to $109 million in 2007 primarily due to the suspension of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan in late 2007, which resulted in no corresponding charges in 2008, the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expenses related to certain performance based restricted stock unit grants because we concluded that the performance criteria were no longer achievable and a net decrease in overall stock-based compensation expense as a result of the lower average grant date fair value in 2008 as compared to 2007. 69 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation expense of $109 million in 2007 increased $34 million compared to $75 million in 2006 primarily due to the stock-based compensation expense related to awards that we assumed as part of the ATI acquisition for a full year in 2007, as opposed to only nine weeks in 2006. International Sales International sales as a percent of net revenue were 88 percent in 2008 and 2007 and 75 percent in 2006. The increase in international sales from 2006 to 2007 was attributable to the inclusion of sales of our graphics and chipsets products to contract manufacturers and add-in-board manufacturers based outside the United States, principally in China and Taiwan, for the full year in 2007 compared to 9 weeks in 2006. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 27, 2008 totaled $1.1 billion and our debt and capital lease obligations totaled $5 billion. We decided to divest our Digital Television business unit during the second quarter of 2008 and, as a result, classify it as discontinued operations for financial reporting. We completed the sale of this business in October 2008. The absence of any cash flows from our discontinued operations did not have a material impact on our liquidity and financial position. Accordingly, we have combined cash flows from discontinued operations with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow statement category discussed below. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $692 million in 2008. Non-cash charges included in our net loss of $3.1 billion consisted primarily of $1.7 billion of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible impairment charges, $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $83 million of stock-based compensation expense, $53 million of other than temporary impairment charges on our investment in Spansion and $24 million of other than temporary impairment charges on ARS. These charges were offset by a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment, the amortization of foreign grants and allowances of $107 million and a net gain of $39 million on our repurchase of $60 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $20 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 27, 2008 compared to December 29, 2007 included a decrease of $666 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflecting the effects of our cost cutting efforts, a decrease of $101 million in accounts receivable primarily due to a decrease in sales and improved cash collection efforts in 2008 and a decrease of $64 million in prepaid and other current assets primarily related to a decrease in receivables of foreign grants and allowances. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $310 million in 2007. Our net loss of $3.4 billion was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.6 billion of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible impairment charges, $1.3 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $155 million of other than temporary impairment charges and equity interest in the net loss of our investment in Spansion and $112 million of stock-based compensation expense. These charges were partially offset by amortization to income of foreign grants and subsidies of $167 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 29, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 included a decrease of $503 million in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease of $329 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase of $134 million in prepaid and other current assets. Our accounts receivable balance decreased due to greater efficiency in management and collection of accounts receivables. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased due to the timing of payments partially offset by increases in accrued interest and accruals for technology license payment obligations. The increase in prepaid and other assets was driven by increases in receivables for foreign grants and subsidies, purchases of technology licenses and an increase in prepaid insurance. 70 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. Our net loss of $166 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $837 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $416 million for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the ATI acquisition, stock-based compensation expense of $77 million, and $45 million related to an equity interest in the net loss of Spansion. These charges were partially offset by amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $151 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 25, 2005 included an increase of $530 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in payables to related parties of $229 million and an increase of $175 million in other assets. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily related to higher purchases of raw materials, technology license payment obligations, and marketing accruals due to increased operations in the Computing Solutions segment. The decrease in payables to related parties is a result of our no longer shipping products and invoicing customers on behalf of Spansion after the second quarter of 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we shipped products to and invoiced Spansion’s customers in our name on behalf of Spansion and remitted the receipts to Spansion. The increase in other assets was primarily due to purchases of new technology licenses. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $27 million in 2008. Payments of $624 million of cash used to purchase property, plant and equipment and $95 million in connection with the exercise of our call option to repurchase the partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG held by one of the unaffiliated partners, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG, were partially offset by $343 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily 200-millimeter equipment, $216 million in net proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities and $127 million of cash proceeds from sale of our Digital Television business unit. Of the total purchase price of $141.5 million, $14 million was held in escrow as of December 27, 2008. We are eligible to receive this amount within 18 months after the completion of the transaction, subject to specified conditions. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.7 billion in 2007. We used $1.7 billion to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $691 million to purchase equipment for Fab 36. We also purchased $545 million in available-for-sale securities. This was offset primarily by $307 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, $157 million in proceeds from sales of Spansion shares, and $73 million from sales of assets, including excess land in Sunnyvale, California and customer deposits on the sale of 200-millimeter wafer fabrication equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $4.3 billion in 2006. We used $3.9 billion, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, to acquire ATI, and $1.9 billion to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $987 million to purchase equipment for Fab 36. This was partially offset by a net cash inflow of $947 million from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, $278 million from sales of Spansion shares, and $175 million of proceeds from Spansion’s repurchase of its 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $220 million in 2008, primarily due to proceeds of $308 million from our accounts receivable arrangement with IBM Credit LLC and proceeds of grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of $121 million for the Fab 36 project and $40 million for the Fab 38 project. See “Contractual Obligations—Receivable Financing Arrangement Classified as Other Short-Term Obligations” below, for additional information. These amounts were partially offset by $166 million of payments on certain debt and cash obligations consisting of $20 million for the repurchase of $60 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes, $38 million for the exercise of our call option to repurchase the silent partnership contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG held by Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG, $25 million 71 Table of Contents for the mandatory repurchase of a portion of the silent partnership contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG held by Leipziger Messe and $19 million in payments for the guaranteed return on the unaffiliated limited partners’ limited partnership contributions. During 2008, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $2.0 billion in 2007 and consisted primarily of proceeds of: $2.2 billion from the issuance and sale of our 6.00% Notes during the second quarter of 2007; $1.5 billion from the issuance and sale of our 5.75% Notes during the third quarter of 2007; $608 million from the sale of our common stock to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company in the fourth quarter of 2007; $78 million from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of employee stock options; and $223 million of capital investment grants and allowances received from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, chiefly for the Fab 36 project. These proceeds were partially offset by the $2.2 billion repayment of our October 2006 Term Loan, a payment of $182 million for the purchase of a capped call in connection with the issuance of our 6.00% Notes and a payment of $46 million for our mandatory repurchase of silent partner contributions from our unaffiliated partners in AMD Fab 36 KG. During 2007, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flow. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $3.8 billion in 2006, and consisted primarily of proceeds of: $3.4 billion from borrowings under the October 2006 Term Loan and the Fab 36 Term Loan; proceeds of $495 million from the sale of our common stock in an equity offering; $231 million from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of employee stock options; and capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project of $210 million. These amounts were offset by $539 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, primarily due to our redemption of 35 percent of the aggregate principal amount outstanding (or $210 million) of our 7.75% Notes, and $284 million to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the October 2006 Term Loan. During 2006, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flow. Liquidity We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances at December 27, 2008, anticipated cash flow from operations and available external financing will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital investments over the next twelve months. We anticipate that capital expenditures for 2009 will consist of approximately $760 million of The Foundry Company’s capital expenditures, which include anticipated expenditures related to Fab 38 and a planned new wafer fabrication facility on the Luther Forest Technology Campus in Saratoga County, New York, and $150 million of capital expenditures for which we will have responsibility for aggregate consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $910 million. During 2008, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased from $1.9 billion in 2007 to $1.1 billion in 2008 primarily due to the losses that were incurred in 2008. We have taken and plan to continue to undertake a number of actions to decrease our expenses. For example, in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008 we implemented restructuring plans to reduce our expenses. The plans primarily involve the termination of employees. In addition, the restructuring plan implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 involves additional cost reduction actions, including contract or program terminations and facility site consolidations and closures that either have taken place during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 or will take place in 2009. We also plan to reduce our manufacturing output in order to control our inventory levels. For 2008 our restructuring charges were $90 million, of which approximately $28 million will result in cash expenditures in 2009. As a result of the 2008 restructuring activities, we expect that our cash savings in 2009 will be approximately $110 million. 72 Table of Contents In addition, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, we anticipate certain benefits to our business, including an increase in our cash balance, on a consolidated basis, by approximately $2.2 billion, of which approximately $800 million will be available for current working capital purposes and $1.4 billion will go to The Foundry Company to fund its operations, including capital expenditures. In addition, although we will consolidate the accounts of The Foundry Company after the consummation of the transactions, because we will be contributing to The Foundry Company our ownership interests in the German subsidiaries that owe approximately $1.1 billion (as of December 27, 2008) of indebtedness, The Foundry Company will be obligated to repay this indebtedness after the consummation of the transactions. The Foundry Company will record $1 billion of the $1.4 billion as debt from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to ATIC and $400 million as equity from the issuance of securities to ATIC. Because we will consolidate the accounts of The Foundry Company after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, our consolidated balance sheet will present the $1.1 billion (as of December 27, 2008) of transferred indebtedness and the $1 billion of debt related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes as debt and the $400 million as non-controlling interest. However, The Foundry Company will have the obligation to repay the transferred indebtedness and the Convertible Notes. Also, future wafer manufacturing capital expenditures will be the responsibility of The Foundry Company, and after the consummation of the transactions, we will have the option but not the obligation to provide future funding to The Foundry Company in an amount pro-rata to our interest in the fully converted shares of The Foundry Company. ATIC has committed to provide additional equity funding to The Foundry Company of at least $3.6 billion and up to $6.0 billion over the five years after the closing of the transactions. In November 2008, we repurchased $60 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for approximately $20 million in cash. In February 2009, we repurchased approximately $158 million in principal amount of the 6.00% Notes for approximately $57 million in cash. We may elect to continue to purchase or otherwise retire our 6.00% Notes, 5.75% Notes or 7.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Over the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. However, recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies continuing into 2009. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession, the availability and cost of credit, and the global housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies. These conditions, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels. As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers. These factors have lead to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike, and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending. Continued turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. 73 Table of Contents If these market conditions continue deteriorating further, they may limit our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, on favorable terms or at all, resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. Auction Rate Securities. The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our auction rate securities (ARS) and auctions for these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. While these securities are currently illiquid, there have been no defaults and all interest has been received when due. During 2008, we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of $24 million related to our ARS. In October 2008, UBS AG (UBS) offered to repurchase all of the ARS that we purchased from them prior to February 13, 2008. As of December 27, 2008, we owned $82 million par value of these securities. We accepted this offer. From June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell, at par, these ARS to UBS. We initially recorded the put option at its estimated fair value as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet, with the corresponding gain recorded in earnings as other income. For future periods, the put option will be marked to market each quarter, with changes in its estimated fair value recorded in earnings as other income (expense). In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we reclassified the underlying UBS ARS from the “available-for-sale” category to the “trading securities” category. Changes to the estimated fair value of these ARS are recorded in earnings following this reclassification. As of December 27, 2008, we classified our investments in ARS as current assets because we reasonably expect that we will be able to sell these securities and have the proceeds available for use in our operations within the next twelve months. Although there may not be successful future auctions, we believe there will be other channels through which we may sell the ARS. Specific factors we considered in determining that our ARS should be classified as short-term marketable securities and included as current assets are as follows: • We have had redemptions, at par, totaling $26 million throughout the period of failed auctions. • We are receiving above market rates of interest on the ARS without any default. We believe the issuers have an incentive to refinance because of higher interest rates compared with market rates demonstrated by redemptions we received during the year. • Federal and state governments are stepping in to provide guaranteed new student loans, as well as purchasing the loans, which we believe will create a secondary market for these securities. • In informal discussions with staff members at brokerage firms, we have been informed that brokerage firms continue in their efforts to create a new market for these securities by working with issuers to refinance the existing instruments into a new form of security or reducing the maturity to attract investors. With respect to $82 million of our ARS, prior to June 30, 2010, UBS, at its sole discretion, may sell, or otherwise dispose of, and/or enter orders in the auctions process with respect to these securities on our behalf so long as we receive par value for the ARS sold. UBS has also agreed to use their best efforts to facilitate issuer redemptions and/or to resolve the liquidity concerns of holders of their ARS through restructurings and other means. However, we are not dependant on liquidating our ARS in the next twelve months in order to meet our liquidity needs. At this time, we believe that the current illiquidity of these investments is temporary. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation by considering factors including the success or continued failure of future auctions, possible failure of the investments to be redeemed, deterioration of the credit ratings of the investments, market risk and other factors. Such a reassessment may change the classification of these investments to long-term, or result in a conclusion that these investments are further impaired. If we determine that the fair value of our ARS has further declined and such a decline is temporary, we would record a temporary impairment within 74 Table of Contents other comprehensive income, a component of our stockholders’ equity. If we determine that such decline in fair value is other than temporary, we would record further impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual cash obligations at December 27, 2008, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period Total Fiscal2009 Fiscal2010 Fiscal2011 Fiscal2012 Fiscal2013 Fiscal 2014and beyond (In millions) 5.75% Senior Notes due 2012 $ 1,500 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,500 $ — $ — 6.00% Senior Notes due 2015 2,140 — — — — — 2,140 Fab 36 Term Loan 705 246 290 169 — — — Obligations to repurchase Fab 36 silent partner interests(1) 28 28 — — — — — 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 390 — — — 390 — — Other long-term liabilities 38 — 23 9 4 2 — Aggregate interest obligation(2) 1,462 297 281 271 240 154 219 Obligations under capital leases(3) 398 40 41 40 41 41 195 Operating leases 267 57 58 32 25 21 74 Unconditional purchase commitments(4) 2,015 413 272 212 219 226 673 Total contractual obligations $ 8,943 $ 1,081 $ 964 $ 734 $ 2,419 $ 444 $ 3,301 (1) Represents the amount of silent partnership contributions that our subsidiaries are required to repurchase from Leipziger Messe and is exclusive of the guaranteed rate of return. See “Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements,” below. (2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations on our outstanding debt obligations, excluding capital lease obligations, including the guaranteed rate of return on Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership contributions, which is based on our assumptions regarding wafer output. (3) Includes principal and imputed interest. (4) We have unconditional purchase commitments for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase commitments in the table above. Also, purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 On August 14, 2007, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012. The 5.75% Notes bear interest at 5.75% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2008 until the maturity date of August 15, 2012. The terms of the 5.75% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 5.75% Indenture), dated as of August 14, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. The 5.75% Notes will be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 5.75% Notes, into shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 49.6771 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.75% Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $20.13 per share. This initial conversion price represents a premium of 50% relative to the last reported sale price of our common stock on August 8, 2007 (the trading date preceding the date of pricing of the 5.75% Notes) of $13.42 per share. This 75 Table of Contents initial conversion rate will be adjusted for certain anti-dilution events. In addition, the conversion rate will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) of AMD under certain circumstances. Holders of the 5.75% Notes may require us to repurchase the 5.75% Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) or a termination of trading (as defined in the Indenture). Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 5.75% Notes. The 5.75% Notes rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated debt. The 5.75% Notes rank junior in right of payment to all our existing and future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of our subsidiaries. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting discounts, commissions and offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $1.5 billion. We used all of the net proceeds, together with available cash, to repay in full the remaining outstanding balance of the October 2006 Term Loan. All security interests under the October 2006 Term Loan were released. In connection with this repayment, we recorded a charge of approximately $17 million to write off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the October 2006 Term Loan. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 5.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 On April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015. The 6.00% Notes bear interest at 6.00% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015. The terms of the 6.00% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 6.00% Indenture), dated April 27, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. Upon the occurrence of certain events described in the 6.00% Indenture, the 6.00% Notes will be convertible into cash up to the principal amount, and if applicable, into shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes (the 6.00% Conversion Shares) in respect of any conversion value above the principal amount, based on an initial conversion rate of 35.6125 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 6.00% Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $28.08 per share. This initial conversion price represents a premium of 100% relative to the last reported sale price of our common stock on April 23, 2007 (the trading date preceding the date of pricing of the 6.00% Notes) of $14.04 per share. The conversion rate will be adjusted for certain anti-dilution events. In addition, the conversion rate will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture) under certain circumstances. Holders of the 6.00% Notes may require us to repurchase the 6.00% Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or a termination of trading (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture). Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 6.00% Notes. The 6.00% Notes rank equally with our existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of our future subordinated debt. The 6.00% Notes rank junior to all of our existing and future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of our subsidiaries. In connection with the issuance of the 6.00% Notes, on April 24, 2007, we purchased a capped call with Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc., or Lehman Brother Derivatives, represented by Lehman Brothers 76 Table of Contents Inc. The capped call had an initial strike price of $28.08 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which matches the initial conversion price of the 6.00% Notes, and a cap price of $42.12 per share. The capped call was intended to reduce the potential common stock dilution to then existing stockholders upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes because the call option allowed us to receive shares of common stock from the counterparty generally equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes. Lehman Brothers Derivatives filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on October 4, 2008, which was an event of default under the capped call arrangement, giving us the immediate right to terminate the transaction and entitling us to claim reimbursement for the loss in terminating and closing out the capped call transaction. On December 15, 2008, we delivered a notice of termination to Lehman Brothers Derivatives of the capped call transaction. The Lehman Brothers Derivatives bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing and our ability to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes through the capped call transaction has effectively been eliminated. As a result of the uncertain recoverability of this counterparty exposure, we are unable to predict whether, and to what extent, we may be able to recover any of our losses under the capped call transaction. Moreover, our termination of the capped call transaction resulted in disadvantageous tax consequences to us. Specifically, we recognized approximately $1.4 billion of taxable gains for 2008, which were fully offset by our losses in 2008. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting discounts, commissions and offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $2.2 billion. We used approximately $182 million of the net proceeds to purchase the capped call and applied $500 million of the net proceeds to prepay a portion of the amount outstanding under the October 2006 Term Loan. In connection with this repayment, we recorded a charge of approximately $5 million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the October 2006 Term Loan repayment. In November 2008, we purchased $60 million in principal amount of the 6.00% Notes by paying approximately $20 million in cash, which resulted in a gain of approximately $39 million. The gain is included in the caption, “Other income (expense), net,” on our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. In February 2009, we repurchased an aggregate of $158 million in principle amount of the 6.00% Notes for approximately $57 million cash. We expect to record a gain in the first quarter of 2009. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB No. 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). This FSP requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The effective date of this FSP is for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years and it does not permit earlier application. However, the transition guidance requires retroactive application to all periods presented. This FSP will impact our accounting for our 6.00% Notes whereby the equity component would be included in the paid-in-capital portion of stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component. Higher interest expense will result by recognizing accretion of the discounted carrying value of the 6.00% Notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of the 6.00% Notes. We expect to have higher interest expense beginning in its first quarter of 2009 due to the interest accretion, and the interest expense associated with its 6.00% Notes for prior periods will also be higher than previously reported due to the retrospective application of this FSP. Based on the preliminary analysis performed by us, the interest expense associated with its 6.00% Notes will be approximately $16 million, $25 million and $27 million higher for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, as a result of adopting this FSP. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 6.00% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 77 Table of Contents Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements Our 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36, is located in Dresden, Germany at our wafer fabrication site. Fab 36 is owned by AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG (or AMD Fab 36 KG), a German limited partnership. We control the management of AMD Fab 36 KG through a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 LLC, which is a general partner of AMD Fab 36 KG. AMD Fab 36 KG is our indirect consolidated subsidiary. To date, we have provided a significant portion of the financing for Fab 36. In addition to our financing, Leipziger Messe GmbH, a nominee of the State of Saxony, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH, an investment consortium arranged by M+W Zander Facility Engineering GmbH, the general contractor for the project, and a consortium of banks have provided financing for the project. Leipziger Messe is the remaining limited partner in AMD Fab 36 KG. We have also received grants and allowances from federal and state German authorities for the Fab 36 project. The funding to construct and facilitize Fab 36 included: • equity contributions from us of $713 million under the partnership agreements, revolving loans from us of up to approximately $1.1 billion, and guarantees from us for amounts owed by AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliates to the lenders and unaffiliated partners; • investments of approximately $450 million from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs; • a loan of approximately 700 million euro from a consortium of banks, which was fully drawn as of December 2006; • up to approximately $764 million of subsidies consisting of grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG, of which $627 million of cash has been received as of December 27, 2008; • up to approximately $32 million allowances, from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, depending on the level of capital investments in connection with expansion of production capacity in Fab 36, of which $9 million has been received as of December 27, 2008; and • a loan guarantee from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders referenced above after foreclosure on all other security. We have contributed to AMD Fab 36 KG the full amount of equity required under the partnership agreements and no loans from us were outstanding. These equity amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. On April 21, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG entered into a 700 million euro Term Loan Facility Agreement among AMD Fab 36 KG, as borrower, and a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, as lenders, dated April 21, 2004 (Fab 36 Term Loan) and other related agreements (collectively, the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate Fab 36. The consortium of banks agreed to make available up to $893 million in loans to AMD Fab 36 KG upon its achievement of specified milestones, including attainment of “technical completion” at Fab 36, which required certification by the banks’ technical advisor that AMD Fab 36 KG had a wafer fabrication process suitable for high-volume production of advanced microprocessors, had achieved specified levels of average wafer starts per week and average wafer yields, and had completed capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion. Effective as of October 10, 2006, we amended the terms of the Fab 36 Term Loan to, among other things, permit us to borrow in US dollars, subject to certain conditions. In October 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG borrowed $645 million under the Fab 36 Term Loan (the First Installment). In December 2006, AMD Fab 36 KG borrowed $248 million under the Fab 36 Term Loan (the Second Installment). As of December 27, 2008, AMD Fab 36 KG had borrowed the full amount available under the Fab 36 Term Loan and the total amount outstanding under the 78 Table of Contents Fab 36 Term Loan was $705 million. AMD Fab 36 KG may select an interest period of one, two, or three months or any other period agreed between AMD Fab 36 KG and the lenders. The rate of interest on each installment for the interest period selected is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin, plus LIBOR plus minimum reserve cost if any. As of December 27, 2008, the rate of interest for the initial interest period was 6.51 percent for the First Installment and 5.63688 percent for the Second Installment. This loan is repayable in quarterly installments, which commenced in September 2007 and terminates in March 2011. An aggregate of $188 million has been repaid as of December 27, 2008. The amended and restated Fab 36 Term Loan also sets forth certain covenants applicable to AMD Fab 36 KG. For example, for as long as group consolidated cash is at least $1 billion, our credit rating is at least B3 by Moody’s and B- by Standard & Poor’s, and no event of default has occurred, the only financial covenant that AMD Fab 36 KG is required to comply with is a loan to fixed asset value covenant. Specifically, the loan to fixed asset value (as defined in the agreement) as at the end of any relevant period specified in Column A below cannot exceed the percentage set out opposite such relevant period in Column B below: Column A Column B (Relevant Period) (Maximum Percentage of Loan to Fixed Asset Value) up to and including 31 December 2008 50 percent up to and including 31 December 2009 45 percent thereafter 40 percent As of December 27, 2008, AMD Fab 36 KG was in compliance with this covenant. If group consolidated cash is less than $1 billion or our credit rating is below B3 by Moody’s and B- by Standard & Poor’s, AMD Fab 36 KG will also be required to maintain minimum cash balances equal to the lesser of 100 million euros and 50 percent of the total outstanding amount under the Fab 36 Term Loan. AMD Fab 36 KG may elect to maintain the minimum cash balance in an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars if group consolidated cash is at least $500 million. If on any scheduled repayment date, our credit rating is Caa2 or lower by Moody’s or CCC or lower by Standard & Poor’s, AMD Fab 36 must increase the minimum cash balances by 5 percent of the total outstanding amount, and at each subsequent request of Dresdner Bank, by a further 5 percent of the total outstanding amount until such time as either the credit rating increases to at least Ba3 by Moody’s and BB- by Standard & Poor’s or the minimum cash balances are equal to the total outstanding amounts. Our credit rating was B3 with Moody’s and B with Standard and Poor’s as of December 27, 2008. AMD Fab 36 KG pledged substantially all of its current and future assets as security under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, we pledged our equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding pledged its equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Admin and its partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG and AMD Fab 36 Admin and AMD Fab 36 LLC pledged all of their partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG. We guaranteed the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. We also guaranteed repayment of grants and allowances by AMD Fab 36 KG, should such repayment be required pursuant to the terms of the subsidies provided by the federal and state German authorities. Pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee Agreement among us, as guarantor, AMD Fab 36 KG, Dresdner Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG, Niederlassung Luxemburg, we have to comply with specified adjusted tangible net worth and EBITDA financial covenants if the sum of our group consolidated cash declines below the following amounts: Amount (in millions) if Moody’s Rating is at least if Standard & Poor’s Rating is at least $500 B1 or lower and B+ or lower 425 Ba3 and BB- 400 Ba2 and BB 350 Ba1 and BB+ 300 Baa3 or better and BBB-or better 79 Table of Contents As of December 27, 2008, group consolidated cash was greater than $500 million and, therefore, the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. If our group consolidated cash declines below the amounts set forth above, we would be required to maintain adjusted tangible net worth, determined as of the last day of each preceding fiscal quarter, of not less than the amounts set forth below: Measurement Date on fiscal quarter ending Amount(In millions) December 2005 $ 1,500 March 2006 and on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter $ 1,750 In addition, if our group consolidated cash declines below the amounts set forth above, we would be required to maintain EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) as of the last day of each preceding fiscal period set forth below in an amount not less than the amount set forth below opposite the date of such preceding fiscal period: Period Amount (In millions) For the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending December 2005 and for the four fiscal quarters ending on each fiscal quarter thereafter $850 and $750 on an annualized basis for the two most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to December 31, 2006 Also on April 21, 2004, AMD, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD that owns substantially all of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, and AMD Fab 36 Admin GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD Fab 36 Holding that owns the remainder of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, (collectively referred to as the AMD companies) entered into a series of agreements (the partnership agreements) with the original unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, relating to the rights and obligations with respect to their limited partner and silent partner contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG. The partnership was established for an indefinite period of time. A partner may terminate its participation in the partnership by giving twelve months advance notice to the other partners. The termination becomes effective at the end of the year following the year during which the notice is given. However, other than for good cause, a partner’s termination will not be effective before December 31, 2015. The partnership agreements set forth each limited partner’s aggregate capital contribution to AMD Fab 36 KG and the milestones for such contributions. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, AMD, through AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, provided an aggregate of $713 million, Leipziger Messe provided an aggregate of $281 million and Fab 36 Beteiligungs provided an aggregate of $169 million. The capital contributions of Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs were comprised of limited partnership contributions and silent partnership contributions. These contributions were due at various dates upon the achievement of milestones relating to the construction and operation of Fab 36. All of the capital contributions have been made in full. The partnership agreements also specify that the unaffiliated limited partners will receive a guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent per annum on their total investment depending upon the monthly wafer output of Fab 36. We guaranteed these payments by AMD Fab 36 KG. In April 2005, we amended the partnership agreements in order to restructure the proportion of Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership and limited partnership contributions. Although the total aggregate amount that Leipziger Messe has agreed to provide remained unchanged, the portion of its contribution that constitutes limited partnership interests was reduced by $70 million while the portion of its contribution that constitutes silent partnership interests was increased by a corresponding amount. In this report, we refer to this additional silent partnership contribution as the New Silent Partnership Amount. 80 Table of Contents Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements and subject to the prior consent of the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin have a call option over the limited partnership interests held by Leipziger Messe, first exercisable three and one-half years after Leipziger Messe has completed its capital contribution and every three years thereafter. In addition, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin had the same call option rights over the partnership interests held by Fab 36 Beteiligungs and exercised the option on April 1, 2008 for approximately $95 million related to its limited partnership interest and $38 million related to its silent partnership interest. As of December 27, 2008, the remaining unaffiliated limited partner, Leipziger Messe, held partnership interests of approximately $197 million, of which $169 million was for its limited partnership interests and $28 million was for its silent partnership interest. In addition, commencing five years after the completion of its capital contribution, Leipziger Messe has the right to sell its limited partnership interest to third parties (other than competitors), subject to a right of first refusal held by AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, or to put its limited partnership interest to AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The put option is thereafter exercisable every three years. Leipziger Messe also has a put option in the event they are outvoted at AMD Fab 36 KG partners’ meetings with respect to certain specified matters such as increases in the partners’ capital contributions beyond those required by the partnership agreements, investments significantly in excess of the business plan, or certain dispositions of the limited partnership interests of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The purchase price under the put option is Leipziger Messe’s capital account balance plus accumulated or accrued profits. The purchase price under the call option is the same amount, plus a premium of $4.9 million. The right of first refusal price is the lower of the put option price or the price offered by the third party that triggered the right. We guaranteed the payments under the put options. In addition, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are obligated to repurchase Leipziger Messe’s silent partnership interests in annual 25 percent installments. During 2008, we repurchased $25 million of silent partnership interests from Leipziger Messe. As of December 27, 2008, of the $113 million of Leipziger Messe’s original silent partnership interests, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin had repurchased an aggregate of $85 million. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we initially classified the portion of the silent partnership contribution that is mandatorily redeemable as debt on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value at the time of issuance because of the mandatory redemption features described in the preceding paragraph. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this debt towards its ultimate redemption value of the silent partnership contributions by the guaranteed annual rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We record this periodic accretion to redemption value as interest expense. Leipziger Messe’s limited partnership contributions and the New Silent Partnership Portion described above are not mandatorily redeemable, but rather are subject to redemption outside of the control of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. In consolidation, we initially record these contributions as minority interest, based on their fair value. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this minority interest toward its ultimate redemption value of these contributions by the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We classify this periodic accretion of redemption value as minority interest. No separate accounting is required for the put and call options because they are not freestanding instruments and not considered derivatives under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In addition to support from us and the consortium of banks referenced above, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony have agreed to support the Fab 36 project in the form of: • a loan guarantee equal to 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders after foreclosure on all other security; and • subsidies consisting of grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $764 million, depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG and $32 million allowances depending on the level of capital investments for expansion of production capacity at the Dresden site. 81 Table of Contents In connection with the receipt of investment grants for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2008 and is required to maintain this headcount through December 2013. We record these grants as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2013. Initially, we amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, we started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. Allowances are amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the investments because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy documents could result in the repayment of all or a portion of the amounts received to date. As of December 27, 2008, AMD Fab 36 KG received cash allowances of $407 million for capital investments made in 2003 through 2008 as well as cash grants of $211 million for capital investments made in 2003 through 2008. The Fab 36 Loan Agreements also require that we: • provide funding to AMD Fab 36 KG if cash shortfalls occur, including funding shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any defaults caused by AMD Fab 36 KG or its affiliates; and • guarantee 100 percent of AMD Fab 36 KG’s obligations under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements until the loans are repaid in full. Under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are generally prevented from paying dividends or making other payments to us. In addition, AMD Fab 36 KG would be in default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements if we or any of the AMD companies fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if, after the occurrence of the event, the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is adversely affected. Circumstances that could result in a default include: • our failure to provide loans to AMD Fab 36 KG as required under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • failure to pay any amount due under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements within five days of the due date; • occurrence of any event which the lenders reasonably believe has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets or condition of AMD Fab 36 KG or AMD or their ability to perform under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; • filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Fab 36 KG or any limited partner; • occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) of AMD; • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on payment of profits, dividends or other distributions except in limited circumstances and restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, disposing of assets and repaying subordinated debt; and • AMD Fab 36 KG’s noncompliance with certain financial covenants, including loan to fixed asset value ratio and, in certain circumstances, a minimum cash covenant. In general, any default with respect to other indebtedness of AMD or AMD Fab 36 KG that is not cured, would result in a cross-default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. The occurrence of a default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan. In addition, the occurrence of a default under 82 Table of Contents this agreement could result in a cross-default under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes, 6.00% Notes, and 5.75% Notes. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. In the event the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement are consummated and the approval of the lenders is received, our ownership interests in AMD Fab 36 Holding GmbH, AMD Fab 36 Admin GmbH, AMD Fab 36 KG and AMD Fab 36 LLC, the group of German subsidiaries that own Fab 36, as well as the Fab 36 Term Loan and related agreements will be transferred to The Foundry Company, whose financial results will continue to be consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, immediately prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin intend to repurchase the limited and silent partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG held by the remaining unaffiliated limited partner, Leipziger Messe who will withdraw as a partner of AMD Fab 36 KG. 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 On October 29, 2004, we issued $600 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On April 22, 2005, we exchanged these notes for publicly registered notes which have substantially identical terms as the old notes except that the publicly registered notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and, therefore, do not contain legends restricting their transfer. The 7.75% Notes mature on November 1, 2012. Interest on the 7.75% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, beginning May 1, 2005. From November 1, 2008, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price as Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on November 1, 2008 through October 31, 2009 103.875 percent Beginning on November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010 101.938 percent Beginning on November 1, 2010 through October 31, 2011 100.000 percent On November 1, 2011 100.000 percent Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 7.75% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.75% Notes at a repurchase price of 101 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the 7.75% Notes contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, which include all of our subsidiaries, from: • incurring additional indebtedness except specified permitted debt; • paying dividends and making other restricted payments; • making certain investments if an event of default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; • creating or permitting certain liens; • creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • using the proceeds from sales of assets; • entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidating, merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. 83 Table of Contents In February 2006, we redeemed 35 percent (or $210 million) of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 7.75% Notes. The holders of the 7.75% Notes received 107.75 percent of the principal amount of the 7.75% Notes plus accrued interest. In connection with this redemption, we recorded a charge of approximately $16 million, which represents the 7.75% redemption premium, and a charge of 4 million, which represents 35 percent of the unamortized issuance costs incurred in connection with the original issuance of the 7.75% Notes. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remaining principal outstanding under our 7.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 27, 2008, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $225 million. Included in this amount is $195 million in obligations under certain energy supply contracts which AMD entered into with local energy suppliers to provide our wafer fabrication facilities in Dresden, Germany with utilities (gas, electricity, heating and cooling) to meet the energy demands for our manufacturing requirements. We account for certain fixed payments due under these energy supply arrangements as capital leases pursuant to EITF Issue No. 01-8, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease and FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases. The capital lease obligations under the energy supply arrangements are payable in monthly installments through 2020. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2018. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Our total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 27, 2008 were $267 million, of which $38 million is accrued as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 and 2008 Restructuring Plans. We will make these payments through 2011. Unconditional Purchase Commitments Total non-cancelable purchase commitments as of December 27, 2008 were $2 billion for periods through 2020. These purchase commitments include $809 million related to contractual obligations of our Dresden facilities to purchase energy and gas and approximately $934 million representing future payments to IBM for the period from December 27, 2008 through 2015 pursuant to our amended and restated joint development agreement. As IBM’s services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, we expense the payments as incurred. The IBM agreement and the related payment obligations as well as the purchase commitments of our Dresden facilities to purchase energy and gas will be transferred to The Foundry Company upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement. The remaining purchase commitments also include non-cancelable contractual obligations to purchase raw materials, natural resources and office supplies. In connection with the acquisition of ATI, we made several commitments to the Minister of Industry under the Investment Canada Act including that we will: increase spending on research and development in Canada to a specified amount over the course of a three-year period when compared to ATI’s expenditures in this area in prior years; maintain Canadian employee headcount at specified levels by the end of the three-year anniversary of the acquisition; increase by a specified amount the number of our Canadian employees focusing on research and development; attain specified Canadian capital expenditures over a three-year period; maintain a presence in Canada via a variety of commercial activities for a period of five years; and nominate a Canadian for election to our Board of Directors over the next five years. The remaining minimum required Canadian capital expenditures 84 Table of Contents and research and development commitments are included in our aggregate unconditional purchase commitments. Our commitments relating to the parts of the Handheld and Digital Television business units that were divested no longer apply. We are in substantial compliance with the commitments. Receivable financing arrangement Classified as Other Short-Term Obligations On March 26, 2008, we entered into a Sale of Receivables – Supplier Agreement with IBM Credit LLC, or IBM Credit, and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd., or AMDISS, entered into the same sales agreement with IBM United Kingdom Financial Services Ltd., or IBM UK, pursuant to which we and AMDISS agreed to sell to each of IBM Credit and IBM UK certain receivables. Pursuant to the sales agreements, the IBM parties agreed to purchase from the AMD parties invoices of specified AMD customers up to credit limits set by the IBM parties for any applicable AMD customer. As of December 27, 2008, only selected distributor customers have participated in this program. Because we do not recognize revenue until our distributors sell our products to their customers, we classified funds received from the IBM parties as debt according to the requirement of EITF Issue No. 88-18, Sales of Future Revenues. The debt is reduced as the IBM parties receive payments from the distributors. As of December 27, 2008, $86 million was outstanding under these agreements. This amount appears as “Other short-term obligations” on our consolidated balance sheet and is not considered a cash commitment. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees of Indebtedness Recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet As of December 27, 2008, the principal guarantee related to indebtedness recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was for $28 million, which represents the amount of silent partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are required to repurchase from Leipziger Messe and does not include the guaranteed rate of return. This $28 million is expected to expire in 2009. No incremental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for this guarantee. Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin will repurchase the limited and silent partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG held by Leipziger Messe. Accordingly, the $28 million guarantee would expire upon the closing of the transactions. Guarantees of Indebtedness Not Recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co. KG (BAC) are joint ventures initially formed by AMD, Infineon Technologies AG (Infineon) and DuPont Photomasks, Inc. (Dupont) for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. We procure advanced photomasks from AMTC and use them in manufacturing our microprocessors. In April 2005, DuPont was acquired by Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Toppan, named Toppan Photomasks, Inc. (Toppan). In December 2007, Infineon entered into an assignment agreement to transfer its interest in AMTC and BAC to Qimonda AG (Qimonda), with the exception of certain AMTC/BAC related payment guarantees. The assignment became effective in January 2008. In December 2002, BAC obtained a euro denominated term loan to finance the construction of the photomask facility pursuant to which the equivalent of $39 million was outstanding as of December 27, 2008. Also in December 2002, each of Toppan Photomasks Germany GmbH, and AMTC, as lessees, entered into a lease agreement with BAC, as lessor. The term of the lease agreement is ten years. Each joint venture partner guaranteed a specific percentage of AMTC’s portion of the rental payments. Currently, Infineon, AMD and Toppan are the guarantors under the rental guarantee. The rental payments to BAC are in turn used by BAC to repay amounts outstanding under the BAC term loan. There is no separate guarantee outstanding for the BAC term loan. With respect to the lease agreement, AMTC may exercise a “step-in” right in which it would take over 85 Table of Contents Toppan Germany’s remaining rental payments in connection with the lease agreement between Toppan Photomask Germany and BAC. As of December 27, 2008, our guarantee of AMTC’s portion of the rental obligation was approximately $8 million. Our maximum liability in the event AMTC exercises its “step-in” right and the other joint venture partners default under the guarantee would be approximately $73 million. These estimates are based upon forecasted rents to be charged by BAC in the future and are subject to change based upon the actual usage of the facility by the tenants and foreign currency exchange rates. In December 2007, AMTC entered into a euro denominated revolving credit facility, pursuant to which the equivalent of $66 million was outstanding as of December 27, 2008. With the lenders’ consent, AMTC may request that the loan amount be increased by an additional amount of euro (equivalent to approximately $56 million as of December 27, 2008). The term of the revolving credit facility is three years. Upon request by AMTC and subject to certain conditions, the term of the revolving credit facility may be extended by two additional one-year periods. Pursuant to a guarantee agreement, each joint venture partner guaranteed one third of AMTC’s outstanding loan balance under the revolving credit facility. In September 2008, Qimonda provided cash security equal to one third of AMTC’s outstanding loan balance pursuant to a cash pledge agreement and was released from the guarantee agreement. The obligations of the remaining joint venture partners under the guarantee agreement remain the same. As of December 27, 2008, our potential obligation under this guarantee was the equivalent of $22 million plus our portion of accrued interest and expenses. Our maximum potential liability under this guarantee in the event the AMTC revolving credit facility is increased as set for above would be approximately $32 million plus our portion of accrued interest and expenses. Under the terms of the guarantee, if our group consolidated cash (which is defined as cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities less the aggregate amount outstanding under any revolving credit facility) is less than or expected to be less than $500 million, we will be required to provide cash collateral equal to one third of the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We evaluated this guarantee under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45) and concluded it was immaterial to our financial position or results of operations. Upon approval of the partners and banks, our partnership interests in the AMTC and the BAC will be transferred to The Foundry Company subsequent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement. In January 2009, Qimonda filed an application with the local court in Munich to commence insolvency proceedings. The local Munich court appointed a preliminary insolvency administrator to act on behalf of Qimonda. Under the AMTC revolving credit facility, Qimonda’s application for insolvency is considered an event of default and upon the demand of two thirds of the lenders, all the amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be immediately due and payable. AMTC has received a waiver from the lenders to waive the event of default until February 27, 2009. Under the BAC term loan, an insolvency of a partner does not constitute an event of default. However, an event of default may be triggered under the BAC term loan under certain circumstances, such as an event that results in a material adverse effect on the joint venture, or if a partner ceases to continue its business or does not fulfill certain material obligations. Outlook Our outlook disclosure is based on current expectations and contains forward-looking statements. Reference should be made to “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of Part I, Item 1—Business. For a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in the following disclosure, see the “Risk Factors” section in this report and such other risks and uncertainties as set forth in this report or detailed in our other SEC reports and filings. In light of the current macroeconomic conditions and the continued corrections in the supply chain, we expect revenue to decrease in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, as a result of the additional head count reductions and other cost cutting measures announced in January 2009, we expect to record restructuring charges in the first and second quarters of 2009. 86 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations During the second quarter of 2008, we evaluated the viability of our non-core businesses and determined that our Handheld and Digital Television business units were not directly aligned with our core strategy of computing and graphics market opportunities. As a result of this evaluation, we decided to divest our Handheld and Digital Television business units. As a result of our decision to divest these business units, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the second quarter of 2008 and concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and certain acquisition-related intangible assets associated with the Handheld and Digital Television business units were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $876 million. See Part II, Item 7 “MD&A—2008 Impairment,” above. During the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with Broadcom Corporation to sell the Digital Television business unit for $192.8 million. The agreement was subsequently amended to reduce the purchase price to $141.5 million and the transaction was completed on October 27, 2008. Based on the final terms of the sale transaction, we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $135 million. As a result of the decisions and transactions described above, pursuant to FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144), the assets related to the Digital Television business are presented as assets of discontinued operations on the 2007 consolidated balance sheet and the operating results of the Digital Television business are presented in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Although our plans and negotiations through the end of the third quarter of 2008 indicated that the discontinued operations criteria of SFAS 144 were met for the Handheld business unit, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that, based on the ongoing negotiations related to the divestiture of our Handheld business unit, the discontinued operations classification criteria for this business unit were no longer met as of December 27, 2008. As a result, we classified the assets, liabilities, and operating results of the Handheld business unit back into continuing operations. Our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented have been recast to conform to this reclassification. In January 2009, we completed the sale of certain graphics and multimedia technology assets and intellectual property that were formerly the basis of our Handheld business unit to Qualcomm Incorporated for $65 million in cash. In addition, certain employees of the Handheld business were transferred to Qualcomm. The assets that we sold to Qualcomm had a carrying value of approximately $32 million and were recorded as assets held for sale and were included in the caption, “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” in our 2008 consolidated balance sheet. As part of our agreement with Qualcomm, we retained the AMD Imageon™ media processor brand and the right to continue selling the products that were part of the Handheld business unit. We intend to support our existing handheld products and customers through the current product lifecycles. However, we do not intend to develop any new handheld products or engage new customer programs beyond those already committed. The results from discontinued operations relative to our Digital Television business unit are as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Revenue $ 73 $ 155 $ 22 Expenses (147 ) (230 ) (52 ) Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets (609 ) (476 ) — Restructuring charges (1 ) — — Loss from discontinued operations $ (684 ) $ (551 ) $ (30 ) The carrying value of the assets of discontinued operations was $759 million as of December 29, 2007. Included in this balance is goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the amounts of $743 million. Assets of 87 Table of Contents discontinued operations only include the assets related to our Digital Television business unit acquired by Broadcom. Cash flows from discontinued operations were not material and were combined with cash flows from continuing operations within the consolidated statement of cash flows categories. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). Under SFAS 141(R), an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred; that restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date; and that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes. In addition, acquired in-process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—An Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 will require that non-controlling interests in subsidiaries be reported as a component of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet. SFAS 160 also requires that earnings or losses attributed to the non-controlling interests be reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense, as well as requires disclosure of the attribution of consolidated earnings to the controlling and non-controlling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of operations. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and must be applied on a prospective basis. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, the non-controlling interest related to ATIC will be accounted for under this new accounting pronouncement. We do not believe that this pronouncement will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). This statement requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with earlier application encouraged. We will adopt SFAS 161 in the first quarter of 2009. Since SFAS 161 requires additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging activities, adoption of SFAS 161 will not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The adoption of SFAS 161 will change our disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning in the first quarter of 2009. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, (FSP 142-3) that amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142. FSP 142-3 requires a consistent approach between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an asset under SFAS 141(R). The FSP also requires enhanced disclosures when an intangible asset’s expected future cash flows are affected by an entity’s intent and/or ability to renew or extend the arrangement. FSP 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is applied prospectively. Early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of FSP 142-3 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). This FSP requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to 88 Table of Contents separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The effective date of this FSP is for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years and it does not permit earlier application. However, the transition guidance requires retroactive application to all periods presented. This FSP will impact our accounting for the 6.00% Notes whereby the equity component would be included in the paid-in-capital portion of stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component. Higher interest expense will result by recognizing accretion of the discounted carrying value of the 6.00% Notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of the 6.00% Notes. We expect to have higher interest expense beginning in its first quarter of 2009 due to the interest accretion, and the interest expense associated with its 6.00% Notes for prior periods will also be higher than previously reported due to the retrospective application of this FSP. Based on our preliminary analysis, the interest expense associated with the 6.00% Notes will be approximately $16 million, $25 million and $27 million higher for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, as a result of adopting this FSP. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. (FSP FAS 157-3) This FSP clarifies the application of FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. In particular, it provides additional guidance on (a) how the reporting entity’s own assumptions (that is, expected cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates) should be considered when measuring fair value when relevant observable inputs do not exist, (b) how available observable inputs in a market that is not active should be considered when measuring fair value, and (c) how the use of market quotes (for example, broker quotes or pricing services for the same or similar financial assets) should be considered when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable inputs available to measure fair value. This FSP is effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued. We evaluated this FSP and concluded that our analysis in determining the fair value of our financial assets when the market for them is not active is consistent with the FSP’s guidance. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 27, 2008, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of money market funds, bank notes, short-term corporate notes and ARS. With the exception of our ARS, these were highly liquid investments. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. In November 2008, we purchased $60 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes, which reduced the outstanding balance to $2.14 billion as of December 27, 2008 from $2.2 billion as of December 29, 2007. In February 2009, we repurchased approximately $158 million in principal amount of the 6.00% Notes for approximately $57 million in cash. As of December 27, 2008, the majority of our outstanding debt is fixed rate debt. Therefore, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is limited. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. 89 Table of Contents There has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during 2008. This period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk. The value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of such securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades. In light of the current market conditions and these additional risks, we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 27, 2008, substantially all of our investments are AAA rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated, as there are circumstances outside of our control. Currently, we believe the current credit market difficulties do not have a material impact on our financial position. However, a future degradation in credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. As of December 27, 2008, we had approximately $160 million investments in ARS after recording an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $24 million during 2008. During 2008, the market conditions for these ARS deteriorated due to the uncertainties in the credit markets. As a result, we were not able to sell our ARS as scheduled in the auction market. See “Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report for further information. The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 27, 2008: Fiscal2009 Fiscal2010 Fiscal2011 Fiscal2012 Fiscal2013 Thereafter Total Fiscal 2008Fair Value (In millions except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 252 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 252 $ 252 Weighted-average rate 0.92 % — — — — — 0.92 % Variable rate amounts $ 547 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 547 $ 547 Weighted-average rate 1.94 % — — — — — 1.94 % Marketable securities Variable rate amounts $ 184 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 184 $ 160 Weighted-average rate 2.86 % — — — — — 2.86 % Long-term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 31 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 31 $ 31 Weighted-average rate 1.75 % — — — — — 1.75 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,014 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,014 $ 990 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ 28 $ — $ — $ 1,890 $ — $ 2,140 $ 4,058 $ 1,365 Weighted-average rate 13.00 % — — 6.16 % — 7.21 % 6.76 % Variable rate amounts $ 332 $ 290 $ 170 $ — $ — $ — $ 792 $ 792 Weighted-average rate 2.67 % 3.47 % 3.47 % — — — 3.13 % Total Debt Obligations $ 360 $ 290 $ 170 $ 1,890 $ — $ 2,140 $ 4,850 $ 2,157 90 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk. As of December 27, 2008, as a result of our foreign operations, we had costs, assets and liabilities that were denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro and Canadian dollar. For example, some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of ATI in October 2006, some of our expenses and debt is denominated in Canadian dollars. Furthermore, as a result of a new sales program that has been implemented in China, some of our sales in China are now denominated in Chinese Renminbi. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. We use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Realized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward contracts, net of changes in the value of the hedged exposures, for the year ended December 27, 2008 were not material. As of December 27, 2008, we had unrealized losses of $26 million that were recorded to other comprehensive income. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future, since we expect that these unrealized losses will be offset by decreases in future cash flows of the items being hedged. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. In particular, generally we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll, equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2009 and related notes, which are included in this Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction We are a global semiconductor company that designs and sells microprocessors, chipsets and graphics processors. Within the global semiconductor industry, we offer primarily: • x86 microprocessors, for the commercial and consumer markets, embedded microprocessors for commercial, commercial client and consumer markets and chipsets for desktop and notebook PCs, professional workstations and servers; and • graphics, video and multimedia products for desktop and notebook PCs, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers, and technology for game consoles. In March 2009, we formed GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF), a manufacturing joint venture, with Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (ATIC), and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), acting through its general partner, West Coast Hitech G.P. Ltd. (See below for further discussion regarding GF). In MD&A, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2009 compared to 2008 and 2008 compared to 2007, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. For accounting purposes, we were required to consolidate the accounts of GF and its consolidated subsidiaries from March 2, 2009 through December 26, 2009. Accordingly, for this period, references in this Item 7 and in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to “us,” “our,” or “AMD” include the consolidated operating results of AMD and its consolidated subsidiaries and GF and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview Fiscal 2009 was a transformational year in which we emerged with a new business model focused on semiconductor design that leverages our technology portfolio of x86 microprocessor and graphics technologies. The credit market crisis and other macroeconomic challenges that affected the global economy in 2008 continued and contributed to a challenging business environment for us during the first half of 2009. In particular, due to the credit markets and the reduced leverage in the economy, both business and consumer spending, including with respect to end-user products that incorporate our products, was at depressed levels during the first half of 2009. In light of the economic environment, one of our key priorities entering 2009 was to preserve cash and reduce operating expenses. To that end, in the first quarter of 2009 we continued to implement the cost reduction activities that we began in 2008 through additional headcount reductions, temporary salary reductions for employees in the United States and Canada and suspension of certain employee benefits. During 2009, we also decreased our capital expenditures to $466 million compared to $621 million in 2008 and reduced our manufacturing output in order to control our inventory levels. In March 2009, we formed GF, a manufacturing joint venture to which we contributed our front-end manufacturing assets, thereby significantly decreasing the cost-intensive burden of building and operating our own fabrication facilities. In the second half of 2009, end user PC demand stabilized. During this time we delivered visually-rich platforms, higher-performance six-core server processors and industry-leading graphics products. In an improving global macroeconomic environment, we saw increased customer and end user demand for our 42 Table of Contents products, especially our six-core AMD Opteron processors for servers, which we introduced in June 2009 and our ATI Radeon 5000 series of GPUs, which we introduced in September 2009. We also settled the AMD-Intel litigation in November 2009, resulting in a new patent cross-licensing agreement, unprecedented ground-rules for fair competition in the microprocessor industry and a cash settlement of $1.25 billion for AMD. As economic conditions and our performance improved in the fourth quarter of 2009, we also restored salaries to pre-reduction levels, and in the first quarter of 2010, we will make a one-time payment to restore the full salary for the September through November 2009 period to all of our employees who participated in the salary reduction during that time. Net revenue for 2009 was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 7 percent compared to 2008 net revenue of $5.8 billion. Net revenue in 2008 included $191 million of process technology license revenue related to the sale of 200 millimeter equipment. Excluding the favorable impact of this process technology license revenue, which we believe gives a more comparable view of net revenue, 2009 net revenue would have declined 4 percent compared to 2008 due to a 5 percent decrease in the net revenue of our Computing Solutions segment. The decrease in our Computing Solutions segment net revenue was due to a significant decrease in average selling price throughout 2009. Competitive market conditions and the macroeconomic challenges that affected the global economy during the first half of 2009 caused us to decrease the price of many of our Computing Solutions products and also contributed to a shift in our product mix to lower end microprocessors. However, buoyed by an improving economy and increasing demand for our products, net revenue of our Computing Solutions segment improved 39 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and 14 percent compared to the third quarter of 2009 due to a significant increase in unit shipments. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 42 percent in 2009, a 2 percentage point increase compared to 40 percent in 2008. Gross margin in 2009 included a $171 million, or 3 percent, benefit related to the sale of inventory that had been written-down in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margin in 2008 included a $191 million, or 2 percent, favorable impact from process technology license revenue recorded in our Computing Solutions segment and a $227 million, or 4 percent, negative impact from an incremental write-down of inventory. Without the effect of the above events in 2009 and 2008, which we believe gives a more comparable view, gross margin would have been 39 percent in 2009 compared to 42 percent in 2008. Gross margin in the first half of 2009 was adversely impacted by depressed average selling price and the under-utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for our microprocessor products. However, the adverse impact of these factors on 2009 gross margin was partially mitigated by developments during the second half of 2009, including improvements in utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities and improvements in our unit costs primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of microprocessors that were manufactured using 45 nm process technology. Our operating income for 2009 was $664 million compared to an operating loss of $2.0 billion in 2008. In 2008, the operating loss included a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment, $191 million of process technology license revenue and $1.1 billion in impairment charges and charges related to the write-down of assets. In the fourth quarter of 2009, operating income included $1,242 million of income from the settlement of our litigation with Intel. Without the impact of these events, which we believe gives a more comparable view, our operating income would have improved $672 million due principally to a $437 million decrease in our research and development and marketing general and administrative expenses primarily due to the effect of our cost reduction initiatives. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 26, 2009 were $2.7 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 27, 2008. Of the $2.7 billion cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $904 million constituted GF cash and cash equivalents. This increase was primarily due to proceeds received upon the consummation of the GF manufacturing joint venture transaction in the first quarter of 2009, proceeds of $1.25 billion from the settlement of our litigation with Intel and $440 million from the issuance of our 8.125% Notes, partially offset by approximately $1.8 billion in payments for the redemption and repurchase of our outstanding debt. 43 Table of Contents In 2009, we also made significant progress in improving our balance sheet by significantly reducing our debt. Without taking into account GF’s indebtedness, during 2009 we reduced our debt by approximately $1.2 billion. We enter 2010 with a new business model, compelling products and stronger customer demand in an improved economic environment. In addition, beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we will no longer consolidate the operations of GF. As a result, we expect that in the future, our consolidated cost of sales will be higher and operating expenses will be lower. We also expect that interest expense will be significantly lower because we no longer consolidate GF’s indebtedness. GLOBALFOUNDRIES On March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, ATIC, and WCH, pursuant to which we formed GF. At the Closing, we contributed certain assets and liabilities to GF, including, among other things, shares of the groups of German subsidiaries owning our manufacturing facilities, certain manufacturing assets, real property, tangible personal property, employees, inventories, books and records, a portion of our patent portfolio, intellectual property and technology, rights under certain material contracts and authorizations necessary for GF to carry on its business. In exchange we received GF securities consisting of one Class A Ordinary Share, 1,090,950 Class A Preferred Shares and 700,000 Class B Preferred Shares, and the assumption of certain liabilities by GF. ATIC contributed $1.4 billion of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities consisting of one Class A Ordinary Share, 218,190 Class A Preferred Shares, 172,760 Class B Preferred Shares, $202 million aggregate principal amount of 4% Class A Subordinated Convertible Notes (the Class A Notes) and $807 million aggregate principal amount of 11% Class B Subordinated Convertible Notes (the Class B Notes), and transferred $700 million of cash to us in exchange for the transfer by us of 700,000 GF Class B Preferred Shares. At the Closing, we also issued to WCH, for an aggregate purchase price of $125 million, 58 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 35 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the Warrants). The Warrants are currently exercisable and expire on March 2, 2019. The shares issuable under these Warrants have been included in our basic earnings per share calculation from the third quarter of 2009 when the Warrants became exercisable. Under the Master Transaction Agreement, the cash consideration that WCH and ATIC paid and the securities that they received are as follows: • Cash paid by WCH to AMD for the purchase of 58 million shares of AMD common stock and Warrants: $125 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for the aggregate principal amount of Class A Notes, which are convertible into 201,810 Class A Preferred Shares: $202 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes, which are convertible into 807,240 Class B Preferred Shares: $807 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for 218,190 Class A Preferred Shares: $218 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for 172,760 Class B Preferred Shares: $173 million; and • Cash paid by ATIC to AMD for 700,000 Class B Preferred Shares: $700 million. As of the Closing, AMD and ATIC owned 1,090,950, or 83.3 percent, and 218,190, or 16.7 percent, respectively, of Class A Preferred Shares, and ATIC owned 100 percent of the Class B Preferred Shares and 100 percent of the Class A Notes and Class B Notes. In July 2009, ATIC contributed $260 million of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities consisting of $52 million aggregate principal amount of Class A Notes and $208 million aggregate principal amount of Class B 44 Table of Contents Notes. We declined to participate in the funding request. As of December 26, 2009, on a fully converted to Ordinary Shares basis, we owned approximately 31.6 percent of GF and ATIC owned approximately 68.4 percent of GF. In November 2009, upon the settlement of our litigation with Intel, and the execution of a patent cross-license agreement between us and Intel, a Reconciliation Event, was deemed to have occurred. Class B Preferred Shares. The Class B Preferred Shares rank senior in right of payment to all other classes or series of equity securities of GF for purposes of dividends, distributions and upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of GF (Liquidation Event). Each Class B Preferred Share is deemed to accrete in value at a rate of 12 percent per year, compounded semiannually, of the initial purchase price per such share. The accreted value accrues daily from the Closing and is taken into account upon certain distributions to the holders of Class B Preferred Shares or upon conversion of the Class B Preferred Shares. Upon a Liquidation Event, each Class B Preferred Share will be entitled to receive, prior to any distribution to the holders of any other classes or series of equity securities, an amount equal to its accreted value. Each Class B Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class B Conversion Rate. Each Class B Preferred Share will also automatically convert into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class B Conversion Rate upon the earlier of (i) an initial public offering of GF (IPO) or (ii) a change of control transaction of GF. The initial Class B Conversion Rate is 100 Class B Ordinary Shares for each Class B Preferred Share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Class B Preferred Shares currently vote on an as-converted basis with any outstanding Ordinary Shares, voting together as a single class, with respect to any question upon which holders of Ordinary Shares have the right to vote. Class A Preferred Shares. The Class A Preferred Shares rank senior in right of payment to the Ordinary Shares of GF and junior in right of payment to the Class B Preferred Shares for purposes of dividends, distributions and upon a Liquidation Event. The Class A Preferred Shares are not entitled to any dividend or pre-determined accretion in value. Upon a Liquidation Event, each Class A Preferred Share will be entitled to receive, after the distribution to the holders of the Class B Preferred Shares but prior to any distribution to the holders of Ordinary Shares, out of any remaining assets of GF, an amount equal to the initial purchase price per share of the Class A Preferred Shares. Each Class A Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder, into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class A Conversion Rate. Each Class A Preferred Share will also automatically convert into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class A Conversion Rate upon the earlier of (i) an IPO or (ii) a change of control transaction of GF. The initial Class A Conversion Rate is 100 Class B Ordinary Shares for each Class A Preferred Share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Class A Preferred Shares currently vote on an as-converted basis with any outstanding Ordinary Shares, voting together as a single class, with respect to any question upon which holders of Ordinary Shares have the right to vote. Class A Subordinated Convertible Notes. The Class A Notes accrue interest at a rate of 4 percent per annum, compounded semiannually. Interest on the Class A Notes is payable semiannually in additional Class A Notes. The Class A Notes are the unsecured obligations of GF and rank subordinated in right of payment to any current or future senior indebtedness of GF. The Class A Notes are not redeemable by GF without the note holder’s consent. The Class A Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, in multiples of $1,000, into GF Class A Preferred Shares at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date based on the conversion ratio in effect on the date of conversion. The Class A Notes mature on March 2, 2019; however they automatically convert into Class A Preferred Shares upon the earlier of (i) a GF IPO, (ii) certain change of control transactions of GF or (iii) the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. As of December 26, 2009, the aggregate principal amount of Class A Notes was $254 million. Class B Subordinated Convertible Notes. The Class B Notes accrue interest at a rate of 11 percent per annum, compounded semiannually. Interest on the Class B Notes is payable semiannually in additional Class B Notes. The Class B Notes are the unsecured obligations of GF and rank subordinated in right of payment to any 45 Table of Contents current or future senior indebtedness of GF. The Class B Notes are not redeemable by GF without the note holder’s consent. The Class B Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, in multiples of $1,000, into GF Class B Preferred Shares at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date at the conversion ratio in effect on the date of conversion. The Class B Notes mature on March 2, 2019; however they automatically convert into GF Class B Preferred Shares upon the earlier of (i) a GF IPO, (ii) certain change of control transactions of GF or (iii) the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. As of December 26, 2009, the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes was $1,015 million. AMD, ATIC and GF are also parties to a Shareholders’ Agreement, a Funding Agreement and a Wafer Supply Agreement, certain terms of each of which are summarized in Part I, Item 1—Business, above. Based on the structure of the GF transaction and the guidance on accounting for interests in variable interest entities during 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we were required to consolidate the accounts of GF from March 2, 2009 through December 26, 2009. For this period, ATIC’s noncontrolling interest, represented by its equity interests in GF, is presented outside of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet due to ATIC’s right to put those securities back to us in the event of a change of control of AMD during the two years following the Closing. Our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share consists of consolidated net income (loss), as adjusted for (i) the portion of GF’s earnings or losses attributable to ATIC, which is based on ATIC’s proportional ownership interest in GF’s Class A Preferred Shares (16.7 percent as of December 26, 2009), and (ii) the non-cash accretion on GF’s Class B Preferred Shares attributable to us, based on the proportional ownership interest of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares (83.3 percent as of December 26, 2009). On December 18, 2009, ATIC II, an affiliate of ATIC, acquired Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (Chartered). On December 28, 2009, with our consent, ATIC II, Chartered and GF entered into a Management and Operating Agreement (the MOA), which provides for the joint management and operation of GF and Chartered, thereby allowing GF and Chartered to share costs, take advantage of operating synergies and market wafer fabrication services on a collective basis. In order to allow for the signing of the MOA on December 28, 2009 prior to obtaining any required regulatory approvals, we agreed to irrevocably waive rights under the Shareholders Agreement with respect to certain matters that require unanimous GF board approval. Additionally, if any such matters come before the GF board, we agreed that our designated GF directors will vote in the same manner as the majority of ATIC-designated GF board members voting on any such matters. As a result of waiving these approval rights, as of December 28, 2009, for financial reporting purposes we no longer shared the control with ATIC over GF. In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. This new guidance became effective for us beginning the first day of fiscal 2010. Under the new guidance, the investor who is deemed to both (i) have the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the variable interest entity’s economic performance and (ii) be exposed to losses and returns, will be the primary beneficiary who should then consolidate the variable interest entity. We evaluated whether the governance changes described above would, pursuant to the new guidance, affect our consolidation of GF. We considered the purpose and design of GF, the activities of GF that most significantly affect the economic performance of GF and the concept of “who has the power,” as contemplated by the new guidance. Based on the results of this evaluation and in light of the governance changes referenced above whereby we now only have protective rights relative to the operations of GF, we concluded that ATIC is the party who has the power to direct the activities of GF that most significantly impact GF’s performance and is, therefore, the primary beneficiary of GF. Accordingly, beginning fiscal 2010, we will deconsolidate GF and account for GF under the equity method of accounting. We will continue applying the equity method of accounting until we are deemed to no longer have the ability to significantly influence the operations of GF. 46 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near-term factory production planning. Generally, inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand for the next six months are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present. We perform the annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. Implied fair value of goodwill is determined by considering both the income and market approach. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units, discounted using estimated discount rates. The key assumptions we use to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13 percent to 32 percent. Discount rates are based on our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the risks associated with operations. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any. 47 Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets including Acquired Intangible Assets. We consider quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we test for recoverability of the asset by determining whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. Significant judgment is involved in estimating future cash flows and deriving the discount rate, which ranges from 18 percent to 30 percent, to apply to the estimated future cash flows, and in evaluating the results of appraisals or other valuation methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results which also reduces the carrying basis of the related asset. The new carrying value of the related asset is depreciated or amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We also must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful life of the asset. We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. For assets held for sale, impairment losses are measured at the lower of the carrying amount of the assets or the fair value of the assets less costs to sell. For assets to be disposed of other than by sale, impairment losses are measured as their carrying amount less salvage value, if any, at the time the assets cease to be used. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. Results of Operations We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. We review and assess operating performance using segment net revenues and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net, equity in net income (loss) of investees and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. From the first quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2008, in conjunction with the integration of ATI’s operations into ours, we began reviewing and addressing operating performance using the following three reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which included microprocessors, chipsets and embedded processors and related revenue; 48 Table of Contents • the Graphics segment, which included graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue; and • the Consumer Electronics segment, which included products used in handheld devices, digital televisions and other consumer electronics products, as well as revenue from royalties received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. In the second quarter of 2008, we decided to divest our Handheld and Digital Television business units, which were previously part of the Consumer Electronics segment. As a result, we classified these business units as discontinued operations in our financial statements and began reviewing and assessing operating performance using the following reportable operating segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which included microprocessors, chipsets and embedded processors and related revenue; and • the Graphics segment, which included graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue as well as revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that, based on ongoing negotiations related to the divestiture of the Handheld business unit, the discontinued operations classification criteria for this business unit were no longer met. As a result we classified the results of the Handheld business unit back into continuing operations. In the first quarter of 2009, as a result of the formation of GF, we began reviewing and assessing operating performance using the following reportable operating segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which includes microprocessors, chipsets and embedded processors and related revenue; • the Graphics segment, which includes graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue as well as revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology; and • the Foundry segment, which includes operating results attributable to front end wafer manufacturing operations and related activities, including the operating results of GF, from March 2, 2009 to December 26, 2009. In addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments because we do not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the operating segments. Such expenses are non-Foundry segment related expenses and include employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets. The income we recognized from our settlement agreement with Intel and the results of the Handheld business unit, which consist of revenue from sales of AMD Imageon media processors and other handheld products, are also reported in the All Other category. Starting in the first quarter of 2009, we also have an Intersegment Eliminations category, which is also not a reportable segment. This category includes intersegment eliminations for revenue, cost of sales and profits on inventory related to transactions between the Computing Solutions segment and the Foundry segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we will no longer report the Foundry segment and Intersegment Eliminations category due to the deconsolidation of GF. We use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 each included 52 weeks. References in this report to 2009, 2008 and 2007 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. 49 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for 2009, 2008 and 2007. Information specific to the Foundry segment and Intersegment Eliminations for periods prior to 2009 have not been recast to reflect the segment changes noted above because it is not practicable to do so. Accordingly, 2009 information is not comparable to prior period information. 2009 2008 2007 (In Millions) Net revenue: Computing Solutions $ 4,131 $ 4,559 $ 4,702 Graphics 1,206 1,165 992 Foundry 1,101 — — All Other 66 84 164 Intersegment Eliminations (1,101 ) — — Total net revenue $ 5,403 $ 5,808 $ 5,858 Operating income (loss): Computing Solutions $ 127 $ (461 ) $ (712 ) Graphics 50 12 (39 ) Foundry (433 ) — — All Other 968 (1,506 ) (1,559 ) Intersegment Eliminations (48 ) — — Total operating income (loss) 664 (1,955 ) (2,310 ) Interest income 16 39 73 Interest expense (438 ) (391 ) (382 ) Other income (expense), net 166 (37 ) (118 ) Equity in net income (loss) of investees — — (44 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 408 $ (2,344 ) $ (2,781 ) Computing Solutions Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.1 billion in 2009 decreased 9 percent compared to net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2008. In 2008, Computing Solutions net revenue included $191 million in revenue from the licensing of certain manufacturing process technology to a third party, which accounted for 4 percent of this total. Without the effect of the process technology license revenue, Computing Solutions net revenue would have decreased 5 percent primarily as a result of a 16 percent decrease in the average selling price partially offset by a 13 percent increase in unit shipments. The average selling price decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price of microprocessors, especially for notebook PCs, and a greater mix of chipsets, which typically have a lower average selling price. Competitive market conditions and the macroeconomic challenges that affected the global economy, especially in the first half of 2009, caused us to decrease the price of many of our Computing Solutions products, and also contributed to a shift in our product mix to lower end microprocessors. The increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for chipsets and microprocessors for notebooks. Chipset unit shipments increased, especially in the second half of 2009, as customers increasingly adopted AMD chipsets with our microprocessor products. Unit shipments of our microprocessors for notebooks increased, especially in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to increased demand in the overall notebook PC market, as end users increasingly demanded notebook PCs over desktop PCs. Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2008 decreased 3 percent compared to net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2007. In 2008, Computing Solutions net revenue included $191 million from the licensing of manufacturing process technology Without the effect of the process technology license revenue, Computing Solutions net revenue would have decreased by $334 million or 7 percent compared to 2007 due to a 4 percent decrease in the average selling price and a 3 percent decrease in unit shipments of our Computing Solutions products. The decrease in the average selling price was primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price 50 Table of Contents for both our microprocessors and chipset products. Although our microprocessor product mix improved, the average selling price for our microprocessors decreased due to competitive market conditions. The average selling price for our chipsets decreased due to competitive pricing pressure and an unfavorable shift in our product mix toward older generation chipsets. Unit shipments decreased due to decreased shipments of our microprocessors as a result of significantly lower end-user demand in the fourth quarter of 2008, which resulted in our customers reducing or cancelling orders for our products in order to bring their inventory levels into balance to address end-user demand and the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Computing Solutions operating income was $127 million in 2009 compared to an operating loss of $461 million in 2008. Operating results for 2009 are not comparable to operating results for 2008 because of the creation of the Foundry segment in the first quarter of 2009, which resulted in our reporting certain research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses in the Foundry segment that we would previously have reported in the Computing Solutions segment. Operating loss in 2008 included a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment and $191 million of process technology license revenue that did not occur in 2009. Computing Solutions operating loss was $461 million in 2008 compared to an operating loss of $712 million in 2007. The reduction in operating loss was due to the recognition of the $191 million of process technology license revenue referenced above, a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment that did not occur in 2007, a $168 million decrease in cost of sales, and a $97 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses partially offset by a $63 million increase in research and development expenses. Cost of sales decreased due to lower microprocessor unit volume and manufacturing cost reductions in 2008. The lower costs were partially offset by a $214 million incremental write-down of inventory related to Computing Solutions products in the fourth quarter of 2008. Research and development expenses increased and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. Graphics Graphics net revenue of $1.21 billion in 2009 increased 3 percent compared to net revenue of $1.17 billion in 2008. The increase was due to a 5 percent increase in revenue from the sale of GPU products partially offset by a 3 percent decrease in royalty revenue received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. Revenue from the sale of GPU products increased due to an increase in GPU unit shipments partially offset by a decrease in GPU average selling price. GPU unit shipments increased primarily due to an increase in demand for our graphics products, especially our 40 nm ATI Radeon HD 5000 series of products, which we introduced in September 2009. We believe that the increase in GPU unit shipments was limited as a result of supply constraints with respect to our next generation GPUs. GPU average selling price decreased due to competitive pricing pressure and a shift in our product mix to more value-priced GPUs. However, the decline in GPU average selling price that we experienced during the first three quarters of 2009 was mitigated by improved GPU average selling price in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to sales of our higher priced ATI Radeon HD 5000 series of products. Royalty revenue decreased primarily due to decreased demand for the latest generation of game consoles in light of the macroeconomic environment in the first half of 2009. Graphics net revenue of $1.17 billion in 2008 increased 17 percent compared to 2007 revenue of $992 million. The increase was primarily due to a 12 percent increase in revenue from sales of GPU products and a 76 percent increase in royalty revenue from the sales of game consoles that incorporate our graphics technology. Revenue from the sales of GPU products increased due to an increase in unit shipments of GPUs while the GPU average selling price was approximately flat. GPU unit shipments increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to demand for new products, including the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of products which we introduced in June 2008. Although unit shipments increased in 2008 compared to 2007, we saw a significant decline in unit shipments in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the weak macroeconomic environment and resulting decrease in demand. Royalty revenue increased due to increased demand for the latest generation of game consoles. 51 Table of Contents Graphics operating income was $50 million in 2009 compared to operating income of $12 million 2008. The increase in operating results was primarily due to a $41 million increase in net revenue described above and a $29 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses due to a reduction in discretionary spending. These decreases were partially offset by a $29 million increase in cost of sales because of higher GPU unit shipments. Graphics operating income in 2008 was $12 million compared to an operating loss of $39 million in 2007. The $51 million operating improvement was due to the increase in revenue referenced above. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $77 million increase in cost of sales because of higher GPU unit shipments and increased research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses, which increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. Foundry Foundry net revenue was $1.1 billion in 2009. Foundry operating loss was $433 million in 2009. Prior to the first quarter of 2009, we did not have a Foundry segment and, therefore, the results of operations in 2009 for the Foundry segment are not comparable to 2008. All Other All Other net revenue of $66 million in 2009 decreased 21 percent compared to $84 million in 2008. All Other net revenue decreased because we no longer develop new Handheld products, and we experienced reduced customer orders in 2009. All Other net revenue of $84 million in 2008 decreased by $80 million or 49 percent compared to net revenue of $164 million in 2007 mainly due to decreased demand from one of the major customers of our Handheld products. All Other operating income of $968 million in 2009 increased by $2.5 billion compared to an operating loss of $1.5 billion in 2008. The improvement in operating results was primarily attributable to $1,242 million of income from the settlement of our litigation with Intel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Additionally, in 2008, we had a $1.1 billion impairment charge, which included a goodwill write-down of $1.0 billion and a write-down of specific intangible assets of $130 million. There were no corresponding charges in 2009. The improvement was also impacted by a $67 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets due to the write-down of certain intangible assets in 2008 and a $25 million decrease in restructuring charges. All Other operating loss of $1.5 billion in 2008 decreased by $53 million compared to an operating loss of $1.6 billion in 2007. The decrease in the operating loss was primarily attributable to a $124 million decrease in ATI acquisition-related charges and a $43 million decrease in impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets, partially offset by $90 million in restructuring charges and $23 million of expenses in connection with the formation of GF in 2008. ATI acquisition-related charges decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a decrease in amortization expense of acquired intangible assets of $72 million, an $89 million decrease in the write down of acquisition-related intangible assets in 2008, a decrease of $27 million in integration charges, and the absence of a $25 million charge related to the cost of fair value adjustment of acquired inventory. Intersegment Eliminations Intersegment eliminations represent eliminations during consolidation in revenue and in cost of sales and profits on inventory between the Computing Solutions segment and the Foundry segment. For 2009, intersegment eliminations of revenue were $1.1 billion and intersegment eliminations of cost of sales and profits on inventory were $48 million. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we will no longer have intersegment eliminations due to the deconsolidation of GF. 52 Table of Contents Comparison of Gross Margin, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net, Income Taxes and Other Expenses The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2009, 2008 and 2007. 2009 2008 2007 (In millions except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 3,131 $ 3,488 $ 3,669 Gross margin 2,272 2,320 2,189 Gross margin percentage 42 % 40 % 37 % Research and development $ 1,721 $ 1,848 $ 1,771 Marketing, general and administrative 994 1,304 1,360 Legal settlement (1,242 ) — — Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges 70 137 236 Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets — 1,089 1,132 Restructuring charges 65 90 — Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment — (193 ) — Interest income 16 39 73 Interest expense (438 ) (391 ) (382 ) Other income (expense), net 166 (37 ) (118 ) Equity in net loss of investees — — (44 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 112 68 27 Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 42 percent in 2009, a 2 percentage point increase compared to 40 percent in 2008. Gross margin in 2009 included a $171 million, or 3 percent, benefit related to the sale of inventory that had been written-down in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margin in 2008 included a $191 million, or 2 percent, benefit from process technology license revenue recorded in our Computing Solutions segment and a $227 million, or 4 percent, negative impact from an incremental write-down of inventory. Without the effect of the above events in 2009 and 2008, which we believe gives a more comparable view, gross margin would have been 39 percent in 2009 compared to 42 percent in 2008. Gross margin in the first half of 2009 was adversely impacted by depressed average selling price and the under-utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for our microprocessor products. However, the adverse impact of these factors on 2009 gross margin was partially mitigated by developments during the second half of 2009, including improvements in utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities and an improvement in our unit costs primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of microprocessors manufactured using 45 nm process technology. Gross margin as a percent of net revenue increased to 40 percent in 2008 compared to 37 percent in 2007. However, gross margin in 2008 was impacted by the following two events: the $191 million process technology license revenue recorded in our Computing Solutions segment favorably impacted gross margin in 2008 by 2 percentage points while the $227 million incremental write-down of inventory negatively impacted gross margin in 2008 by 4 percentage points. Without the effect of these items, gross margin would have been 42 percent in 2008 compared to 37 percent in 2007. This improvement in gross margin was primarily due to an improvement in fab utilization and reductions in manufacturing costs. Gross margin in 2008 was also favorably impacted by 1 percentage point due to the 76 percent increase in royalty revenue in connection with the sale of game consoles that incorporate our graphics technology. Although we experienced a richer product mix in 2008 compared to 2007, competitive pricing pressures mitigated any significant benefits to gross margin. We record the grants and allowances that GF receives from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for their Dresden facilities as long-term liabilities on our consolidated financial statements. We amortize these amounts as they are earned as a reduction to operating expenses. The amortization of the production related grants and allowances is recorded as a credit to cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled 53 Table of Contents $46 million in 2009, $86 million in 2008 and $138 million in 2007. The fluctuations in the recognition of these credits have not significantly impacted our consolidated gross margins. With the deconsolidation of GF, our future consolidated financial statements will no longer directly reflect such credits to cost of sales. However, these credits will have a favorable impact on the amounts that we pay GF pursuant to the Wafer Supply Agreement. Pursuant to Wafer Supply Agreement between AMD and GF, we agreed to compensate GF on a cost-plus basis, which results in increased per unit manufacturing costs for AMD compared to manufacturing wafers in-house. Although this cost-plus arrangement has not impacted our consolidated financial statements while we were consolidating the financial results of GF, as of the first quarter of 2010, we will no longer consolidate the financial results of GF, and this cost-plus arrangement will have a negative impact on our reported gross margins. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased $127 million, or 7 percent, from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $1.7 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $193 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, which reflected our efforts to reduce operating expenses, and was partially offset by a $62 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses mainly incurred by GF. As a result of the deconsolidation of GF, we expect that our future research and development expenses will decrease. Research and development expenses increased $77 million, or 4 percent, from $1,771 million in 2007 to $1,848 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a $63 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to the Computing Solutions segment and a $9 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to the Graphics segment. Research and development expenses for the Computing Solutions segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs for our next generation microprocessor products and start-up costs for our former manufacturing facility, Fab 38. Research and development expenses for the Graphics segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs. From time to time, GF applies for subsidies relating to certain research and development projects. We recorded these research and development subsidies in our consolidated financial statements as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy allowance are met. The credit to research and development expenses was $46 million in 2009, $36 million in 2008 and $30 million in 2007. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased $310 million or 24 percent, from $1.3 billion in 2008 to $994 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $216 million decrease in cooperative advertising programs due to decreased sales and cost reduction activities, a $99 million decrease in corporate sales and marketing expenses due to our cost cutting efforts and a $16 million decrease in other administrative expenses. On November 12, 2009, Intel and AMD entered into an agreement to end all outstanding legal disputes between the companies including antitrust litigation and patent cross license disputes. As a result of this agreement, we expect that our legal expenses will decrease in 2010. In addition, as a result of the deconsolidation of GF, we expect that our future marketing, general and administrative expenses will decrease. Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased $56 million, or 4 percent, from $1.4 billion in 2007 to $1.3 billion in 2008. This decrease was primarily due to a $97 million decrease in corporate marketing and branding expenses for our Computing Solutions segment and a $25 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, which decreased for the reasons set forth under “Stock-Based Compensation Expense,” below. These decreases were partially offset by a $33 million increase in marketing, general and administrative 54 Table of Contents expenses for the Graphics segment and $23 million of expenses in connection with the formation of GF. Graphics’ marketing, general and administrative expenses increased due to higher marketing and cooperative advertising costs related to the launch of new products. Legal Settlement On November 12, 2009, we entered into an agreement with Intel to end all outstanding legal disputes between the companies including antitrust litigation and patent cross license disputes. Under the terms of the agreement: • AMD and Intel agreed to a new 5-year patent cross license agreement that gives AMD broad rights and the freedom to operate a business utilizing multiple foundries; • Intel and AMD waived all claims of breach from the previous license agreement; • Intel paid us $1.25 billion; • Intel agreed to abide by a set of business practice provisions going forward; • We dropped all pending litigation, including the case in U.S. District Court in Delaware and two cases pending in Japan; and • We withdrew all of our regulatory complaints worldwide; This settlement encompasses all antitrust litigation and disputes and there are no future obligations that we need to perform to earn this settlement payment. That is, the patent cross license agreement represents fully paid up licenses by both AMD and Intel for which no future payments or delivery is required. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our fiscal 2009 operating results. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets and Integration Charges, and Impairment of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets and Integrations Charges Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges decreased $67 million, or 49 percent, from $137 million in 2008 to $70 million in 2009. This decrease was due to the write-down of certain acquired intangible assets as a result of the 2008 impairment analyses. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges decreased $99 million, or 42 percent, from $236 million in 2007 to $137 million in 2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $27 million decrease in charges related to the integration of AMD and ATI operations and a $72 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets due to the write-down of certain acquired intangible assets as a result of the impairment analyses. Impairment of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets 2009 Impairment Analysis In the fourth quarter of 2009 we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill. We considered the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. The income approach required estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 16 percent to 18 percent. Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill, the fair values exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units by a significant amount (Step 1), indicating that there was no goodwill impairment. As of December 26, 2009 we did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Our cost basis of goodwill deductible for tax was $2.6 billion. Our adjusted basis after tax deductions through 2009 is $1.7 billion. 55 Table of Contents 2008 Impairment In the second quarter of 2008, we evaluated the viability of our non-core businesses and determined that our Handheld and Digital Television business units were not directly aligned with our core strategy of computing and graphics market opportunities. Therefore, we decided to divest these units and classify them as discontinued operations in our financial statements. As a result, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill associated with our Handheld and Digital Television business units were impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge of $799 million, of which $336 million related to the Handheld business unit is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” and $463 million related to the Digital Television business unit is included in the caption, “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charges were determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting units with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. We chose the same approach that we used during the 2007 impairment analysis, which required estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 18 percent to 32 percent. The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from an updated long-term financial forecast, which was revised as a result of the challenging economic environment. The decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and resulting impairment charge was primarily driven by the estimated proceeds from the expected divestiture of these business units. The outcome of our goodwill impairment analysis indicated that the carrying amount of certain of our Handheld and Digital Television business unit acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups may not have been recoverable. We determined that the carrying amounts of certain acquisition-related intangible assets associated with our Handheld and Digital Television business units exceeded their estimated fair values, and we recorded an impairment charge of $77 million, of which $67 million related to the Handheld business unit and is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” and $10 million related to the Digital Television unit and is included in the caption, “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that, based on our ongoing negotiations related to the divestiture of the Handheld business unit, the discontinued operations classification criteria for this business unit were no longer met. As a result we classified the results of the Handheld business back into continuing operations. During the first quarter of 2009 we sold certain graphics and multimedia technology assets and intellectual property that were formerly part of our Handheld business unit to Qualcomm. As of December 27, 2008, these assets were classified as assets held for sale and included in the caption, “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” in our 2008 consolidated balance sheet. Pursuant to our agreement with Qualcomm, we retained the AMD Imageon media processor brand and the right to continue selling the products that were part of the Handheld business unit. We intend to support our existing Handheld products and customers through the current product lifecycles. We do not intend to develop any new Handheld products or engage new customer programs beyond those already committed. The lives of the remaining certain intangible assets associated with the Handheld business unit have been shortened to reflect our current expectations of their economic usefulness. In the fourth quarter of 2008, pursuant to our accounting policy, we conducted an annual impairment test of goodwill. In addition, due to the significant decline in the price of our common stock and the revised lower revenue forecast for the fourth quarter of 2008, which we concluded were additional impairment indicators, we conducted another interim impairment analysis as of November 22, 2008, the end of our second fiscal month of the fourth quarter. As a result of these analyses, we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill included in the Graphics and Computing Solutions segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of $622 million, which is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting units within these segments as of November 22, 2008 with 56 Table of Contents the implied fair value of the goodwill. We considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. Also, we chose the same approach that we used during the 2007 impairment analysis, which required estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 19 percent to 25 percent. The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from an updated long-term financial outlook in light of fourth quarter market conditions and the challenging economic outlook. The conclusion was also due to the deterioration in the price of our common stock and the resulting reduced market capitalization. The outcome of our 2008 goodwill impairment analysis indicated that the carrying amount of certain acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. We assessed the recoverability of the acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups, as appropriate, by determining whether the unamortized balances could be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows. We determined that certain of the acquisition-related intangible assets associated with our Computing Solutions and Graphics segments and our Handheld business unit were impaired primarily due to the revised lower revenue forecasts associated with the products incorporating the developed product technology, the customer relationships, and the trademarks and trade names. We measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were based on projected discounted future net cash flows. As a result of this impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $62 million, which is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. 2007 Impairment In the fourth quarter of 2007, pursuant to our accounting policy, we performed an annual impairment test of goodwill. As a result of this analysis, we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill included in our Graphics and former Consumer Electronics segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.26 billion, of which $913 million is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” and $346 million is included in the caption “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in our 2007 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting units within these segments as of October 1, 2007, with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. While market valuation data for comparable companies was gathered and analyzed, we concluded that there was not sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach, and therefore we ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units, discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 13 percent to 15 percent. The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from an updated long-term financial forecast, which was developed as part of our strategic planning cycle conducted annually during the latter part of the third quarter of 2007. The decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and resulting impairment charge was primarily driven by the updated long-term financial forecasts, which showed lower estimated near-term and longer-term profitability compared to estimates developed at the time of the completion of the ATI acquisition. The updated financial forecast for our Graphics segment was lower primarily because of intense pricing competition with Nvidia throughout 2007, which required an increase in sales and marketing activities to a greater extent than we previously forecasted. In addition, we had invested in the development of new graphics technologies to a greater extent than previously forecasted, which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses. Also, Intel announced its intention to develop a discrete graphics product. These factors resulted in lower near-term and longer-term forecasts of Graphics business revenues, operating profitability and cash flows compared to the forecasts at the time of the ATI acquisition. The updated financial forecast for our former Consumer Electronics segment was lower primarily because our Digital Television business was affected by the rapid introduction and proliferation of low cost digital 57 Table of Contents televisions that did not contain our technology. The availability and adoption of these low cost alternatives by consumers resulted in lower forecasted sales to those companies employing our technology. In addition, our Handheld business was dependant on a small number of mobile handset customers for its revenues. During 2007, one handset customer experienced severe competition and eroding market share for its consumer handset products. These two principal factors resulted in lower near-term and longer-term forecasts of revenues, operating profitability, and cash flows compared to our forecast at the time of the ATI acquisition. These updated long-term financial forecasts represented the best estimate that we had at the time, and we believe that the underlying assumptions were reasonable at that time. The outcome of our 2007 goodwill impairment analysis indicated that the carrying amount of certain acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. We assessed the recoverability of the acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups, as appropriate, by determining whether the unamortized balances could be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows. We determined that certain of the acquisition related developed product technology associated with our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments was impaired primarily due to the revised lower revenue forecasts associated with the products incorporating such developed product technology. We measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were based on projected discounted future net cash flows. As a result of this impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $349 million, of which $219 million is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” and $130 million is included in the caption “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in our 2007 consolidated statement of operations. Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment and the license of related process technology During 2008, in conjunction with the conversion of Fab 30, our former manufacturing facility in Dresden, Germany, from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter fabrication, we sold certain 200 millimeter manufacturing equipment and licensed certain process technology to a third party. We evaluated this multiple-element arrangement and determined that each component was considered a separate unit of accounting. In addition, the transaction consideration was allocated to each unit based on their relative fair values. Upon delivery of a majority of the manufacturing equipment to the applicable third party, we recognized a gain of approximately $167 million, which is classified in the caption “Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. The difference between the $167 million gain recognized in the transaction described above and the $193 million gain shown in the consolidated statement of operations for 2008 represents gains recognized on sales of 200 millimeter equipment to other third parties. In addition, we deferred recognizing approximately $49 million of payments received pending the future delivery of the remaining manufacturing equipment. Upon delivery of the process technology, we recognized revenue of approximately $191 million, which is included under the caption “Net revenue” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. During 2009, there was no activity related to the sale of 200 millimeter equipment, and the deferred gain of $47 million is classified under the caption “Other long-term liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets. Effects of Restructuring Plans In the second and fourth quarters of 2008, we initiated restructuring plans (the 2008 Restructuring Plans) to reduce our cost structure. Both plans primarily involved the termination of employees. The restructuring charges recorded in conjunction with the plan initiated during the second quarter of 2008 primarily represented severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits and costs to terminate a contract. This plan was completed during the third quarter of 2009. 58 Table of Contents The restructuring charges recorded in conjunction with the plan initiated during the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily represented severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, contract or program termination costs, asset impairments and exit costs for facility consolidations and closures. The remaining liability for this plan is primarily related to lease obligations that will be paid through 2012. We anticipate cash payments related to this liability to be $19 million in 2010, $2 million in 2011 and $2 million in 2012. We expect this plan to be substantially completed in the first half of 2010. Restructuring charges for the 2008 Restructuring Plans have been aggregated and are included in the caption “Restructuring charges” in our consolidated statement of operations, with the exception of $1 million in 2008, which is classified as discontinued operations. The following table provides a summary of each major type of cost associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plans through December 26, 2009: December 26,2009 December 27,2008 Total (In millions) Severance and benefits $ 25 $ 53 $ 78 Contract or program terminations 12 13 25 Asset impairments 8 18 26 Facility consolidations and closures 15 6 21 Total $ 60 $ 90 $ 150 The following table provides a roll forward of the liability associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plans: Severance and related benefits Other exit-related costs (in millions) Balance December 27, 2008 $ 18 $ 9 Net charges 25 27 Cash payments (37 ) (19 ) Balance December 26, 2009 $ 6 $ 17 In December 2002, we initiated a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to align the cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry-wide excess inventory. The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at the Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. With respect to our Sunnyvale, California site, we entered into a sublease agreement for a portion of these facilities with Spansion Inc. On March 1, 2009, Spansion Inc. filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On March 31, 2009, Spansion Inc. filed a motion in that proceeding in which it indicated that it does not intend to perform its obligations under its sublease agreement with us. As a result of this and our ongoing assessment of the restructuring accrual, we recorded an additional charge of approximately $5 million in the first quarter of 2009, which is included in the caption “Restructuring charges” in our consolidated statement of operations. These amounts will be paid through 2011. The following table provides a roll forward of the liability associated with the 2002 Restructuring Plan: Lease Obligations (In millions) Balance December 27, 2008 $ 32 Charges 5 Cash payments (17 ) Balance December 26, 2009 $ 20 59 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income of $16 million in 2009 decreased from $39 million in 2008 primarily due to a 66 percent decrease in weighted-average interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 partially offset by an increase in average cash balances during 2009. Interest income of $39 million in 2008 decreased from $73 million in 2007, primarily due to a 39 percent decrease in weighted-average interest rates and lower average cash balances during 2008 compared to 2007. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Total interest charges $ 439 $ 400 $ 405 Less: interest capitalized (1 ) (9 ) (23 ) Interest expense $ 438 $ 391 $ 382 Total interest charges of $439 million in 2009 increased by $39 million from $400 million in 2008 primarily due to GF’s issuance of Class A Notes and Class B Notes to ATIC on March 2, 2009. These notes resulted in $92 million of interest expense in 2009. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of interest expense due to a lower principal amount outstanding under the 700 million euro Term Loan Facility Agreement among AMD Fab 36 KG and a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG (Fab 36 Term Loan) and our 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes) due to repurchases occurring in the second and third quarters of 2009. There was $1 million of interest capitalization in 2009 related to GF’s construction of Fab 2, its semiconductor facility in Saratoga County, New York. Total interest charges of $400 million in 2008 decreased by $5 million from $405 million in 2007 primarily due to a lower outstanding aggregate debt balance in 2008 compared to 2007. During 2008, we repaid $134 million of the principal amount outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan and repurchased $63 million of silent partnership contributions (which we classified as debt) from the unaffiliated partners of AMD Fab 36 KG. In addition, we did not incur any interest pursuant to our Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc., dated October 24, 2006 (October 2006 Term Loan) in 2008 whereas in 2007 we incurred interest through August 2007. These factors were partially offset by the increased interest incurred on our 6.00% Notes and 5.75% Notes, which were outstanding for all of 2008 but only for a portion of 2007. Capitalized interest expense of $9 million in 2008 decreased by $14 million from $23 million in 2007. Capitalized interest expense decreased by an aggregate of $17 million from 2007 to 2008 because we discontinued capitalizing interest for Fab 36 in the first quarter of 2008 when it was in full production and we discontinued capitalizing interest for our campus in Austin, Texas in the fourth quarter of 2007 upon completion of construction. This was partially offset by a $3 million increase in capitalized interest expense related to the conversion of the Fab 38 facility in Dresden, Germany. In the first quarter of 2009 we retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance for certain convertible debt (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). This new guidance requires issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This adoption impacted our accounting for our 6.00% Notes whereby the equity component was included in the capital in excess of par value portion of stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet and the value of the equity component was treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component. Higher interest expense resulted by recognizing accretion of the discounted carrying value of the 6.00% Notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of the 6.00% Notes. Because the guidance required retrospective adoption, interest expense reported in the accompanying 60 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements for 2007 and 2008 is $15 million and $25 million higher than previously reported. Interest expense for 2009 under the new guidance is $25 million higher than it would have been under the previous guidance. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income, net in 2009 was $166 million compared to other expense, net of $37 million in 2008. In 2009, we repurchased $344 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for approximately $161 million in cash, resulting in a gain of approximately $174 million, and we repurchased $1,015 million principal amount of our 5.75% Notes for approximately $1,002 million in cash, resulting in a gain of approximately $6 million. In addition, we recognized a gain of $15 million on settlement of a liability related to certain foreign currency exchange contracts, a gain of $28 million on the sale of certain Handheld assets, and a $25 million gain from a class action legal settlement with DRAM manufacturers related to DRAM pricing. These gains were partially offset by a $17 million charge for real estate transfer taxes in connection with the GF manufacturing joint venture transaction, a $10 million charge related to the AMTC joint venture (described in more detail in the section “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements,” below), and a $27 million foreign exchange loss due to the unfavorable foreign exchange impact primarily on the euro denominated liabilities for our Foundry segment. During 2009, we also redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 (7.75% Notes) resulting in a net loss of $11 million. During 2009, we also recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of $3 million relating to our investment in Spansion Inc., reducing the carrying value to zero. In 2008 we recorded a $53 million other than temporary impairment charge related to our investment in Spansion Inc., and a $24 million other than temporary impairment charge related to our portfolio of ARS. These charges were partially offset by a $33 million gain related to the repurchase of $60 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for approximately $20 million in cash and a gain of $11 million on acquiring the put option related to our holdings of UBS ARS, representing the fair value of this financial instrument. Other expense, net in 2008 was $37 million compared to other expense, net of $118 million in 2007. During 2008, we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of $53 million related to our investment in Spansion Inc. and a $24 million other than temporary impairment charge related to our portfolio of ARS These losses were partially offset by a gain of $33 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the repurchase of $60 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $20 million in cash. In addition, we recognized a gain of $11 million on acquiring the put option related to our holdings of UBS ARS, representing the fair value of this financial instrument. In 2007, we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of $111 million related to our investment in Spansion Inc. and a charge of $22 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred in connection with our repayment of the October 2006 Term Loan. These charges were partially offset by a gain of $19 million on the sale of vacant land in Sunnyvale, California. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $112 million in 2009, $68 million in 2008 and $27 million in 2007. The income tax provision in 2009 was primarily due to a one-time loss of deferred tax assets for German net operating loss carryovers upon transfer of our ownership interests in the Dresden subsidiaries to GF plus foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by discrete tax benefits including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits. The income tax provision in 2008 primarily resulted from increases in net deferred tax liabilities in our former German subsidiaries reduced by net current tax benefits in other jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2007 primarily resulted from current foreign taxes reduced by the reversal of deferred U.S. taxes related to indefinite-lived goodwill, resulting from the goodwill impairment charge we recorded during the year, and recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for tax holidays. We were able to apply the special deduction provisions of IRC section 186 to the $1.25 billion payment received from the settlement of our litigation with Intel in November 2009. IRC section 186 allows prior year net operating losses to be taken as a special deduction in the current year. 61 Table of Contents As of December 26, 2009 substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets other than German deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continue to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 26, 2009, in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 as well as employee stock purchases pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the year ended December 29, 2007 was allocated in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 3 $ 10 $ 11 Research and development 40 44 50 Marketing, general and administrative 32 23 48 Total stock-based compensation expense 75 77 109 Tax benefit — — — Stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 75 $ 77 $ 109 Stock-based compensation expenses of $75 million in 2009 decreased $2 million compared to $77 million in 2008. This decrease was primarily a result of: (i) a cumulative catch up adjustment of expenses to reflect the effect of applying a higher forfeiture rate retrospectively in 2009, (ii) lower average grant date fair value 2009 as compared to 2008, and (iii) the forfeiture of certain stock option and RSU grants from employees transferring to GF. The decreases were substantially offset by the charges associated with the accelerated vesting of stock awards upon the retirement of our former Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board in 2009. Stock-based compensation expense of $77 million in 2008 decreased $32 million compared to $109 million in 2007 primarily due to the suspension of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan in late 2007, which resulted in no corresponding charges in 2008, the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expenses related to certain performance based restricted stock unit grants because we concluded that the performance criteria were no longer achievable and a net decrease in overall stock-based compensation expense as a result of the lower average grant date fair value in 2008 as compared to 2007. For the year ended December 26, 2009, we did not have employee stock-based compensation expense for discontinued operations. For the year ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, employee stock-based compensation expense included in discontinued operations and excluded from continuing operations was $2 million and $3 million, respectively. As of December 26, 2009, we had $28 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.49 years. Also, as of December 26, 2009, we had $74 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 2.34 years. In June 2009, we launched a tender offer to exchange certain outstanding stock options with an exercise price greater than $6.34 per share, a grant date on or before June 28, 2008 and an expiration date after July 27, 2010, held by eligible employees for replacement options to be granted under our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the Option Exchange). The Option Exchange expired on July 27, 2009. As a result, employees tendered options 62 Table of Contents to purchase 14.6 million shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $14.70 per share, and we cancelled and replaced those options on July 27, 2009 with options to purchase 4 million shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3.80 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on July 27, 2009. The Option Exchange resulted in an incremental stock-based compensation charge of approximately $1 million. This incremental charge along with unamortized stock-based compensation expenses associated with the cancelled options are being recognized over the new vesting periods of the replacement options which range from one to two years. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 87 percent in 2009 and 88 percent in 2008 and 2007. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity As of December 26, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $2.7 billion, which included $904 million of GF’s cash and cash equivalents. Taking into account the 2010 deconsolidation of GF, we believe that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 26, 2009, anticipated cash flow from operations and available external financing will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures of approximately $160 million over the next twelve months related to, among other things, IT, our assembly and test facilities and investments supporting research and development efforts, including AMD Fusion product development. In addition, our debt and capital lease obligations as of December 26, 2009 were $4.7 billion, of which $2.0 billion represented GF obligations. In 2009, without taking into account GF’s indebtedness, we reduced our debt by approximately $1.2 billion. We believe that in the event additional funding is required, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, we cannot assure that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Over the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. However, recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging, with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies continuing into 2010. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession, the availability and cost of credit, and the global housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies. These conditions, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels. As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers. This may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. 63 Table of Contents While economic conditions have improved, there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future. If market conditions do not continue to improve or deteriorate, it may limit our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, on favorable terms or at all, resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. Auction Rate Securities The ongoing uncertainties in the credit markets continue to affect all of our auction rate securities (ARS) and auctions for these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. While these securities are currently illiquid, there have been no defaults and we have received all interest payments as they became due. As of December 26, 2009, the par value of all our ARS was $165 million with an estimated fair value of $159 million. We have had redemptions, at par, totaling $19 million and $26 million, during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total ARS, at fair value, represented 6 percent of our total investment portfolio as of December 26, 2009. In October 2008, UBS AG (UBS) offered to repurchase all of the ARS that we purchased from them prior to February 13, 2008. We accepted this offer. From June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell, at par, these ARS to UBS. As of December 26, 2009, we owned $69 million par value with an estimated fair value of $67 million of these securities, classified in marketable securities. We classified the amounts related to our UBS ARS holdings as current assets. As of December 26, 2009, we classified our non-UBS student loan ARS holdings as non-current assets because there have been limited redemptions since the failures began. These ARS had a fair value of $58 million at December 26, 2009. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $473 million in 2009, which includes $1.25 billion from the settlement of our litigation with Intel. Net income of $293 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $121 million of interest expense primarily related to GF’s Class A Notes and Class B Notes and our 6.00% Notes, $75 million of stock-based compensation expense, $28 million net loss from the sale and disposal of property, plant and equipment and $11 million net loss primarily related to the redemption of all of our 7.75% Notes. These charges were offset by a net gain of $180 million related to our repurchase of an aggregate of $344 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $161 million in cash and $1,015 million principal amount of our 5.75% Notes for $1,002 million in cash, amortization of foreign grants and allowances of $110 million and a gain of $28 million from the sale of certain Handheld assets. The net changes in operating assets at December 26, 2009 compared to December 27, 2008 included an increase in accounts receivable of $960 million, which included the non-cash impact of our financing arrangement with IBM Credit LLC, IBM United Kingdom Financial Services Ltd and IBM Factoring (CHINA) Co., Ltd (IBM parties). Under these arrangements, we sell to the IBM parties certain accounts receivable of our distributor customers. Because we do not recognize revenue until the distributors sell our products to their customers, we classify the funds that we receive from the IBM parties as debt. IBM’s collections of accounts receivable from our customers reduces our reported accounts receivable but does not affect cash flows from operations. During 2009, IBM collected approximately $535 million from our customers pursuant to this arrangement. Therefore, without considering IBM’s collections of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, the increase in accounts receivable was $425 million. This increase was primarily due to timing of sales and collections during 2009. There was also a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $105 million, primarily due to lower purchases reflecting the effect of our cost cutting efforts and timing of payments. Net cash used in operating activities was $692 million in 2008. Net loss of $3.1 billion was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.7 billion of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible impairment 64 Table of Contents charges attributable to discontinued operations, $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $83 million of stock-based compensation expense, $77 million of other than temporary impairment on our marketable securities, $29 million net loss from the sale and disposal of property, plant and equipment and $29 million of interest expense primarily related to our 6.00% Notes. These charges were offset by a $193 million net gain on the sale of certain 200-millimeter wafer fabrication equipment, the amortization of foreign grants and allowances of $107 million and a net gain of $34 million on our repurchase of a portion of our 6.00% Notes. The net changes in our operating assets at December 27, 2008 compared to December 29, 2007 included a decrease of $722 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflecting the effects of our cost cutting efforts and a decrease of $101 million in accounts receivable. During 2008, IBM collected approximately $221 million from our customers pursuant to the financing arrangements described above. Therefore, without considering IBM’s collections of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, the decrease in accounts receivable was $322 million primarily due to a decrease in sales and improved cash collection efforts in 2008. There was also a decrease of $64 million in prepaid and other current assets primarily related to a decrease in receivables of foreign grants and allowances. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $310 million in 2007. Our net loss of $3.4 billion was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.6 billion of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible impairment charges, $1.3 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $155 million of other than temporary impairment on our marketable securities, $112 million of stock-based compensation expense and $18 million of interest expense primarily related to our 6.00% Notes. These charges were partially offset by amortization to income of foreign grants and subsidies of $167 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 29, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 included a decrease of $503 million in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease of $329 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase of $134 million in prepaid and other current assets. Our accounts receivable balance decreased due to greater efficiency in management and collection of accounts receivables. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased due to the timing of payments partially offset by increases in accrued interest and accruals for technology license payment obligations. The increase in prepaid and other assets was driven by increases in receivables for foreign grants and allowances, purchases of technology licenses and an increase in prepaid insurance. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion in 2009 primarily as a result of a net cash outflow of $883 million for the purchase of available-for-sale securities and $466 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment, of which $394 million related to property, plant and equipment attributable to the Foundry segment. This was partially offset by $58 million of proceeds from sale of certain Handheld assets and $14 million of proceeds from the maturity of trading securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $27 million in 2008. Payments of $624 million of cash used to purchase property, plant and equipment and $95 million in connection with the exercise of our call option to repurchase the partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG held by one of the unaffiliated partners, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG, were partially offset by $343 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily 200 millimeter equipment, $216 million in net proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities and $127 million of cash proceeds from sale of our Digital Television business unit. Of the total purchase price of $141.5 million, $14 million is held in escrow upon the closing of the transaction in December 2008. We are eligible to receive this amount within 18 months after the completion of the transaction, subject to specified conditions. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.7 billion in 2007. We used $1.7 billion to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $691 million to purchase equipment for Fab 36. We also purchased $545 million in available-for-sale securities. This was offset primarily by $307 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, $157 million in proceeds from sales of Spansion shares, and $73 million from sales of assets, including excess land in Sunnyvale, California and customer deposits on the sale of 200 millimeter wafer fabrication equipment. 65 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.5 billion in 2009 primarily as a result of proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of GF’s Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class A Preferred Shares and Class B Preferred Shares, of which $1.6 billion constituted cash proceeds to GF, proceeds of $605 million from the sale of certain of our accounts receivable to the IBM parties pursuant to the financing arrangement described above, proceeds of $440 million from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principle of 8.125% Notes, proceeds of $15 million from a revolving credit facility entered into by our subsidiary, AMD Products (China) Co. Ltd. and China Merchant Bank, proceeds of $125 million from the sale of 58 million shares of AMD common stock and warrants to purchase 35 million shares of AMD common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share to WCH in connection with the GF joint venture, and proceeds from grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of $55 million for GF’s Dresden manufacturing facilities. These amounts were partially offset by payments to Leipziger Messe of $180 million to repurchase its partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG, $67 million related to the guaranteed rate of return on those partnership interests and $10 million related to a call option premium to Leipziger Messe for the early repurchase of its partnership interests. Net cash provided by financing activities was also partially offset by $1.8 billion of payments on certain debt and cash obligations, consisting of $1,002 million to repurchase $1,015 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Notes, $398 million to redeem $390 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Notes and $161 million to repurchase $344 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2009 we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was $220 million in 2008, primarily due to proceeds of $308 million from the financing arrangement with the IBM parties described above and proceeds of grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of $161 million for our former Dresden manufacturing facilities. These amounts were partially offset by $166 million of payments on certain debt and cash obligations, consisting of $20 million for the repurchase of $60 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes, $38 million for the exercise of our call option to repurchase the silent partnership contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG held by Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG, $25 million for the mandatory repurchase of a portion of the silent partnership contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG held by Leipziger Messe and $19 million in payments for the guaranteed return on the unaffiliated limited partners’ limited partnership contributions. During 2008, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $2.0 billion in 2007 and consisted primarily of proceeds of: $2.2 billion from the issuance and sale of our 6.00% Notes; $1.5 billion from the issuance and sale of our 5.75% Notes; $608 million from the sale of our common stock to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company; $78 million from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of employee stock options; and $223 million of capital investment grants and allowances received from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, primarily for the Fab 36 project. These proceeds were partially offset by the $2.2 billion repayment of our October 2006 Term Loan, a payment of $182 million for the purchase of a capped call in connection with the issuance of our 6.00% Notes and a payment of $46 million for our mandatory repurchase of silent partner contributions from our unaffiliated partners in AMD Fab 36 KG. During 2007, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flow. 66 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, including GF principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 26, 2009, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period Total Fiscal2010 Fiscal2011 Fiscal2012 Fiscal2013 Fiscal2014 Fiscal 2015and beyond (In millions) 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 $ 485 $ — $ — $ 485 $ — $ — $ — 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015(1) 1,796 — — — — — 1,796 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017(1) 500 — — — — — 500 Fab 36 Term Loan 460 290 170 — — — — AMD China Revolving credit line 15 15 — — — — — Other long-term liabilities 90 25 34 23 2 2 4 Aggregate interest obligation(2) 1,126 183 177 176 167 148 275 Capital lease obligations(3) 425 49 49 50 50 50 177 Operating leases 215 59 31 26 23 18 58 Purchase obligations(4) 1,878 543 216 220 226 228 445 Total contractual obligations(5) $ 6,990 $ 1,164 $ 677 $ 980 $ 468 $ 446 $ 3,255 (1) Represents aggregate par value of the notes, without the effects of associated discounts. (2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations, including GF’s interest obligations, that are payable in cash on outstanding debt obligations, excluding capital lease obligations. Also excludes non-cash amortization of debt discounts on the 8.125% Notes and the 6.00% Notes. (3) Includes principal and imputed interest. (4) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Also, purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (5) The table above excludes GF Class A Notes and the Class B Notes because these notes are convertible to either Class A or Class B Preferred shares, as applicable, and interest is payable in additional notes. There are no contractual cash obligations associated with these notes. GF contractual obligations will no longer be part of our consolidated contractual obligations upon the deconsolidation of GF in the first quarter of 2010. As a result of the deconsolidation of GF, our purchase obligations will increase significantly because of our commitments under the Wafer Supply Agreement to purchase wafers from GF. Of the amounts set forth in the table above, GF’s principal contractual cash obligations at December 26, 2009 were as follows: Payment due by period Total Fiscal2010 Fiscal2011 Fiscal2012 Fiscal2013 Fiscal2014 Fiscal 2015and beyond (In millions) Fab 36 Term Loan $ 460 $ 290 $ 170 $ — $ — $ — $ — Aggregate interest obligation 7 6 1 — — — — Capital lease obligations 386 44 44 44 44 45 165 Other long-term liabilities 42 — 20 18 — — 4 Operating leases 9 3 2 2 2 — — Purchase obligations 1,546 213 214 220 226 228 445 Total GF contractual obligations $ 2,450 $ 556 $ 451 $ 284 $ 272 $ 273 $ 614 67 Table of Contents 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 On August 14, 2007, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (the 5.75% Notes). The 5.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2008 until the maturity date of August 15, 2012. The terms of the 5.75% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 5.75% Indenture), dated as of August 14, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. In 2009, we repurchased $1,015 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.75% Notes for $1,002 million in cash. We recorded a net gain on repurchase of approximately $6 million, which is recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in our 2009 consolidated statement of operations. The 5.75% Notes will be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 5.75% Notes, into shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 49.6771 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.75% Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $20.13 per share. This initial conversion price represents a premium of 50% relative to the last reported sale price of our common stock on August 8, 2007 (the trading date preceding the date of pricing of the 5.75% Notes) of $13.42 per share. This initial conversion rate will be adjusted for certain anti-dilution events. In addition, the conversion rate will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) of AMD under certain circumstances. Holders of the 5.75% Notes may require us to repurchase the 5.75% Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) or a termination of trading (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture). Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 5.75% Notes. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remaining amount of our 5.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 On April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015. The 6.00% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015. The terms of the 6.00% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 6.00% Indenture) dated April 27, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. In 2008, we repurchased $60 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $21 million. We recorded a net gain of approximately $34 million, which is recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statement of operations. In 2009, we repurchased $344 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $161 million. We recorded a net gain of approximately $174 million, which is recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statement of operations. Upon the occurrence of certain events described in the 6.00% Indenture, the 6.00% Notes will be convertible into cash up to the principal amount, and if applicable, into shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes in respect of any conversion value above the principal amount, based on an initial conversion rate of 35.6125 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 6.00% Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $28.08 per share. This initial conversion price represents a premium of 100% relative to the last reported sale price of our common stock on April 23, 2007 (the trading date preceding the date of pricing of the 6.00% Notes) of $14.04 per share. The conversion rate will be adjusted for certain anti-dilution events. In addition, the conversion rate will be increased in the case of corporate events that 68 Table of Contents constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture) under certain circumstances. Holders of the 6.00% Notes may require us to repurchase the 6.00% Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or a termination of trading (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture). Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 6.00% Notes. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the balance of our 6.00% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. 8.125% Senior Notes Due 2017 On November 30, 2009, we issued $500 million of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 8.125% Notes) at a discount of 10.204%. The 8.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning June 15, 2010 until the maturity date of December 15, 2017. The discount of $51 million is recorded as contra debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. From December 15, 2013, we may redeem the 8.125% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on December 15, 2013 through December 14, 2014 104.063 percent Beginning on December 15, 2014 through December 14, 2015 102.031 percent On December 15, 2015 and thereafter 100.000 percent Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 8.125% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 8.125% Notes (the 8.125% Indenture) at a repurchase price of 101 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 8.125% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 8.125% Notes. The 8.125% Indenture contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, from: • incurring additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt; • paying dividends and making other restricted payments; • making certain investments if an event of a default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; • creating or permitting certain liens; • creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • using the proceeds from sales of assets; • entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidating, merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 8.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or private negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. The agreements governing our 5.75% Notes, 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements 69 Table of Contents covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee On April 21, 2004, our former German subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 KG, the legal entity that owned our 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36, entered into a 700 million euro Term Loan Facility Agreement among AMD Fab 36 KG, as borrower, and a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, as lenders, and other related agreements (collectively, the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate Fab 36. We guaranteed the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. As of December 26, 2009, the total amount outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan was $460 million. The interest rate on the loan as of December 26, 2009 was 2.23406 percent. This loan is repayable in quarterly installments, which commenced in September 2007 and terminates in March 2011. The Fab 36 Term Loan will no longer be part of our consolidated balance sheet upon the deconsolidation of GF in the first quarter of 2010. In connection with the formation of the GF joint venture on March 2, 2009, the terms of the Fab 36 Loan Agreements were amended to allow for the transfer of Fab 36, AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliated limited partners and general partner, AMD Fab 36 Holding GmbH, AMD Fab 36 Admin GmbH and AMD Fab 36 LLC, as well as the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, to GF. In addition, we also amended the terms of the related guarantee agreement such that we and GF are joint guarantors of AMD Fab 36 KG’s obligations to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. However, if we are called upon to make any payments under the Guarantee Agreement, GF has separately agreed to indemnify us for the full amount of such payments. We must continue to comply with the covenants set forth in the Guarantee Agreement, such as the adjusted tangible net worth and the earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) financial covenants. As of December 26, 2009 we were in compliance with the Guarantee Agreement. AMD China Revolving Credit Line In November 2009, AMD Products (China) Co. Ltd. (AMD Products) entered into a one year revolving credit agreement in the amount of RMB200 million ($30 million based on a foreign exchange rate as of December 26, 2009) with China Merchant Bank to finance the working capital needs of AMD Products. The interest rate is based on the 6 month loan rates published by The People’s Bank of China. Principal and accrued interest must be repaid every 3 months. Advanced Micro Devices (China) Co., Ltd., the parent company of AMD Products, provided an irrevocable guarantee to China Merchant Bank with respect to the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. As of December 26, 2009, the outstanding balance was RMB100 million ($15 million), and the interest rate was 4.45 percent. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above includes $66 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2014, of which $39 million is GF’s obligation and $24 million related to employee benefit obligations, of which $3 million is GF’s obligation. Other long-term liabilities excludes amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which as of December 26, 2009, primarily consisted of $317 million of deferred grants and subsidies related to GF’s Dresden wafer manufacturing facilities and $70 million of deferred gains resulting from equipment sales and the sale and leaseback of our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California in 1998, and our facility in Markham, Canada in 2008. Other long-term liabilities also exclude $118 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in the caption, “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet at December 26, 2009. 70 Table of Contents Included in the non-current unrecognized tax benefits is a potential cash payment of approximately $13 million that could be payable by us upon settlement with a taxing authority. We have not included this amount in the contractual obligations table above as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of any settlement with the respective taxing authority, if any. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 26, 2009, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $256 million. Included in this amount is $225 million of GF’s obligations under certain energy supply contracts for its wafer fabrication facilities in Dresden, Germany. Certain fixed payments due under these energy supply arrangements are accounted for as capital leases. The capital lease obligations under the energy supply arrangements are payable in monthly installments through 2020. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2018. Certain manufacturing and office equipment is leased for terms ranging from 1 to 5 years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 26, 2009 were $215 million, of which $32 million is accrued as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 and 2008 restructuring plans. These payments will be made through 2012. Of the total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 26, 2009, GF is responsible for $9 million. Purchase Obligations Total non-cancelable purchase obligations as of December 26, 2009 were $1.9 billion for periods through 2020. These purchase obligations include approximately $700 million related to GF’s contractual obligations for the purchase of energy and gas for its wafer fabrication facilities in Dresden, Germany, and $828 million representing payments by GF to IBM for the period from December 26, 2009 through 2015 pursuant to its joint development agreement. As IBM’s services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, the payments are expensed as incurred. The IBM agreement and the related payment obligations as well as the obligations to purchase energy and gas were transferred to GF upon the Closing on March 2, 2009. The remaining purchase obligations include non-cancelable contractual obligations, including GF contractual obligations, to purchase raw materials, natural resources and office supplies. Due to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010, our purchase obligations will increase significantly because of our commitments under the Wafer Supply Agreement to purchase wafers from GF. Receivable financing arrangement In March 2008, we and one of our subsidiaries, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (AMDISS), entered into Sale of Receivables—Supplier Agreements with IBM Credit LLC (IBM Credit) and IBM United Kingdom Financial Services Ltd. (IBM UK), pursuant to which AMD and AMDISS agreed to sell to each of IBM Credit and IBM UK certain receivables. In November 2009, AMD (China), Co. Ltd entered into a similar financing arrangement with IBM Factoring (CHINA) Co., Ltd. Pursuant to the sales agreements, the IBM parties agreed to purchase from the AMD parties invoices of specified AMD customers up to credit limits set by the IBM parties. As of December 26, 2009, only selected distributor customers have participated in this program. Because we do not recognize revenue until our distributors sell our products to our customers, we classify funds received from the IBM parties as debt. The debt is reduced as the IBM parties receive payments from our customers. In 2009, we received proceeds of approximately $605 million from the sale of accounts receivable under these financing arrangements, and the IBM parties collected approximately $535 million from the distributors participating in the arrangements. $156 million and $86 million were outstanding under these agreements as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively. These amounts appear as “Other short-term obligations” on our consolidated balance sheets and are not considered cash commitments. In December 2009, we expanded our relationship with IBM to include selected distributor receivables of our Canadian subsidiary, ATI Technologies. 71 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees of Indebtedness Not Recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co. KG (BAC) are joint ventures initially formed for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. AMTC provides advanced photomasks for use in manufacturing our microprocessors. As of December 26, 2009, the joint venture limited partners were AMD and Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. Qimonda AG, who had been one of the limited partners in these joint ventures, was expelled in March 2009 because of its commencement of insolvency proceeding in January 2009. In December 2002, BAC obtained a euro denominated term loan to finance the construction of the photomask facility pursuant to which the equivalent of $29 million was outstanding as of December 26, 2009. Also in December 2002, each of Toppan Photomasks Germany GmbH, and AMTC, as lessees, entered into a lease agreement with BAC, as lessor. The term of the lease agreement is 10 years from initial occupancy. Each joint venture partner guaranteed a specific percentage of AMTC’s portion of the rental payments. The rental payments to BAC are in turn used by BAC to repay amounts outstanding under the BAC term loan. There is no separate guarantee outstanding for the BAC term loan. With respect to the lease agreement, AMTC may exercise a “step-in” right in which it would take over Toppan Germany’s remaining rental payments in connection with the lease agreement between Toppan Photomask Germany and BAC. As of December 26, 2009, our guarantee of AMTC’s portion of the rental obligation was approximately $10 million. Our maximum liability in the event AMTC exercises its “step-in” right and Toppan defaults under the guarantee would be approximately $47 million. These estimates are based upon forecasted rents to be charged by BAC in the future and are subject to change based upon the actual usage of the facility by the tenants and foreign currency exchange rates. In December 2007, AMTC entered into a euro denominated revolving credit facility, pursuant to which the equivalent of $50 million was outstanding as of December 26, 2009. The term of the revolving credit facility is 3 years. Upon request by AMTC and subject to certain conditions, the term of the revolving credit facility may be extended for up to 2 additional years. In June 2009, the AMTC revolving credit facility and related documents were amended to reflect Qimonda’s expulsion from the joint ventures. Pursuant to the amended guarantee agreement, each of AMD and Toppan guarantee 50% of AMTC’s outstanding loan balance under the revolving credit facility. As of December 26, 2009, our potential obligation under this guarantee was the equivalent of $25 million plus our portion of accrued interest and expenses. Under the terms of the guarantee, if our group consolidated cash (which is defined as cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities less the aggregate amount outstanding under any revolving credit facility and not including GF cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities) is less than or expected to be less than $500 million, we will be required to provide cash collateral equal to 50% of the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As of March 28, 2009, Qimonda owed AMTC approximately $20 million in connection with its committed capacity allocations. However, as a result of the commencement of insolvency proceedings, these amounts are considered insolvency claims and will be handled along with the claims of Qimonda’s other creditors. Because we believe that AMTC is unlikely to recover amounts due from Qimonda during the insolvency proceedings, we recorded a charge of $10 million, or 50 percent of the total receivable, in the first quarter of 2009. As of December 26, 2009, this receivable was still outstanding. In January 2010, we signed binding agreements to transfer our limited partnership interests in AMTC and BAC to GF. The transfer of our limited partnership interests in the AMTC and BAC must be approved by the lenders under the AMTC revolving credit facility and the BAC term loan and also by German regulatory authorities. The transfer of our limited partnership interests will become effective upon these approvals and registration with the German courts. Pursuant to the January 2010 agreements, our guarantee exposure remains as described above except that GF is a joint guarantor. However, if we are called upon to make any payments under these guarantees, GF has agreed to indemnify us for the full amount of such payments under certain conditions. In addition, 72 Table of Contents simultaneously with the transfer of our limited partnership interests in AMD and BAC to GF, AMTC would assume Toppan Germany’s obligations under the BAC lease agreement without AMD assuming any additional guarantee for such rental payments. Discontinued Operations In 2008, we evaluated the viability of our non-core businesses and determined that our Digital Television business unit was not directly aligned with our core strategy of computing and graphics market opportunities and we decided to divest this business unit. We performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets during 2008. We concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and certain acquisition-related intangible assets associated with the Digital Television business unit were impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge of $473 million. During the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with Broadcom Corporation to sell the Digital Television business unit for $141.5 million. The transaction was completed on October 27, 2008. Based on the final terms of the sale transaction, we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $135 million. As a result of the decisions and transactions described above, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance, the operating results of the Digital Television business unit are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Cash flows from discontinued operations were not material and were combined with cash flows from continuing operations within the consolidated statement of cash flows categories. The results from discontinued operations for our former Digital Television business unit were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Net revenue $ — $ 73 $ 155 Expenses (3 ) (147 ) (230 ) Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets — (609 ) (476 ) Restructuring charges — (1 ) — Loss from discontinued operations $ (3 ) $ (684 ) $ (551 ) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Variable Interest Entities. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance that amends the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Additionally, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods after November 15, 2009. We adopted this new guidance as of the beginning of fiscal year 2010 and we have applied such guidance in evaluating whether we should continue to consolidate GF given the changes in governance over the operations of GF that occurred effective December 28, 2009. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on our analysis, beginning the first day of fiscal 2010, we will deconsolidate GF and account for GF under the equity method of accounting. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 26, 2009, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of money market funds and ARS. With the exception of our ARS, these investments were highly liquid. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 26, 2009, the majority of our outstanding debt, including GF debt, is fixed interest rate debt. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we will no longer consolidate the financial results of GF, and 73 Table of Contents substantially all of our debt will be at a fixed interest rate. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is limited. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. There was significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during 2008. While financial markets stabilized in 2009, the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of such securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 26, 2009, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were AAA rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. We believe the current credit market difficulties do not have a material impact on our financial position. However, a future degradation in credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. During 2008, the market conditions for ARS deteriorated due to the uncertainties in the credit markets. As a result, we were not able to sell our ARS as scheduled in the auction market. As of December 26, 2009, we had approximately $159 million investments in ARS. See “Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report for further information.

As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro (with respect to GF asset and liabilities) and Canadian dollar, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. We use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Realized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward contracts, net of changes in the value of the hedged exposures, for the year ended December 26, 2009 were not material. As of December 26, 2009, we had unrealized foreign currency forward contract gains of $2 million that were recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). In addition, upon deconsolidation of GF in the first quarter of 2010, our outstanding euro currency forward contracts will cease to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting because we will no longer have direct exposure to the euro denominated forecasted spending incurred by GF that those contracts were intended to hedge. While GF will bill us in U.S. dollars, those billings will, nonetheless, reflect fluctuations in the euro because some of GF’s wafer costs will be based on euro denominated costs. Therefore, our operating results and cash flows will continue to be indirectly exposed to fluctuations in the euro even after deconsolidation. We intend to economically hedge this indirect euro exposure by entering into euro currency forward contracts. However, because these contracts do not qualify as cash flow hedges, the mark-to-market impact of these contracts cannot be included in cost of sales. Rather, those mark-to-market adjustments will be recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statements of operations. Therefore, while our objective of reducing our earnings and cash flow exposure to euro fluctuations may be achieved in a given reporting period, our reported gross margin and other income (expense) may become increasingly volatile, albeit in offsetting directions, depending on the volatility of the euro. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. In particular, generally we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll and materials. We cannot provide assurance that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 75 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010 and related notes, which are included in this Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction We are a global semiconductor company with facilities around the world. Within the global semiconductor industry, we offer primarily: • x86 microprocessors, for the commercial and consumer markets, embedded microprocessors for commercial, commercial client and consumer markets and chipsets for desktop and notebook PCs, professional workstations and servers; and • graphics, video and multimedia products for desktop and notebook PCs, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers, and technology for game consoles. In MD&A, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2010 compared to 2009 and 2009 compared to 2008, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. For accounting purposes, we consolidated the accounts of GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF) and its consolidated subsidiaries from March 2, 2009 through December 26, 2009. Accordingly, for this period, references in this Item 7 and in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to “us,” “our,” or “AMD” include the consolidated operating results of AMD and its consolidated subsidiaries, including GF and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview Entering 2010, our most important goals were: to deliver winning platform products; to differentiate ourselves with our graphics technology; to launch the AMD Fusion family of APUs and to demonstrate the success of our financial and business models focusing on semiconductor design. In 2010, we delivered a number of new products. In April 2010, we launched our new mainstream and enthusiast desktop platforms, and in May 2010, we launched two notebook platforms targeted at the mainstream market and the small and thin-and-light notebook market. At a time when visual computing is becoming an increasingly important part of the user experience, we introduced the industry’s first mobile graphics processor with Microsoft DirectX® 11 (DX 11) gaming support for notebook computers and extended this family of DX 11 capable graphics into the mainstream and value segments of the PC market. Also, for servers, we launched our AMD Opteron 6000 series and Opteron 4000 series platforms, targeting the performance and value conscious markets. At the end of 2010, we had more than 70 designs with the major OEMs. However, despite the number of systems, we did not have the volume of sales that we would have liked, and we expect to increase our focus on this opportunity in 2011. Also in 2010, although we experienced a delay in delivering our APU manufactured using 32nm technology, we shipped the first of our AMD Fusion family of APU processor products featuring our new x86 CPU core, codenamed “Bobcat.” On a macroeconomic level, consumer demand for end-user PC products grew in the first half of 2010, but the pace of that growth slowed in the second half of 2010. Despite the more challenging economic environment in the latter half of 2010, we were profitable in 2010. Our financial results improved in 2010 compared to 2009 as the demand for our Graphics and Computing Solutions segment products increased. Net revenue for 2010 was $6.5 billion, a 20% increase compared to net revenue of $5.4 billion for 2009, and during 2010, our sales in 39 Table of Contents China and Japan increased significantly by $561 million and $255 million, respectively, as compared to 2009. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we deconsolidated GF, and began accounting for our investment in GF under the equity method of accounting. Entering 2011, we announced that we will be applying the cost method of accounting for our investment in GF, and will no longer recognize any share of GF’s net income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. In 2010, we also made significant progress in improving our balance sheet by reducing our debt and adjusting our debt maturity schedule. Without taking into account GF’s debt, in the aggregate, we reduced our debt by approximately $357 million during 2010. Specifically, during 2010, we repurchased $1,016 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.00% Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes), reducing the outstanding aggregate principal amount to $780 million, and we issued $500 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes). Our debt and capital lease obligations as of December 25, 2010 were $2.4 billion, which reflects the debt discount adjustment of $103 million on our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Senior Notes Due 2017 (8.125% Notes). This amount also includes approximately $229 million related to our accounts receivable financing arrangement with IBM, which is not a cash obligation and is described in more detail in the “Financial Condition –Liquidity” section below. Furthermore, GAAP net cash used in operating activities was $412 million. We also generated non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, which we describe in more detail in the “Financial Condition –Liquidity” section, of $355 million. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 25, 2010 were $1.8 billion compared to $2.7 billion at December 26, 2009, of which $904 million represented GF cash and cash equivalents. Without taking into account the GF financial position, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were essentially flat when compared to 2009. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Formation and Accounting in 2009 On March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, ATIC, and WCH, pursuant to which we formed GF. At the closing of these transactions (the Closing), we contributed certain assets and liabilities to GF, including, among other things, shares of the groups of German subsidiaries owning our manufacturing facilities, certain manufacturing assets, real property, tangible personal property, employees, inventories, books and records, a portion of our patent portfolio, intellectual property and technology, rights under certain material contracts and authorizations necessary for GF to carry on its business. In exchange we received GF securities consisting of one Class A Ordinary Share, 1,090,950 Class A Preferred Shares and 700,000 Class B Preferred Shares, and the assumption of certain liabilities by GF. ATIC contributed $1.4 billion of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities consisting of one Class A Ordinary Share, 218,190 Class A Preferred Shares, 172,760 Class B Preferred Shares, $202 million aggregate principal amount of 4% Class A Subordinated Convertible Notes (the Class A Notes) and $807 million aggregate principal amount of 11% Class B Subordinated Convertible Notes (the Class B Notes), and transferred $700 million of cash to us in exchange for the transfer by us of 700,000 GF Class B Preferred Shares. At the Closing, we also issued to WCH, for an aggregate purchase price of $125 million, 58 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 35 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the Warrants). The Warrants are currently exercisable and expire on March 2, 2019. The shares issuable under these Warrants have been included in our basic and diluted earnings per share calculation since the third quarter of 2009 when the Warrants became exercisable. Under the Master Transaction Agreement, the cash consideration that WCH and ATIC paid and the securities that they received are as follows: • Cash paid by WCH to AMD for the purchase of 58 million shares of AMD common stock and Warrants: $125 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for the aggregate principal amount of Class A Notes, which are convertible into 201,810 Class A Preferred Shares: $202 million; 40 Table of Contents • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes, which are convertible into 807,240 Class B Preferred Shares: $807 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for 218,190 Class A Preferred Shares: $218 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for 172,760 Class B Preferred Shares: $173 million; and • Cash paid by ATIC to AMD for 700,000 Class B Preferred Shares: $700 million. At the Closing, AMD and ATIC owned 1,090,950, or 83%, and 218,190, or 17%, respectively, of Class A Preferred Shares, and ATIC owned 100% of the Class B Preferred Shares and 100% of the Class A Notes and Class B Notes. In November 2009, upon the settlement of the Intel litigation (discussed in the “Legal Settlements” section, below) and the execution of a patent cross license agreement between us and Intel, the requirements satisfying the Reconciliation Event were met. As a result, GF’s Class A and Class B Preferred Shares vote on an as converted basis with any outstanding GF Ordinary Shares. Class B Preferred Shares. GF’s Class B Preferred Shares rank senior in right of payment to all other classes or series of equity securities of GF for purposes of dividends, distributions and upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of GF (Liquidation Event). Each Class B Preferred Share is deemed to accrete in value at a rate of 12% per year, compounded semiannually, of the initial purchase price per such share. The accreted value accrues daily from the Closing and is taken into account upon certain distributions to the holders of Class B Preferred Shares or upon conversion of the Class B Preferred Shares. Upon a Liquidation Event, each Class B Preferred Share will be entitled to receive, prior to any distribution to the holders of any other classes or series of equity securities, an amount equal to its accreted value. Each Class B Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class B Conversion Rate. Each Class B Preferred Share will also automatically convert into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class B Conversion Rate upon the earlier of (i) an initial public offering of GF (IPO) or (ii) a change of control transaction of GF. The initial Class B Conversion Rate is 100 Class B Ordinary Shares for each Class B Preferred Share converted, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Class B Preferred Shares currently vote on an as-converted basis with any outstanding Ordinary Shares, voting together as a single class, with respect to any question upon which holders of Ordinary Shares have the right to vote. Class A Preferred Shares. GF’s Class A Preferred Shares rank senior in right of payment to the Ordinary Shares of GF and junior in right of payment to the Class B Preferred Shares for purposes of dividends, distributions and upon a Liquidation Event. The Class A Preferred Shares are not entitled to any dividend or pre-determined accretion in value. Upon a Liquidation Event, each Class A Preferred Share will be entitled to receive, after the distribution to the holders of the Class B Preferred Shares but prior to any distribution to the holders of Ordinary Shares, out of any remaining assets of GF, an amount equal to the initial purchase price per share of the Class A Preferred Shares. Each Class A Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder, into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class A Conversion Rate. Each Class A Preferred Share will also automatically convert into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class A Conversion Rate upon the earlier of (i) an IPO or (ii) a change of control transaction of GF. The initial Class A Conversion Rate is 100 Class B Ordinary Shares for each Class A Preferred Share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Class A Preferred Shares currently vote on an as-converted basis with any outstanding Ordinary Shares, voting together as a single class, with respect to any question upon which holders of Ordinary Shares have the right to vote. Class A Subordinated Convertible Notes. GF’s Class A Notes accrue interest at a rate of 4% per annum, compounded semiannually. Interest on the Class A Notes is payable semiannually in additional Class A Notes. The Class A Notes are the unsecured obligations of GF and rank subordinated in right of payment to any current or future senior indebtedness of GF. The Class A Notes are not redeemable by GF without the note holder’s 41 Table of Contents consent. The Class A Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, in multiples of $1,000, into GF Class A Preferred Shares at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date based on the conversion ratio in effect on the date of conversion. The Class A Notes mature ten years from the date of issuance. However, they automatically convert into Class A Preferred Shares upon the earlier of (i) an IPO, (ii) certain change of control transactions of GF or (iii) the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Class B Subordinated Convertible Notes. GF’s Class B Notes accrue interest at a rate of 11% per annum, compounded semiannually. Interest on the Class B Notes is payable semiannually in additional Class B Notes. The Class B Notes are the unsecured obligations of GF and rank subordinated in right of payment to any current or future senior indebtedness of GF. The Class B Notes are not redeemable by GF without the note holder’s consent. The Class B Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, in multiples of $1,000, into GF Class B Preferred Shares at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date at the conversion ratio in effect on the date of conversion. The Class B Notes mature ten years from the date of issuance. However, they automatically convert into GF Class B Preferred Shares upon the earlier of (i) an IPO, (ii) certain change of control transactions of GF or (iii) the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Based on the structure of the transaction and the guidance on accounting for interests in variable interest entities, during 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we were required to consolidate the accounts of GF from March 2, 2009 through December 26, 2009. For this period, ATIC’s noncontrolling interest, represented by its equity interests in GF, was presented outside of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet due to ATIC’s right to put those securities back to us in the event of a change of control of AMD during the two years following the date of the Closing. Our net income attributable to common stockholders per share consists of our consolidated net income, as adjusted for (i) the portion of GF’s losses attributable to ATIC, which is based on ATIC’s proportional ownership interest in GF’s Class A Preferred Shares (17% in 2009), and (ii) the non-cash accretion on GF’s Class B Preferred Shares attributable to us, based on our proportional ownership interest of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares (83% in 2009). At the Closing, we, ATIC and GF also entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement), and a Wafer Supply Agreement (the Wafer Supply Agreement), certain terms of which are summarized below. Shareholders’ Agreement. The Shareholders’ Agreement sets forth the rights and obligations of AMD and ATIC as shareholders of GF. The initial GF board of directors (GF Board) consisted of eight directors, and AMD and ATIC each designated four directors. After the Reconciliation Event (discussed above), the number of directors a GF shareholder may designate increases or decreases according to the percentage of GF’s shares it owns on a fully diluted basis. We had the right to designate three directors to the GF Board as of December 26, 2009. Pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, if a change of control of AMD occurs within two years of Closing, ATIC will have the right to put any or all GF securities (valued at their fair market value) held by ATIC and its permitted transferees to us in exchange for cash. In addition, if a change of control of AMD occurs after the Reconciliation Event, ATIC will have the option to purchase in cash any or all of the GF securities (valued at their fair market value) held by us and our permitted transferees, ATIC can require us or the other party to the change in control transaction to assume a pro-rata portion of ATIC’s funding commitment under the Funding Agreement until 2013, and ATIC can require the other party to the change in control transaction to guarantee all of our obligations under the transaction documents. Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement provides for the funding of GF and governs the terms and conditions under which ATIC is obligated to provide such funding. Pursuant to the Funding Agreement, ATIC has committed to additional equity funding of a minimum of $3.6 billion and up to $6.0 billion to be provided in phases over five years from the Closing. The aggregate amount of equity funding to be provided by the 42 Table of Contents shareholders in any year depends on the time period of such funding and the amounts set forth in the five-year capital plan of GF. In addition, GF is required to obtain specified third-party debt in any given year, as set forth in its five-year capital plan. To the extent that GF obtains more than the specified amount of third-party debt, ATIC is able to reduce its funding commitment accordingly. We have the right, but not the obligation, to provide additional future capital to GF in an amount pro rata to our interest in the fully converted Ordinary Shares of GF. To the extent we choose not to participate in an equity financing of GF, ATIC is obligated to purchase our share of GF securities, subject to ATIC’s funding commitments under the Funding Agreement. ATIC’s obligations to provide funding are subject to certain conditions, including the accuracy of GF’s representations and warranties in the Funding Agreement, the absence of a material adverse effect on GF or us and the absence of a material breach or default by GF or us under the provisions of any transaction document. There are additional funding conditions for each of the phases which are set forth in more detail in the Funding Agreement. During 2009, pursuant to a funding request from GF in accordance with the Funding Agreement, ATIC contributed $260 million of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities consisting of $52 million aggregate principal amount of Class A Notes and $208 million aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes. We declined to participate in the funding. As of December 26, 2009, our ownership interest in GF (on a fully converted to Ordinary Shares basis) was approximately 32%. Wafer Supply Agreement. The Wafer Supply Agreement governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the Wafer Supply Agreement, we purchase substantially all of our microprocessor unit (MPU) product requirements from GF. We currently pay GF for wafers on a cost-plus basis. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures MPU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such MPU products to GF. In addition, once GF establishes certain specific qualified processes for bulk silicon wafers, we will purchase from GF, where competitive, specified percentages of our GPU requirements. At our request, GF will also provide sort services to us on a product-by-product basis. We will provide GF with binding product forecasts of our MPU and GPU product requirements. The price for GPU products will be determined by the parties when GF is able to begin manufacturing GPU products for us. The Wafer Supply Agreement is in effect through March 2, 2024. However, the Wafer Supply Agreement may be terminated if a business plan deadlock occurs because we or ATIC, as the shareholders of GF, are unable to agree on GF’s annual business plan and ATIC elects to enter into a transition period pursuant to the Funding Agreement. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider, and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the Wafer Supply Agreement. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor products will remain as set forth in the Wafer Supply Agreement, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply. Governance Changes, Funding and Accounting in 2010 Deconsolidation of GF On December 18, 2009, ATIC International Investment Company (ATIC II) acquired Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (Chartered). On December 28, 2009, with our consent, ATIC II, Chartered and GF entered into a Management and Operating Agreement (MOA), which provided for the joint management and operation of GF and Chartered, thereby allowing GF and Chartered to share costs, take advantage of operating synergies and market wafer fabrications services on a collective basis. In order to allow for the signing of the MOA on December 28, 2009, prior to obtaining any regulatory approvals, we agreed to irrevocably waive rights under the Shareholders Agreement with respect to certain matters that require unanimous GF Board approval. Additionally, if any such matters come before the GF Board, we agreed that our designated GF 43 Table of Contents directors will vote in the same manner as the majority of ATIC-designated GF Board members voting on any such matters. As a result of waiving such approval rights, as of December 28, 2009, for financial reporting purposes we no longer shared control with ATIC over GF. Based on our fully diluted ownership interest in GF, we had the right to designate two directors to the GF Board of Directors as of December 25, 2010. In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. This new guidance became effective for us beginning the first day of 2010. Under the new guidance, the investor who is deemed to both (i) have the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s economic performance and (ii) be exposed to losses and returns will be the primary beneficiary who should then consolidate the variable interest entity. We evaluated whether the governance changes described above would, pursuant to the new guidance, affect our consolidation of GF. We considered the purpose and design of GF, the activities of GF that most significantly affect the economic performance of GF and the concept of “who has the power,” as contemplated by the new guidance. Based on the results of this evaluation and in light of the governance changes whereby we believe we only had protective rights relative to the operations of GF, we concluded that the other investor in GF, ATIC, is the party who has the power to direct the activities of GF that most significantly impact GF’s performance and is, therefore, the primary beneficiary of GF. Accordingly, effective as of December 27, 2009, we deconsolidated GF and started accounting for our ownership interest in GF under the equity method of accounting. For purposes of our application of the equity method of accounting during 2010, we recorded our share of GF’s results, excluding the results of Chartered because GF did not have an equity ownership interest in Chartered. The terms of the Funding Agreement and the Wafer Supply Agreement described above were not affected by the deconsolidation of GF. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party. Our expenses related to GF’s wafer manufacturing were $1.2 billion and related to GF’s research and development activities were $114 million for the year ended December 25, 2010. Funding of GF Pursuant to each GF funding request from the beginning of 2010 through November 17, 2010, the equity securities issued by GF consisted of 20% of Class A Preferred Shares and 80% of Class B Preferred Shares. On November 24, 2010, we, ATIC and GF signed a letter agreement regarding fundings of GF. Pursuant to this letter agreement, the parties agreed that the securities to be issued in consideration of any future GF funding would consist solely of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares. In addition, the purchase price per Class A Preferred Share would be determined by dividing GF’s net tangible assets (derived from its most recent fiscal year-end audited consolidated balance sheet) by GF’s total number of outstanding preferred shares (assuming the conversion of any outstanding GF Class A Notes into Class A Preferred Shares and Class B Notes into Class B Preferred Shares) as of the date of the balance sheet referred to above and multiplying by 1.10. Prior to the letter agreement, the funding multiple was 0.90. During 2010, ATIC contributed $930 million of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities consisting of 444,313 Class A Preferred Shares and 617,695 Class B Preferred Shares. We did not participate in the fundings. As a result, our ownership interest in GF’s Class A Preferred Shares decreased from approximately 83% as of December 26, 2009 to approximately 62% as of December 25, 2010, and our ownership interest in GF, on a fully converted to Ordinary Shares basis, was approximately 23%. These contributions resulted in an aggregate gain on issuance of new GF shares of $232 million, which we recorded as part of the equity in net loss of investee line item on our consolidated statement of operations. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd. (formerly Chartered) Contribution in Fiscal 2011 On December 27, 2010, ATIC International Investment Company LLC, an affiliate of ATIC, contributed all of the outstanding Ordinary Shares of GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd., a private limited company organized in Singapore (formerly Chartered), to GF in exchange for 2,808,981 newly issued Class A Preferred Shares. As a result, we amended and restated the Shareholders’ Agreement and the Funding Agreement. Subject 44 Table of Contents to certain exceptions set forth in the Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement, our right to designate one representative to the GF board of directors will continue for at least two years following the date on which our ownership in GF, on a fully converted to GF Ordinary Shares basis, falls below 10%, the point at which we previously lost the right to such board representative. Among other things, the Amended and Restated Funding Agreement incorporated the terms of the letter agreement referenced above. The issuance of Class A Preferred Shares to ATIC International diluted our ownership interest in GF from 23% to 14% on a fully converted to GF Ordinary Shares basis and from 34% to 18% on a voting basis. Moreover, as a result of the contribution, we expect to realize a non-cash gain as a result of the dilution of our equity interest in GF, which will be reflected in our investment in GF balance during the first quarter of 2011. We cannot estimate the amount of gain at this time, but we expect it to be material. In connection with our reduced ownership interest in GF, we were required to decrease the number of AMD-designated directors on GF’s Board from two to one. Also, in connection with the contribution and the amendments to the Shareholders’ Agreement and the Funding Agreement, we assessed our ability to exercise significant influence over GF. We considered factors such as representation on GF’s Board, participation in GF’s policy-making processes, material intra-entity transactions, interchange of managerial personnel, technological dependency, and the extent of our ownership in GF in relation to ownership by the other shareholder. Based on the results of the assessment, we concluded that as of December 27, 2010, we no longer have the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, effective as of December 27, 2010, we changed our method of accounting for our ownership interest in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method of accounting, we will no longer recognize any share of GF’s net income or loss in our statement of operations. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near-term factory production planning. Generally, inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand for the next two quarters are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, 45 Table of Contents competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present. We perform the annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. Implied fair value of goodwill is determined by considering both the income and market approach. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units, discounted using estimated discount rates. The key assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 15% to 30%. Discount rates are based on our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the risks associated with operations. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets including Acquired Intangible Assets. We consider quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we test for recoverability of the asset by determining whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. Significant judgment is involved in estimating future cash flows and deriving the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, and in evaluating the results of appraisals or other valuation methods. For example, in recent analyses performed, discount rates have ranged from 18% to 32%, but this may not be indicative of future analyses. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results, which also reduces the carrying basis of the related asset. The new carrying value of the related asset is depreciated or amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We also must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful life of the asset. We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. For assets held for sale, impairment losses are measured at the lower of the carrying amount of the assets or the fair value of the assets less costs to sell. For assets to be disposed of other than by sale, impairment losses are measured as their carrying amount less salvage value, if any, at the time the assets cease to be used. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred 46 Table of Contents tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Results of Operations We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. We review and assess operating performance using segment net revenues and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net, equity in net loss of investee and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. In the first quarter of 2008, we reviewed and addressed operating performance using the following reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which included microprocessors, chipsets and embedded processors and related revenue; • the Graphics segment, which included graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue; and • the Consumer Electronics segment, which included products used in handheld devices, digital televisions and other consumer electronics products, as well as revenue from royalties received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. In the second quarter of 2008, we decided to divest our Handheld and Digital Television business units, which were previously part of the Consumer Electronics segment. As a result, we classified these business units as discontinued operations in our financial statements and began reviewing and assessing operating performance using the following reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which included microprocessors, chipsets and embedded processors and related revenue; and • the Graphics segment, which included graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue as well as revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that, based on ongoing negotiations related to the divestiture of the Handheld business unit, the discontinued operations classification criteria for this business unit were no longer met. As a result, we classified the results of the Handheld business unit back into continuing operations. In the first quarter of 2009, as a result of the formation of GF, we began reviewing and assessing operating performance using the following reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which included microprocessors, chipsets and embedded processors and related revenue; 47 Table of Contents • the Graphics segment, which included graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue as well as revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology; and • the Foundry segment, which included operating results attributable to front end wafer manufacturing operations and related activities, including the operating results of GF, from March 2, 2009 to December 26, 2009. In addition to these reportable segments, we had an All Other category, which was not a reportable segment. This category included certain expenses and credits that were not allocated to any of the operating segments because management did not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the operating segments. These expenses were non-Foundry segment related expenses and included impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets, employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We also reported the results of the Handheld business unit in the All Other category because the operating results of this business unit were not material. The Handheld business unit consisted of the AMD Imageon™ media processor brand and handheld products that were part of the Handheld business unit prior to the sale of certain graphics and multimedia technology assets and intellectual property to Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm) during the first quarter of 2009. We also had an Intersegment Eliminations category, which was also not a reportable segment. This category included intersegment eliminations for revenue, cost of sales and profits on inventory related to transactions between the Computing Solutions segment and the Foundry segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, as a result of the deconsolidation of GF, we no longer had a Foundry segment or an Intersegment Eliminations category. We began reviewing and assessing operating performance using the following reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which includes microprocessors, chipsets and embedded processors and related revenue; and • the Graphics segment, which includes graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue as well as revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. In addition, starting in the first quarter of 2010, we began accounting for the embedded graphics business under the Computing Solutions segment. Previously, operating results related to this business were recorded as part of the Graphics segment. Information for prior periods has been recast to reflect this change. We continue to have an All Other category, as described above, and the results of the Handheld business unit continue to be reported in this category because we expect that the operating results of this business unit will continue to be immaterial. We use a 52- to 53-week fiscal year. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 each included 52 weeks. References in this report to 2010, 2009 and 2008 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. 48 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for 2010, 2009 and 2008. Information specific to the Foundry segment and Intersegment Eliminations for 2008 have not been recast to reflect the Foundry segment changes noted above for 2009 because it is not practicable to do so. Accordingly, 2009 information is not comparable to prior period information. 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing Solutions $ 4,817 $ 4,170 $ 4,591 Graphics 1,663 1,167 1,132 Foundry — 1,101 — All Other 14 66 85 Intersegment Eliminations — (1,101 ) — Total net revenue $ 6,494 $ 5,403 $ 5,808 Operating income (loss): Computing Solutions $ 529 $ 142 $ (458 ) Graphics 149 35 9 Foundry — (433 ) — All Other 170 968 (1,506 ) Intersegment Eliminations — (48 ) — Total operating income (loss) $ 848 $ 664 $ (1,955 ) Interest income 11 16 39 Interest expense (199 ) (438 ) (391 ) Other income (expense), net 311 166 (37 ) Equity in net loss of investee (462 ) — — Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 509 $ 408 $ (2,344 ) Computing Solutions Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.8 billion in 2010 increased 16% compared to net revenue of $4.2 billion in 2009, primarily as a result of an 18% increase in unit shipments partially offset by a 2% decrease in average selling price. The increase in unit shipments was attributable to an increase in unit shipments of our microprocessor products for notebook PCs as well as chipset products, resulting primarily from an improved economic environment. In addition, chipset unit shipments increased as customers increasingly adopted AMD chipsets with our microprocessor products, while unit shipments of our microprocessors for notebook PCs increased due to increased demand from existing and new customers for our new notebook platforms. Average selling price decreased due to a decrease in average selling price of embedded processors, partially offset by an increase in average selling price of our chipsets and microprocessor products. Average selling price of embedded processors decreased due to a shift in our product mix to lower-end, legacy products. Average selling price of microprocessor products increased due to a favorable shift in our product mix to higher end microprocessors, especially for servers, as customers continued to transition to our AMD Opteron™ 6000 series server platforms. Average selling price of our chipsets products increased primarily due to a shift in product mix. Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.2 billion in 2009 decreased 9% compared to net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2008. In 2008, Computing Solutions net revenue included $191 million in revenue from the licensing of certain manufacturing process technology to a third party, which accounted for 4% of this total. Without the effect of the process technology license revenue, Computing Solutions net revenue would have decreased 5% primarily as a result of a 16% decrease in the average selling price partially offset by a 13% increase in unit shipments. The average selling price decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price of microprocessors, especially for notebook PCs, and a greater mix of chipsets, which typically have a lower 49 Table of Contents average selling price. Competitive market conditions and the macroeconomic challenges that affected the global economy, especially in the first half of 2009, caused us to decrease the price of many of our Computing Solutions products, and also contributed to a shift in our product mix to lower end microprocessors. The increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for chipsets and microprocessors for notebooks. Chipset unit shipments increased, especially in the second half of 2009, as customers increasingly adopted AMD chipsets with our microprocessor products. Unit shipments of our microprocessors for notebooks increased, especially in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to increased demand in the overall notebook PC market, as end users increasingly demanded notebook PCs over desktop PCs. Computing Solutions operating income was $529 million in 2010 compared to $142 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above and a $25 million decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a $224 million increase in research and development expenses and a $61 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales decreased due to reductions in manufacturing costs and a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Computing Solutions operating income was $142 million in 2009 compared to an operating loss of $458 million in 2008. Operating results for 2009 are not comparable to operating results for 2008 because of the creation of the Foundry segment in the first quarter of 2009, which resulted in our reporting certain research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses in the Foundry segment that we would previously have reported in the Computing Solutions segment. Operating loss in 2008 included a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment and $191 million of process technology license revenue that did not occur in 2009. Graphics Graphics net revenue of $1.7 billion in 2010 increased 43% compared to net revenue of $1.2 billion in 2009. The increase was due to a 49% increase in net revenue from sales of GPU products. Net revenue from sales of GPU products increased primarily due to an increase in both GPU unit shipments and average selling price. Unit shipments increased due to strong demand for our DX 11—ATI Radeon™ products. However, the increase was limited by supply constraints primarily related to constrained wafer foundry capacity in the first half of 2010. Supply constraints improved in the third quarter of 2010, and we did not experience any supply constraints during the fourth quarter of 2010. GPU average selling price increased due to a favorable shift in our product mix to higher end GPU products. Graphics net revenue of $1.2 billion in 2009 increased 3% compared to net revenue of $1.1 billion in 2008. The increase was due to a 5% increase in revenue from the sale of GPU products partially offset by a 3% decrease in royalty revenue received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. Revenue from the sale of GPU products increased due to an increase in GPU unit shipments partially offset by a decrease in GPU average selling price. GPU unit shipments increased primarily due to an increase in demand for our graphics products, especially our 40nm ATI Radeon HD 5000 series of products, which we introduced in September 2009. We believe that the increase in GPU unit shipments was limited as a result of supply constraints with respect to our next generation GPUs. GPU average selling price decreased due to competitive pricing pressure and a shift in our product mix to more value-priced GPUs. However, the decline in GPU average selling price that we experienced during the first three quarters of 2009 was mitigated by improved GPU average selling price in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to sales of our higher priced ATI Radeon HD 5000 series of products. Royalty revenue decreased primarily due to decreased demand for the latest generation of game consoles in light of the macroeconomic environment in the first half of 2009. Graphics operating income was $149 million in 2010 compared to $35 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $345 million increase in 50 Table of Contents cost of sales due to higher GPU unit shipments, a $22 million increase in research and development expenses and a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Graphics operating income was $35 million in 2009 compared to operating income of $9 million 2008. The increase in operating results was primarily due to a $41 million increase in net revenue described above and a $29 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses due to a reduction in discretionary spending. These were partially offset by a $29 million increase in cost of sales because of higher GPU unit shipments. Foundry Foundry net revenue was $1.1 billion in 2009. Foundry operating loss was $433 million in 2009. In 2010 and 2008, we did not have a Foundry segment. All Other All Other net revenue of $14 million in 2010 decreased by 79% compared to net revenue of $66 million in 2009. All Other net revenue decreased because of a significant reduction in customer orders for Handheld products. Customer orders decreased as we continued to exit this business. All Other net revenue of $66 million in 2009 decreased 21% compared to $85 million in 2008. All Other net revenue decreased because we no longer developed new Handheld products, and we experienced reduced customer orders in 2009. We decided to exit the Handheld business after selling certain graphics and multimedia technology assets and intellectual property to Qualcomm in the first quarter of 2009. All Other operating income in 2010 was $170 million compared to $968 million in 2009. The decrease in operating results was primarily attributable to an absence of $1.2 billion of income from the settlement of our litigation with Intel in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the decrease in revenue referenced above, partially offset by $283 million of income from the settlement of our litigation with Samsung in the fourth quarter of 2010, a $77 million decrease in cost of sales, an absence of $65 million in restructuring charges, a $38 million decrease in research and development expenses, a $21 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses and a $9 million decrease in amortization due to certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to a one-time benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the deconsolidation of GF and lower Handheld product unit shipments. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. All Other operating income of $968 million in 2009 increased by $2.5 billion compared to an operating loss of $1.5 billion in 2008. The improvement in operating results was primarily attributable to $1.242 billion of income from the settlement of our litigation with Intel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Additionally, in 2008, we had a $1.1 billion impairment charge, which included a goodwill write-down of $1.0 billion and a write-down of specific intangible assets of $130 million. There were no corresponding charges in 2009. The improvement was also impacted by a $67 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets due to the write-down of certain intangible assets in 2008 and a $25 million decrease in restructuring charges. Intersegment Eliminations Intersegment eliminations represent eliminations during consolidation in revenue and in cost of sales and profits on inventory between the Computing Solutions segment and the Foundry segment. For 2009, intersegment eliminations of revenue were $1.1 billion and intersegment eliminations of cost of sales and profits on inventory were $48 million. Prior to the first quarter of 2009 and in 2010, we did not have an Intersegment Eliminations category and, therefore, the results of operations in 2009 for that category are not comparable to 2010 and 2008. 51 Table of Contents Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net, Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss of Investee The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2010, 2009 and 2008. 2010 2009 2008 (In millions, except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 3,533 $ 3,131 $ 3,488 Gross margin 2,961 2,272 2,320 Gross margin percentage 46 % 42 % 40 % Research and development 1,405 1,721 1,848 Marketing, general and administrative 934 994 1,304 Legal settlement (283 ) (1,242 ) — Amortization of acquired intangible assets 61 70 137 Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets — — 1,089 Restructuring charges (reversal) (4 ) 65 90 Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment — — (193 ) Interest income 11 16 39 Interest expense (199 ) (438 ) (391 ) Other income (expense), net 311 166 (37 ) Provision for income taxes 38 112 68 Equity in net loss of investee (462 ) — — Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 46% in 2010 compared to 42% in 2009. Gross margin in 2010 included the $69 million benefit related to the deconsolidation impact of GF. Gross margin in 2009 included $159 million attributable to the Foundry segment and Intersegment Eliminations related to profits on inventory and a $171 million benefit related to the sale of inventory that had been written-down in the fourth quarter of 2008. The factors that led to the sale of the inventory that was previously written down were the stabilization of the overall macroeconomic environment and improved business conditions in 2009 compared to the end of 2008, which led to an increase in end-user demand for PCs and, correspondingly, an increase in customer orders for, and shipments of, our products. Absent the effects of the events described above, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 45% in 2010 compared to 36% in 2009. The improvement in gross margin, as adjusted for the factors described above, was primarily attributable to an improvement in our manufacturing costs, including our utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities, and higher average selling price for microprocessors and GPUs due to a favorable shift in product mix. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 42% in 2009 compared to 40% in 2008. Gross margin in 2009 included a $171 million, or 3%, benefit related to the sale of inventory that had been written-down in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margin in 2008 included a $191 million, or 2%, benefit from process technology license revenue recorded in our Computing Solutions segment and a $227 million, or 4%, negative impact from an incremental write-down of inventory. Without the effect of the above events in 2009 and 2008, which we believe gives a more comparable view of these periods, gross margin would have been 39% in 2009 compared to 42% in 2008. Gross margin in the first half of 2009 was adversely impacted by depressed average selling price and the under-utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for our microprocessor products. However, the adverse impact of these factors on 2009 gross margin was partially mitigated by developments during the second half of 2009, including improvements in utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities and an improvement in our unit costs primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of microprocessors manufactured using 45nm process technology. 52 Table of Contents During 2009 and 2008, we recorded grants and allowances received from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany in connection with the manufacturing facilities in Dresden, Germany as long-term liabilities on our consolidated financial statements. We amortized these amounts as they were earned as a reduction to operating expenses. The amortization of the production related grants and allowances was recorded as a credit to cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $46 million in 2009 and $86 million in 2008. The fluctuations in the recognition of these credits did not significantly impact our consolidated gross margins. With the deconsolidation of GF as of the beginning of 2010, our consolidated financial statements no longer directly reflected such credits to cost of sales. However, these credits had a favorable impact on the amounts that we paid GF pursuant to the Wafer Supply Agreement. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2010, decreased by $316 million, or 18%, compared to $1.7 billion in 2009. In 2009, research and development expenses included $524 million in research and development expenses related to the Foundry segment. Without taking into account the research and development expenses attributable to the Foundry segment, which are not indicative of our ongoing performance, research and development expenses would have increased by $208 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was due to a $224 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $22 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, partially offset by a $38 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $91 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, a $68 million increase in employee benefit and compensation expense and a $64 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $33 million increase in employee benefit and compensation expense, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in product engineering and design costs due to lower material costs used in 2010. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category was primarily because of lower research and development expenses related to handheld products because we no longer develop these products. Research and development expenses decreased $127 million, or 7%, from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $1.7 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $193 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, which reflected our efforts to reduce operating expenses, and was partially offset by a $62 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses mainly incurred by GF. In 2009, GF applied for subsidies relating to certain research and development projects, and in 2008 we applied for these subsidies. We recorded these research and development subsidies in our consolidated financial statements as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy allowance were met. The credit to research and development expenses was $46 million in 2009 and $36 million in 2008. With the deconsolidation of GF in 2010, we no longer record these credits in our consolidated financial statements. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $934 million in 2010, decreased by $60 million, or 6%, compared to $994 million in 2009. Marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2009 included $116 million attributable to the Foundry segment. Without taking into account the marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to the Foundry segment, which are not indicative of our ongoing performance, marketing, general and administrative expenses would have increased by $56 million. This increase was due to a $61 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our 53 Table of Contents Computing Solutions segment and a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, partially offset by a $21 million decrease in general and administrative expenses attributable to our All Other category. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses in our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $101 million increase in sales and marketing activities, a $26 million increase in employee benefit and compensation expenses, a $15 million increase in labor expenses and a $7 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by an $88 million decrease in legal expenses following our settlement with Intel in 2009. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $15 million increase in employee benefit and compensation expenses and other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to the All Other category was mainly due to the absence of $21 million of expenses incurred in connection with the formation of GF in the first quarter of 2009. Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased $310 million or 24%, from $1.3 billion in 2008 to $994 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $216 million decrease in cooperative advertising programs due to decreased sales and cost reduction activities, a $99 million decrease in corporate sales and marketing expenses due to our cost cutting efforts and a $16 million decrease in other administrative expenses. Legal Settlements Samsung Settlement On December 22, 2010, we entered into a Patent License and Settlement Agreement with Samsung to end all outstanding legal disputes related to pending patent litigation between us and Samsung. Pursuant to this agreement, all claims between the parties were dismissed with prejudice and Samsung agreed to pay us $283 million less any withholding taxes. We received the first payment of $119 million (which represents $143 million less withholding taxes) in December 2010. The remaining amount of $117 million (which represents $140 million less withholding taxes) will be paid in two equal installments by May 31, 2011 and by November 30, 2011. In addition, pursuant to the settlement agreement, Samsung granted to us, and we granted to Samsung, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all patents and patent applications for ten years after the effective date of the Agreement to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products anywhere in the world. This settlement encompasses all patent litigation and disputes between the parties, and we do not have any future obligations that we are required to perform in order to earn this settlement payment. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our 2010 operating results. Intel Settlement On November 12, 2009, we entered into an agreement with Intel to end all outstanding legal disputes between us and Intel including antitrust litigation and patent cross license disputes. Under the terms of the agreement: • AMD and Intel agreed to a new 5-year patent cross license agreement that gives AMD broad rights and the freedom to operate a business utilizing multiple foundries; • Intel and AMD waived all claims of breach from the previous license agreement; • Intel paid us $1.25 billion; • Intel agreed to abide by a set of business practice provisions going forward; • we dropped all pending litigation, including a case in U.S. District Court in Delaware and two cases pending in Japan; and • we withdrew all of our regulatory complaints worldwide. 54 Table of Contents This settlement encompasses all past antitrust litigation between us and Intel and disputes and there are no future obligations that we need to perform to earn this settlement payment. That is, the patent cross license agreement represents fully paid up licenses by both AMD and Intel for which no future payments or delivery is required. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our 2009 operating results. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets and Impairment of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased $9 million, or 13%, from $70 million in 2009 to $61 million in 2010. This decrease was due to the reduced amortization base amount of the acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased $67 million, or 49%, from $137 million in 2008 to $70 million in 2009. This decrease was due to the write-down of certain acquired intangible assets as a result of the 2008 impairment analyses. Impairment of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets 2010 and 2009 Impairment Analyses In the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill. We considered the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. The income approach required estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates of 22% in 2010 and from 15% to 18% in 2009. Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2010 and 2009, the fair values exceeded the carrying values by a significant amount (Step 1), indicating that there was no goodwill impairment. As of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, we did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. 2008 Impairment Analyses During 2008, we concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill associated with our Handheld business unit was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $336 million. In addition, we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill assigned to the Graphics and Computing Solutions segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded impairment charges of $161 million and $461 million, respectively. We considered the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. The income approach required estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using applicable estimated discount rates ranging from 19% to 30%. The conclusion regarding goodwill impairment was also due to the deterioration in the price of our common stock and the resulting reduced market capitalization. We included the impairment charges in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. We further concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill associated with our Digital Television business unit was impaired and recorded impairment charges of $473 million related to the Digital Television (DTV) business unit, which is included in the caption “Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. The assumptions used for the assessment of the DTV business unit were consistent with those used for the Handheld business unit described above. The outcome of our 2008 goodwill impairment analyses indicated that the carrying amount of certain acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. We assessed the recoverability of the acquisition-related intangible assets or asset groups, as appropriate, by determining whether the unamortized balances could be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows. We determined that certain of the acquisition-related intangible assets associated with our Computing Solutions and Graphics segments and our 55 Table of Contents Handheld business unit were impaired primarily due to the revised lower revenue forecasts associated with the products incorporating the developed product technology, the customer relationships, and the trademarks and trade names. We measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were based on projected discounted future net cash flows. As a result of these impairment analyses, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $130 million, which is included in the caption “Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations. Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment and the license of related process technology During 2008, in conjunction with the conversion of Fab 30, our former manufacturing facility in Dresden, Germany, from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter fabrication, we sold certain 200 millimeter manufacturing equipment and licensed certain process technology to a third party. We evaluated this multiple-element arrangement and determined that each component was considered a separate unit of accounting. In addition, the transaction consideration was allocated to each unit based on their relative fair values. Based on the evaluation, we recognized a gain of approximately $167 million on the equipment sale, and a $191 million gain on the license of process technology. The difference between the $167 million gain recognized in the transaction described above and the $193 million gain shown in the consolidated statement of operations for 2008 represents gains recognized on sales of 200 millimeter equipment to other third parties. Effects of Restructuring Plans In the second and fourth quarters of 2008, we initiated restructuring plans to reduce our cost structure. Both plans primarily involved the termination of employees. The restructuring charges recorded in conjunction with the plans initiated during 2008 primarily represented severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, contract or program termination costs, asset impairments and exit costs for facility consolidations and closures. The remaining liability for these plans is related to lease obligations that will be paid through 2012. We anticipate cash payments related to the remaining liability for the 2008 restructuring plans to be $3.5 million in 2011 and $3.5 million in 2012. In December 2002, we initiated a restructuring plan. As of December 25, 2010, the 2008 and 2002 plans are substantially completed. The following table provides a summary of each major type of cost associated with the 2008 and 2002 restructuring plans for the periods presented: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Severance and benefits $ (4 ) $ 25 $ 53 Contract or program terminations — 12 13 Asset impairments — 8 18 Facility consolidations and closures — 20 6 Total $ (4 ) $ 65 $ 90 Interest Income Interest income of $11 million in 2010 decreased by $5 million from $16 million in 2009, primarily due to the absence of $4 million representing GF interest income, which is not reflected in our results of operations in 2010 as a result of the deconsolidation of GF. Interest income of $16 million in 2009 decreased from $39 million in 2008, primarily due to a 66% decrease in weighted-average interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008, partially offset by an increase in average cash balances during 2009. 56 Table of Contents Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Total interest charges $ 199 $ 439 $ 400 Less: interest capitalized — (1 ) (9 ) Interest expense $ 199 $ 438 $ 391 Total interest charges of $199 million in 2010 decreased by $240 million from $439 million in 2009. Interest expense decreased, primarily due to the absence, as a result of the deconsolidation of GF, of $153 million of interest expense incurred by GF in 2009 and a net reduction in the principal amount of our outstanding debt, which resulted in a net decrease of $77 million in interest expense. Total interest charges of $439 million in 2009 increased by $39 million from $400 million in 2008, primarily due to GF’s issuance of Class A Notes and Class B Notes to ATIC on March 2, 2009, which resulted in $92 million of interest expense in 2009. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of interest expense due to a lower principal amount outstanding under the 700 million euro Term Loan Facility Agreement related to the Dresden manufacturing facilities and our 6.00% Notes due to repurchases occurring in the second and third quarters of 2009. During 2008, we had capitalized interest primarily in connection with the construction of the Fab 36 wafer fabrication facility and equipment facilitization activities in Dresden, Germany. We discontinued capitalizing interest for Fab 36 in the first quarter of 2008 when it was in full production. There was $1 million of interest capitalized in 2009 related to GF’s construction of Fab 2, its semiconductor facility in Saratoga County, New York. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income, net in 2010 was $311 million compared to $166 million of other income, net in 2009 and $37 million of other expense, net in 2008. In 2010, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain related to the deconsolidation of GF of approximately $325 million, a $17 million gain from the sale of our marketable securities and an $8 million gain related to an earn-out payment that we received in connection with the acquisition of a company that we had invested in, partially offset by a $24 million loss related to our repurchase of $1,016 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes and $14 million loss due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In 2009, we repurchased $344 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes, resulting in a gain of $174 million, and we repurchased $1,015 million principal amount of our 5.75% Notes, resulting in a gain of $6 million. In addition, we recognized a gain of $15 million on settlement of a liability related to certain foreign currency exchange contracts, a gain of $28 million on the sale of certain Handheld assets, and a $25 million gain from a class action legal settlement with DRAM manufacturers. These gains were partially offset by a $27 million foreign exchange loss, a $17 million charge for real estate transfer taxes in connection with the GF manufacturing joint venture transaction and a $10 million charge related to the AMTC joint venture. During 2009, we also redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 7.75% Notes resulting in a net loss of $11 million and recorded other than temporary impairment charge of $3 million relating to our investment in Spansion Inc. In 2008, we recorded a $53 million other than temporary impairment charge related to our investment in Spansion Inc. and a $24 million other than temporary impairment charge related to our portfolio of auction rate securities (ARS). These charges were partially offset by a $33 million gain related to the repurchase of $60 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for approximately $20 million in cash and a gain of $11 million on acquiring the put option related to our holdings of UBS ARS, representing the fair value of this financial instrument. 57 Table of Contents Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $38 million in 2010, $112 million in 2009 and $68 million in 2008. The income tax provision in 2010 was primarily due to withholding taxes paid to the Korean tax authorities in connection with the payment we received from Samsung in December 2010 pursuant to the Patent License and Settlement Agreement as well as foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by benefits including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits, an alternative minimum tax refund on net operating loss carryback in the United States and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2009 was primarily due to a one-time loss of deferred tax assets for German net operating loss carryovers upon transfer of our ownership interests in the Dresden subsidiaries to GF plus foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by discrete tax benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits. The income tax provision in 2008 primarily resulted from increases in net deferred tax liabilities in our former German subsidiaries reduced by net current tax benefits in other jurisdictions. As of December 25, 2010, substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 25, 2010, in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. Equity in Net Loss of Investee During the time that we applied the equity method of accounting for our ownership interest in GF, our equity in net loss of investee primarily consisted of our proportionate share of GF’s losses for the period based on our ownership percentage of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares, our portion of the non-cash accretion on GF’s Class B Preferred Shares, the elimination of intercompany profit, reflecting the mark-up on inventory that remained on our consolidated balance sheet at the end of the period, the amortization of basis differences identified from the purchase price allocation process, based on the fair value of GF upon deconsolidation and, to the extent applicable, the gain or loss on dilution of our ownership interest as a result of the capital infusion into GF by ATIC. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 was allocated in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 4 $ 3 $ 10 Research and development 46 40 44 Marketing, general and administrative 37 32 23 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 87 $ 75 $ 77 During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any related financing cash flows. Stock-based compensation expenses of $87 million in 2010 increased $12 million compared to $75 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average grant date fair value in 2010 as compared to 2009. 58 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation expenses of $75 million in 2009 decreased $2 million compared to $77 million in 2008. This decrease was primarily a result of: (i) a cumulative catch up adjustment of expenses to reflect the effect of applying a higher forfeiture rate retrospectively in 2009; (ii) a lower average grant date fair value in 2009 as compared to 2008, and (iii) the forfeiture of certain stock option and RSU grants from employees transferring to GF. The decreases were substantially offset by the charges associated with the accelerated vesting of stock awards upon the retirement of our former Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board in 2009. In 2010 and 2009, we did not have employee stock-based compensation expense for discontinued operations. For the year ended December 27, 2008, employee stock-based compensation expense included in discontinued operations and excluded from continuing operations was $2 million. As of December 25, 2010, we had $19 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.71 years. Also, as of December 25, 2010, we had $99 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.93 years. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 88% in 2010, 87% in 2009 and 88% in 2008. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity As of December 25, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $1.8 billion. In comparison, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 26, 2009 were approximately $2.7 billion, of which $904 million represented GF cash and cash equivalents. Without taking into account GF’s financial position, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were essentially flat in 2010 when compared to 2009. Our debt and capital lease obligations as of December 25, 2010 were $2.4 billion, which reflects a debt discount adjustment of $103 million on our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes. This amount also includes approximately $229 million related to our accounts receivable financing arrangement with IBM, which is not a cash obligation. Our financing arrangement with IBM is described in more detail below and under “Contractual Obligations—Receivable financing arrangement.” Without taking into account GF’s indebtedness, we reduced our debt by approximately $357 million during 2010. For 2010, our adjusted free cash flow was $355 million. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculated by taking GAAP net cash used in operating activities of $412 million and adding an amount of $915 million, which represents payments made by certain of our distributor customers to IBM Credit LLC and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the IBM Parties) pursuant to an accounts receivable financing arrangement among AMD, certain AMD subsidiaries and the IBM Parties. We adjusted the resulting amount of $503 million by subtracting capital expenditures, which were $148 million for 2010. Prior to 2010, we did not calculate adjusted non-GAAP free cash flow. We have various supplier agreements with the IBM Parties pursuant to which we sold invoices of selected distributor customers. Because we do not recognize revenue until our distributors sell our products to their customers, under U.S. GAAP, we classify funds received from the IBM Parties as debt on the balance sheet. Moreover, for cash flow purposes, we classify these funds as cash flows from financing activities. When a distributor pays the applicable IBM Party, we reduce the distributor’s accounts receivable and the corresponding 59 Table of Contents debt, resulting in a non-cash accounting entry. Because we do not receive the cash from the distributor to reduce the accounts receivable, the distributor’s payment is never reflected in our cash flows from operating activities. On February 11, 2011, we terminated these supplier agreements. Generally, under U.S. GAAP, the reduction in accounts receivable is assumed to be a source of operating cash flows. Therefore, we believe that treating the payments from our distributor customers to the IBM Parties as if we actually received the cash from the distributor and then used that cash to pay down the debt to the IBM Parties is more reflective of the economic substance of our financing arrangement with the IBM Parties. We calculate and communicate adjusted free cash flow because our management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. Our calculation of adjusted free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view adjusted free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating or financing activities. We believe that in the event we require additional funding, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Over the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. However, global market and economic conditions have been challenging, with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies. While global economic conditions have improved since the first half of 2009, there can be no assurance that conditions will continue to improve, and they could worsen. If market conditions do not continue to improve or deteriorate, it may limit our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, on favorable terms or at all, resulting in adverse effects on our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. Auction Rate Securities As a result of the uncertainties in the credit markets as mentioned above, all of our ARS were negatively affected and auctions for these securities failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. While many of these securities continue to be illiquid, there have been no defaults, and we have received all interest payments as they became due. In October 2008, UBS AG (UBS) offered to repurchase all of the ARS that we purchased from UBS prior to February 13, 2008. We accepted this offer. We had the right, but not the obligation, to sell, at par, these ARS to UBS from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. During the third quarter of 2010, UBS had redeemed all of our UBS ARS without us exercising the put option. During 2010, we received $27 million upon the redemption of ARS we had carried at $26 million. As of December 25, 2010, the par value of our ARS was $66 million, with an estimated fair value of $57 million. Total ARS, at fair value, represented 3% of our total investment portfolio as of December 25, 2010. Based on the recent tender and redemption activities and the fact that the secondary market for these securities has become more liquid, with pricing generally similar to our carrying value, we classified these securities as marketable securities as of December 25, 2010, because we have the intent and believe we have the ability to sell these securities within the next 12 months. 60 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $412 million in 2010. Net income of $471 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of a $462 million loss from the application of the equity method of accounting for our investment in GF, $383 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $87 million of stock-based compensation expense, $30 million of interest expense primarily related to our 6.00% Notes and our 8.125% Notes and a $24 million net loss primarily related to our repurchase of an aggregate of $1,016 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $1,011 million in cash. These charges were partially offset by a one-time, non-cash gain of $325 million related to the deconsolidation of GF, amortization of foreign grants of $16 million and a net gain of $17 million from the sale of marketable securities. The net changes in operating assets at December 25, 2010 compared to December 26, 2009 included an increase in accounts receivable of $1,138 million, which included the non-cash impact of our financing arrangements with the IBM Parties. During 2010, the IBM Parties collected approximately $915 million from our distributor customers pursuant to these arrangements. Without considering the collection by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, our accounts receivable increased $223 million. This increase was primarily due to the introduction and sale of new products towards the end of 2010 and the timing of the related collections. Excluding the effects of the deconsolidation of GF, there was also a decrease in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other of $184 million, primarily due to the timing of payments. Accounts payable to GF increased by $55 million due to the timing of payments during 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities was $473 million in 2009, which included $1.2 billion from the settlement of our litigation with Intel. Net income of $293 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $121 million of interest expense primarily related to GF’s Class A Notes and Class B Notes and our 6.00% Notes, $75 million of stock-based compensation expense, a $28 million net loss from the sale and disposal of property, plant and equipment and an $11 million net loss primarily related to the redemption of all of our 7.75% Notes. These charges were offset by a net gain of $180 million related to our repurchase of an aggregate of $344 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $161 million in cash and $1,015 million principal amount of our 5.75% Notes for $1,002 million in cash, amortization of foreign grants and allowances of $110 million and a gain of $28 million from the sale of certain Handheld assets. The net changes in operating assets at December 26, 2009 compared to December 27, 2008 included an increase in accounts receivable of $960 million. During 2009, the IBM Parties collected approximately $535 million from our distributor customers pursuant to the financial arrangement described above. Without considering the collections by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, the increase in accounts receivable was $425 million. This increase was primarily due to timing of sales and collections during 2009. There was also a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $105 million, primarily due to lower purchases reflecting the effect of our cost cutting efforts and timing of payments. Net cash used in operating activities was $692 million in 2008. Net loss of $3.1 billion was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.7 billion of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible impairment charges attributable to discontinued operations, $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $83 million of stock-based compensation expense, $77 million of other than temporary impairment on our marketable securities, $29 million net loss from the sale and disposal of property, plant and equipment and $29 million of interest expense primarily related to our 6.00% Notes. These charges were offset by a $193 million net gain on the sale of certain 200-millimeter wafer fabrication equipment, the amortization of foreign grants and allowances of $107 million and a net gain of $34 million on our repurchase of a portion of our 6.00% Notes. The net changes in our operating assets at December 27, 2008 compared to December 29, 2007 included a decrease of $722 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflecting the effects of our cost cutting efforts and a decrease of $101 million in accounts receivable. During 2008, the IBM Parties collected approximately $221 million from our distributor customers pursuant to the financing arrangements described above. Without considering the collections by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, the decrease in accounts receivable was $322 million primarily due to a decrease in sales and improved cash collection efforts in 2008. There was also a decrease of $64 million in prepaid and other current assets primarily related to a decrease in receivables of foreign grants and allowances. 61 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion in 2010. The cash flow effect of the deconsolidation of GF was an outflow of $904 million, which consisted of GF’s cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had a net cash outflow of $147 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and of $160 million for purchases of available-for-sale securities. The net cash outflows were partially offset by a net cash inflow of $69 million from the sale of trading securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion in 2009 primarily as a result of a net cash outflow of $883 million for the purchase of available-for-sale securities and $466 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, of which $394 million related to property, plant and equipment attributable to the Foundry segment. This was partially offset by $58 million of proceeds from sale of certain Handheld assets and $14 million of proceeds from the maturity of trading securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $27 million in 2008. A cash outflow of $624 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and $95 million in connection with the exercise of our call option to repurchase the partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG held by one of the unaffiliated partners, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG, were partially offset by $343 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily 200 millimeter equipment, $216 million in net proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities and $127 million of cash proceeds from sale of our Digital Television business unit. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $484 million in 2010 primarily as a result of proceeds of $988 million from our financing arrangements with the IBM Parties, $490 million from the sale and issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes, $19 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $15 million from the exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by payments of $1,011 million to repurchase $1,016 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2010, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.5 billion in 2009 primarily as a result of proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of GF’s Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class A Preferred Shares and Class B Preferred Shares, of which $1.6 billion constituted cash proceeds to GF, proceeds of $605 million from the sale of certain of our accounts receivable to the IBM Parties pursuant to the financing arrangement described above, proceeds of $440 million from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principle of 8.125% Notes, proceeds of $15 million from the AMD China Revolving Credit Line, proceeds of $125 million from the sale of 58 million shares of AMD common stock and warrants to purchase 35 million shares of AMD common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share to WCH in connection with the formation of the GF manufacturing joint venture, and proceeds from grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of $55 million for GF’s Dresden manufacturing facilities. These amounts were partially offset by payments to Leipziger Messe of $180 million to repurchase its partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG, $67 million related to the guaranteed rate of return on those partnership interests and $10 million related to a call option premium to Leipziger Messe for the early repurchase of its partnership interests. Net cash provided by financing activities was also partially offset by $1.8 billion of payments on certain debt and cash obligations, consisting of $1,002 million to repurchase $1,015 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Notes, $398 million to redeem $390 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Notes and $161 million to repurchase $344 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2009, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was $220 million in 2008, primarily due to proceeds of $308 million from the financing arrangement with the IBM Parties described above and proceeds of grants and 62 Table of Contents allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of $161 million for our former Dresden manufacturing facilities. These amounts were partially offset by $166 million of payments on certain debt and cash obligations, consisting of $20 million for the repurchase of $60 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes, $38 million for the exercise of our call option to repurchase the silent partnership contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG held by Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG, $25 million for the mandatory repurchase of a portion of the silent partnership contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG held by Leipziger Messe and $19 million in payments for the guaranteed return on the unaffiliated limited partners’ limited partnership contributions. During 2008, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 25, 2010, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016and beyond (In millions) 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 $ 485 $ — $ 485 $ — $ — $ — $ — 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015(1) 780 — — — — 780 — 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017(1) 500 — — — — — 500 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 500 — — — — — 500 Other long-term liabilities 46 — 28 16 1 1 — Aggregate interest obligation(2) 909 154 145 126 126 99 259 Capital lease obligations(3) 36 5 6 6 6 6 7 Operating leases 176 35 30 25 24 20 42 Purchase obligations(4)(5) 419 294 61 34 18 12 — Total contractual obligations(6) $ 3,851 $ 488 $ 755 $ 207 $ 175 $ 918 $ 1,308 (1) Represents aggregate par value of the notes, without the effect of associated discounts. (2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding capital lease obligations. Also excludes non-cash amortization of debt discounts on the 8.125% Notes and the 6.00% Notes. (3) Includes principal and imputed interest. (4) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Also, purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (5) This amount does not include estimates of future purchase obligations to GF under the Wafer Supply Agreement, which we expect will continue to be material. See “Purchase Obligations,” below. (6) This amount does not include the amounts we receive in connection with our accounts receivable financing arrangement with the IBM Parties. See “Receivable financing arrangement,” below. 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 On August 14, 2007, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (the 5.75% Notes). The 5.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2008 until the maturity date of August 15, 2012. The terms of the 5.75% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 5.75% Indenture), dated as of August 14, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. 63 Table of Contents In 2009, we repurchased $1,015 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.75% Notes for $1,002 million in cash. As of December 25, 2010, the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Notes was $485 million. The 5.75% Notes will be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 5.75% Notes, into shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 49.6771 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.75% Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $20.13 per share. This initial conversion price represents a premium of 50% relative to the last reported sale price of our common stock on August 8, 2007 (the trading date preceding the date of pricing of the 5.75% Notes) of $13.42 per share. This initial conversion rate will be adjusted for certain anti-dilution events. In addition, the conversion rate will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) of AMD under certain circumstances. Holders of the 5.75% Notes may require us to repurchase the 5.75% Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) or a termination of trading (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture). Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 5.75% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 5.75% Notes. The 5.75% Notes rank equally with our existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of our future subordinated debt. The 5.75% Notes rank junior to all of our existing and future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of our subsidiaries. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remaining amount of our 5.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 On April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015. The 6.00% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015. The terms of the 6.00% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 6.00% Indenture) dated April 27, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. In 2008, we repurchased $60 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $21 million. In 2009 we repurchased $344 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $161 million. In 2010, we repurchased $1,016 million in aggregate principal amount our 6.00% Notes for $1,011 million. As of December 25, 2010, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes was $780 million and the remaining carrying value was approximately $723 million, net of debt discount of $57 million. Upon the occurrence of certain events described in the 6.00% Indenture, the 6.00% Notes will be convertible into cash up to the principal amount, and if applicable, into shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes in respect of any conversion value above the principal amount, based on an initial conversion rate of 35.6125 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 6.00% Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $28.08 per share. This initial conversion price represents a premium of 100% relative to the last reported sale price of our common stock on April 23, 2007 (the trading date preceding the date of pricing of the 6.00% Notes) of $14.04 per share. The conversion rate will be adjusted for certain anti-dilution events. In addition, the conversion rate will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture) under certain circumstances. Holders of the 6.00% Notes may require us to repurchase the 6.00% Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or a termination of trading (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture). Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 6.00% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 6.00% Notes. 64 Table of Contents The 6.00% Notes rank equally with our existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of our future subordinated debt. The 6.00% Notes rank junior to all of our existing and future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of our subsidiaries. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remaining balance of our 6.00% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. 8.125% Senior Notes Due 2017 On November 30, 2009, we issued $500 million of the 8.125% Notes at a discount of 10.204%. The 8.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning June 15, 2010 until the maturity date of December 15, 2017. The discount of $51 million is recorded as contra debt and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the 8.125% Notes using the effective interest method. The 8.125% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 8.125% Indenture) dated November 30, 2009 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. At any time (which may be more than once) before December 15, 2012, we can redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8.125% Notes within 90 days of the closing of an equity offering with the net proceeds thereof at a redemption price not greater than 108.125% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. Prior to December 15, 2013, we may redeem some or all of the 8.125% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as defined in the 8.125% Indenture). From December 15, 2013, we may redeem the 8.125% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on December 15, 2013 through December 14, 2014 104.063 % Beginning on December 15, 2014 through December 14, 2015 102.031 % On December 15, 2015 and thereafter 100.000 % Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 8.125% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the 8.125% Indenture at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 8.125% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 8.125% Notes. The 8.125% Indenture contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, from: • incurring additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt; • paying dividends and making other restricted payments; • making certain investments if an event of a default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; • creating or permitting certain liens; • creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • using the proceeds from sales of assets; • entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidating, merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. 65 Table of Contents The 8.125% Notes rank equally with our existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of our future subordinated debt. The 8.125% Notes rank junior to all of our existing and future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of our subsidiaries. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 8.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or private negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2020 On August 4, 2010, we issued $500 million of the 7.75% Notes. The 7.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning February 1, 2011 until the maturity date of August 1, 2020. The 7.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.75% Indenture) dated August 4, 2010 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. At any time (which may be more than once) before August 1, 2013, we can redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes within 90 days of the closing of an equity offering with the net proceeds thereof at a redemption price not greater than 107.75% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. Prior to August 1, 2015, we may redeem some or all of the 7.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as defined in the 7.75% Indenture). From August 1, 2015, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on August 1, 2015 through July 31, 2016 103.875 % Beginning on August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017 102.583 % Beginning on August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018 101.292 % and on August 1, 2018 and thereafter 100.000 % Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 7.75% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the 7.75% Indenture at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.75% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.75% Notes. The 7.75% Indenture contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, from: • incurring additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt; • paying dividends and making other restricted payments; • making certain investments if an event of a default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; • creating or permitting certain liens; • creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • using the proceeds from sales of assets; 66 Table of Contents • entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidating, merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. The 7.75% Notes rank equally with our existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of our future subordinated debt. The 7.75% Notes rank junior to all of our existing and future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of our subsidiaries. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or private negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. The agreements governing our 5.75% Notes, 6.00% Notes, 8.125% Notes and 7.75% Notes contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering the other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above include $11 million related to employee benefit obligations and $35 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2013 and 2015, respectively. Other long-term liabilities excludes amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 25, 2010, primarily consisted of $20 million of deferred gains resulting from the sale and leaseback of certain of our facilities. Also excluded from other long-term liabilities is $11 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in the caption “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet at December 25, 2010. Included in the non-current unrecognized tax benefits is a potential cash payment of approximately $4 million that could be payable by us upon settlement with a taxing authority. We have not included this amount in the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of any settlement with the taxing authority, if any. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 25, 2010, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $30 million for one of our facilities in Canada, which is payable in monthly installments through 2017. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2018. We lease certain manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from 1 to 5 years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 25, 2010 were $176 million, of which $7 million is accrued as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2008 restructuring plans. These payments will be made through 2012. Purchase Obligations Total non-cancelable purchase obligations, other than those to GF under the wafer supply agreement, as of December 25, 2010 were $419 million for periods through 2016. Our purchase obligations primarily include our 67 Table of Contents obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties. We currently estimate that we will pay GF approximately $1.5 billion in 2011 and $1.5 billion in 2012. We based our 2011 and 2012 estimated costs in part on our current expectations regarding GF’s manufacturing yields, wafer volumes, and demand for our products. We are not able to meaningfully quantify or estimate our purchase obligations to GF beyond 2012, but we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. Receivable financing arrangement The contractual obligations table above excludes the amounts we receive in connection with our accounts receivable financing arrangement with the IBM Parties because we are not required to make cash payments pursuant to the terms of the arrangement. As of December 25, 2010, only selected distributor customers have participated in this program. Because we do not recognize revenue until our distributors sell our products to our customers, we classify funds received from the IBM parties as debt. The debt is reduced as the IBM parties receive payments from our customers. In 2010, we received proceeds of approximately $988 million from the sale of accounts receivable under these financing arrangements, and the IBM parties collected approximately $915 million from the distributors participating in the arrangements. $229 million and $156 million were outstanding under these agreements as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively. These amounts appear as “Other short-term obligations” on our consolidated balance sheets and are not considered cash commitments. On February 11, 2011, we terminated these supplier agreements. As a result, we expect that as of the third quarter of 2011, we will transition away from making the adjustment for the distributors’ payments to the IBM Parties to our GAAP net cash provided by operating activities when calculating our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees of Indebtedness Not Recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet Fab 36 Guarantee On April 21, 2004, our former German subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 KG, the legal entity that owned our 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36, entered into a 700 million euro Term Loan Facility Agreement among AMD Fab 36 KG, as borrower, and a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, as lenders, and other related agreements (collectively, the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate Fab 36. We guaranteed the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. In connection with the consummation of the GF manufacturing joint venture transaction on March 2, 2009, the terms of the Fab 36 Loan Agreements were amended to allow for the transfer of our former 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility and its affiliated companies to GF. In addition, we also amended the terms of the related guarantee agreement such that we and GF are joint guarantors of the borrower’s obligations to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. However, if we are called upon to make any payments under the guarantee agreement, GF has separately agreed to indemnify us for the full amount of such payments. As of December 25, 2010, the total amount outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan was $170 million, and the rate of interest on the loan was 2%. This loan is repayable by GF in quarterly installments which terminate in March 2011. Effective with the deconsolidation of GF, the Fab 36 Term Loan was no longer an obligation of AMD and, therefore, it does not appear as debt on our December 25, 2010 consolidated balance sheet. However, we remain subject to the terms of the guarantee agreement until the loan is repaid by GF. As of December 25, 2010, we were in compliance with the covenants under the guarantee agreement. 68 Table of Contents AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co. KG (BAC) are joint ventures initially formed for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. AMTC provides advanced photomasks for use in manufacturing our microprocessors. In January 2010, we signed binding agreements to transfer our limited partnership interests in the AMTC and BAC to GF. On March 31, 2010, our limited partnership interests in AMTC and BAC were effectively transferred to an affiliate of GF. Concurrent with the transfer, a term loan related to BAC, a revolving credit facility for the benefit of the AMTC and related documents were amended. Toppan Photomasks Germany GmbH (Toppan Germany) leased a portion of the BAC facility from the BAC. In connection with the amendments to the BAC term loan, AMTC assumed all of Toppan Germany’s rental obligations and Toppan Germany and GF agreed to guarantee AMTC’s payment obligations to the BAC. The remaining portion of the BAC facility is leased by AMTC through a separate lease agreement. The initial guarantee agreement concerning AMTC’s rental payments was terminated and replaced with a new AMTC rental contract guarantee. Pursuant to this guarantee, we, Toppan Germany and GF guarantee AMTC’s rental obligations relating to the remaining portion of the BAC facility. Our portion of the guarantee corresponds with our exposure under the initial guarantee agreement and is made on a joint and several basis with GF. Moreover, GF has separately agreed to indemnify us under certain circumstances if we are called upon to make any payments under the AMTC rental contract guarantee. As of December 25, 2010, our joint and several guarantee of the rental obligation was $3 million. In connection with the amendment to the AMTC revolving credit facility, the guarantee agreement was amended so that we and GF are joint and several guarantors of 50% of AMTC’s outstanding loan balance under the AMTC revolving credit facility. In the event we are called upon to make any payments under the guarantee agreement, GF has separately agreed to indemnify us so long as certain conditions are met. As of December 25, 2010, the amount outstanding under this loan was $40 million and our joint and several guarantee obligation was $20 million. Discontinued Operations In 2008, we evaluated the viability of our non-core businesses and determined that our Digital Television business unit was not directly aligned with our core strategy of computing and graphics market opportunities. Accordingly, we decided to divest this business unit. We performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets during 2008. We concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and certain acquisition-related intangible assets associated with the Digital Television business unit were impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge of $473 million. During the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with Broadcom Corporation to sell the Digital Television business unit for $141.5 million. The transaction was completed on October 27, 2008. Based on the final terms of the sale transaction, we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $135 million. As a result of the decisions and transactions described above, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance, the operating results of the Digital Television business unit are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the applicable periods presented. Cash flows from discontinued operations were not material and were combined with cash flows from continuing operations within the consolidated statement of cash flows categories. 69 Table of Contents The results from discontinued operations for our former Digital Television business unit were as follows: 2009 2008 (In millions) Net revenue $ — $ 73 Expenses (3 ) (147 ) Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets — (609 ) Restructuring charges — (1 ) Loss from discontinued operations $ (3 ) $ (684 ) Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Noncontrolling Interest. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance that amends the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Additionally, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. This guidance became effective for interim and annual reporting periods after November 15, 2009. We adopted this new guidance as of the beginning of 2010, and we applied such guidance in evaluating whether we could deconsolidate GF given the changes in governance over the operations of GF that occurred effective December 28, 2009. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 25, 2010, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper and ARS. With the exception of our ARS, these investments were highly liquid. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 25, 2010, all of our outstanding debt is fixed interest rate debt. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 25, 2010, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were AAA rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. We believe the current credit market difficulties do not have a material impact on our financial position. However, a future degradation in credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. As a result of the uncertainties in the credit markets, all of our ARS were negatively affected and auctions for these securities failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. As of December 25, 2010, we had 70 Table of Contents approximately $57 million of investments in ARS. See “Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report for further information. The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 25, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total 2010Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 51 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 51 $ 51 Weighted-average rate 0.48 % — — — — — 0.48 % Variable rate amounts $ 405 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 405 $ 405 Weighted-average rate 0.21 % — — — — — 0.21 % Marketable securities Equity investments $ 8 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 8 $ 8 Fixed rate amounts $ 1,118 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,118 $ 1,118 Weighted-average rate 0.69 % — — — — — 0.69 % Variable rate amounts $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 66 $ 66 $ 57 Weighted-average rate — — — — — 1.84 % 1.84 % Long-term investments: Equity Investments $ 1 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1 $ 1 Variable rate amounts $ 29 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 29 $ 29 Weighted-average rate 0.20 % — — — — — 0.20 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,612 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 66 $ 1,678 $ 1,669 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ — $ 485 $ — $ — $ 723 $ 954 $ 2,162 $ 2,326 Weighted-average rate — 5.75 % — — 8 % 8.82 % 7.86 % 7.3 % Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Prior to the deconsolidation of GF in 2009, we also incurred cost and carried assets and liabilities that were denominated primarily in the euro. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy, which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying our strategy in 2010, we used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro and Canadian dollar. We designated these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules (refer to the discussion below related to euro currency forward contracts), and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. Upon deconsolidation of GF in the first quarter of 2010, our outstanding euro currency forward contracts no longer qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment because we no longer had direct exposure to the euro denominated forecasted spending incurred by GF that those contracts were intended to hedge. However, subsequent to the deconsolidation of GF, GF invoiced us in U.S. dollars under the Wafer Supply Agreement and these invoices reflected fluctuations in the euro because some of GF’s wafer costs are based on euro denominated costs. Therefore, our operating results and cash flows in 2010 were indirectly exposed to fluctuations in the euro even after deconsolidation. We may continue to economically hedge any material indirect euro exposure by 71 Table of Contents entering into euro currency forward contracts. However, because these contracts do not qualify as cash flow hedges, gains or losses on these contracts cannot be included in cost of sales, and mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts can no longer be deferred until the forecasted transactions occur. For the year ended December 25, 2010, we recorded a loss of $16 million related to these euro currency forward contracts in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries, primarily those denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 and related notes, which are included in this Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction We are a global semiconductor company with facilities around the world. Within the global semiconductor industry, we offer primarily: (i) x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated as an APU, for the commercial and consumer markets, embedded microprocessors for commercial, commercial client and consumer markets and chipsets for desktop and mobile devices, including mobile PCs and tablets, professional workstations and servers; and (ii) graphics, video and multimedia products for desktop and mobile devices, including mobile PCs and tablets, home media PCs and professional workstations, servers and technology for game consoles. In MD&A, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2011 compared to 2010 and 2010 compared to 2009, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. For accounting purposes, we consolidated the accounts of GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF) and its consolidated subsidiaries from March 2, 2009 through December 26, 2009. Accordingly, for this period, references in this Item 7 and in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to “us,” “our,” or “AMD” include the consolidated operating results of AMD and its consolidated subsidiaries, including GF and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview In 2011, we experienced important changes in our business. First, we continued to develop and deliver differentiated products. We launched our AMD family of APU products and experienced strong customer demand, especially for our AMD E-Series and C-Series APUs designed for low-power desktop and mobile platforms, codenamed “Brazos,” and our AMD A-Series APUs, codenamed “Llano,” for mainstream desktop and mobile platforms. We introduced a number of competitive graphics products in 2011. In July 2011, we launched the AMD Radeon™ HD 6990M graphics processor designed for enthusiast mobile gamers. We also launched the AMD Radeon HD 7970 graphics processor in December 2011, our first graphics processor based on 28nm process technology and AMD’s Graphic Core Next Technology. We also continued to focus on improving our competitive position in the server market and believe we regained momentum in the second half of 2011 with the introduction of our new multi-core AMD Opteron™ 6200 and 4200 series processors, which are based on our “Bulldozer” x86 architecture. During 2011, we continued to focus on optimizing our financial model. In November 2011, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to strengthen our competitive positioning, implement a more competitive cost structure and conduct a workforce rebalancing to better address faster growing market segments. We expect that the restructuring plan will result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $118 million in 2012. We also implemented additional efficiencies across our operations, which we expect will save approximately $90 million in 2012 operating expenses in addition to the restructuring plan savings, resulting in more than $200 million of expected combined operational savings in 2012. We intend to use a significant portion of the anticipated savings to fund initiatives designed to accelerate our strategies for low power, emerging markets and the cloud. We also focused on improving our balance sheet. We reduced our outstanding debt by approximately $200 million principal amount in 2011, and we generated non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, which we describe in more detail in the “Financial Condition – Liquidity” section below, of $528 million, a significant improvement compared to non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $355 million in 2010. However, our progress during 2011 was tempered by supply constraints related to our 32nm microprocessor products. We took steps during the course of the year to better manage our relationships with our third-party wafer foundries, and during the second half of 2011, 32nm yields and performance have improved. Net revenue for 2011 was $6.6 billion, relatively flat compared to net revenue of $6.5 billion for 2010. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2011 was 45%, a 1% decrease compared to 46% in 2010. Gross margin in 2011 included a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF, primarily related to certain GF manufacturing assets, and a charge of approximately $5 million related to a legal settlement. Gross margin in 2010 included a $69 million benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF. Absent the effects of these events, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 45% in each of 2011 and 2010. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, we changed our method of accounting for our ownership interest in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting. As a result, we no longer recognize any share of GF’s net income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. 30 Table of Contents GLOBALFOUNDRIES Formation and Accounting in 2009 On March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, ATIC, and WCH, pursuant to which we formed GF. At the closing of these transactions (the Closing), we contributed certain assets and liabilities to GF, including, among other things, shares of the groups of German subsidiaries owning our manufacturing facilities, certain manufacturing assets, real property, tangible personal property, employees, inventories, books and records, a portion of our patent portfolio, intellectual property and technology, rights under certain material contracts and authorizations necessary for GF to carry on its business. In exchange we received GF securities consisting of one Class A Ordinary Share, 1,090,950 Class A Preferred Shares and 700,000 Class B Preferred Shares, and the assumption of certain liabilities by GF. ATIC contributed $1.4 billion of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities consisting of one Class A Ordinary Share, 218,190 Class A Preferred Shares, 172,760 Class B Preferred Shares, $202 million aggregate principal amount of 4% Class A Subordinated Convertible Notes (the Class A Notes) and $807 million aggregate principal amount of 11% Class B Subordinated Convertible Notes (the Class B Notes), and transferred $700 million of cash to us in exchange for the transfer by us of 700,000 GF Class B Preferred Shares. At the Closing, we also issued to WCH, for an aggregate purchase price of $125 million, 58 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 35 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the Warrants). The Warrants are currently exercisable and expire on March 2, 2019. The shares issuable under these Warrants have been included in our basic and diluted earnings per share calculation since the third quarter of 2009 when the Warrants became exercisable. Under the Master Transaction Agreement, the cash consideration that WCH and ATIC paid and the securities that they received are as follows: • Cash paid by WCH to AMD for the purchase of 58 million shares of AMD common stock and Warrants: $125 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for the aggregate principal amount of Class A Notes, which are convertible into 201,810 Class A Preferred Shares: $202 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for the aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes, which are convertible into 807,240 Class B Preferred Shares: $807 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for 218,190 Class A Preferred Shares: $218 million; • Cash paid by ATIC to GF for 172,760 Class B Preferred Shares: $173 million; and • Cash paid by ATIC to AMD for 700,000 Class B Preferred Shares: $700 million. At the Closing, AMD and ATIC owned 1,090,950, or 83%, and 218,190, or 17%, respectively, of Class A Preferred Shares, and ATIC owned 100% of the Class B Preferred Shares and 100% of the Class A Notes and Class B Notes. In November 2009, upon the settlement of our litigation with Intel Corporation and the execution of a patent cross license agreement between us and Intel, the requirements satisfying the Reconciliation Event were met. As a result, GF’s Class A and Class B Preferred Shares vote on an as converted basis with any outstanding GF Ordinary Shares. Class B Preferred Shares. GF’s Class B Preferred Shares rank senior in right of payment to all other classes or series of equity securities of GF for purposes of dividends, distributions and upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of GF (Liquidation Event). Each Class B Preferred Share is deemed to accrete in value at a rate of 12% per year, compounded semiannually, of the initial purchase price per such share. The accreted value accrues daily from the Closing and is taken into account upon certain distributions to the holders of Class B Preferred Shares or upon conversion of the Class B Preferred Shares. Upon a Liquidation Event, each Class B Preferred Share will be entitled to receive, prior to any distribution to the holders of any other classes or series of equity securities, an amount equal to its accreted value. Each Class B Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class B Conversion Rate. Each Class B Preferred Share will also automatically convert into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class B Conversion Rate upon the earlier of (i) an initial public offering of GF (IPO) or (ii) a change of control transaction of GF. The initial Class B Conversion Rate is 100 Class B Ordinary Shares for each Class B Preferred Share converted, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Class B Preferred Shares currently vote on an as-converted basis with any outstanding Ordinary Shares, voting together as a single class, with respect to any question upon which holders of Ordinary Shares have the right to vote. 31 Table of Contents Class A Preferred Shares. GF’s Class A Preferred Shares rank senior in right of payment to the Ordinary Shares of GF and junior in right of payment to the Class B Preferred Shares for purposes of dividends, distributions and upon a Liquidation Event. The Class A Preferred Shares are not entitled to any dividend or pre-determined accretion in value. Upon a Liquidation Event, each Class A Preferred Share will be entitled to receive, after the distribution to the holders of the Class B Preferred Shares but prior to any distribution to the holders of Ordinary Shares, out of any remaining assets of GF, an amount equal to the initial purchase price per share of the Class A Preferred Shares. Each Class A Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder, into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class A Conversion Rate. Each Class A Preferred Share will also automatically convert into Class B Ordinary Shares at the then applicable Class A Conversion Rate upon the earlier of (i) an IPO or (ii) a change of control transaction of GF. The initial Class A Conversion Rate is 100 Class B Ordinary Shares for each Class A Preferred Share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Class A Preferred Shares currently vote on an as-converted basis with any outstanding Ordinary Shares, voting together as a single class, with respect to any question upon which holders of Ordinary Shares have the right to vote. Class A Subordinated Convertible Notes. GF’s Class A Notes accrue interest at a rate of 4% per annum, compounded semiannually. Interest on the Class A Notes is payable semiannually in additional Class A Notes. The Class A Notes are the unsecured obligations of GF and rank subordinated in right of payment to any current or future senior indebtedness of GF. The Class A Notes are not redeemable by GF without the note holder’s consent. The Class A Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, in multiples of $1,000, into GF Class A Preferred Shares at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date based on the conversion ratio in effect on the date of conversion. The Class A Notes mature ten years from the date of issuance. However, they automatically convert into Class A Preferred Shares upon the earlier of (i) an IPO, (ii) certain change of control transactions of GF or (iii) the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Class B Subordinated Convertible Notes. GF’s Class B Notes accrue interest at a rate of 11% per annum, compounded semiannually. Interest on the Class B Notes is payable semiannually in additional Class B Notes. The Class B Notes are the unsecured obligations of GF and rank subordinated in right of payment to any current or future senior indebtedness of GF. The Class B Notes are not redeemable by GF without the note holder’s consent. The Class B Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, in multiples of $1,000, into GF Class B Preferred Shares at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date at the conversion ratio in effect on the date of conversion. The Class B Notes mature ten years from the date of issuance. However, they automatically convert into GF Class B Preferred Shares upon the earlier of (i) an IPO, (ii) certain change of control transactions of GF or (iii) the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Based on the structure of the transaction and the guidance on accounting for interests in variable interest entities, during 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we were required to consolidate the accounts of GF from March 2, 2009 through December 26, 2009. For this period, ATIC’s noncontrolling interest, represented by its equity interests in GF, was presented outside of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet due to ATIC’s right to put those securities back to us in the event of a change of control of AMD during the two years following the date of the Closing. Our net income attributable to common stockholders per share consisted of our consolidated net income, as adjusted for (i) the portion of GF’s losses attributable to ATIC, which was based on ATIC’s proportional ownership interest in GF’s Class A Preferred Shares (17% in 2009), and (ii) the non-cash accretion on GF’s Class B Preferred Shares attributable to us, based on our proportional ownership interest of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares (83% in 2009). At the Closing, AMD, ATIC and GF also entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement), and a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA), certain terms of which are summarized below. Shareholders’ Agreement. The Shareholders’ Agreement sets forth the rights and obligations of AMD and ATIC as shareholders of GF. The initial GF board of directors (GF Board) consisted of eight directors, and AMD and ATIC each designated four directors. After the Reconciliation Event, the number of directors a GF shareholder may designate increases or decreases according to the percentage of GF’s shares it owns on a fully diluted basis. We had the right to designate three directors to the GF Board as of December 26, 2009. If a change of control of AMD occurs after the Reconciliation Event, ATIC will have the option to purchase in cash any or all of the GF securities (valued at their fair market value) held by us and our permitted transferees, ATIC can require us or the other party to the change in control transaction to assume a pro-rata portion of ATIC’s funding commitment under the Funding Agreement until 2013, and ATIC can require the other party to the change in control transaction to guarantee all of our obligations under the transaction documents. 32 Table of Contents Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement provides for the funding of GF and governs the terms and conditions under which ATIC is obligated to provide such funding. Pursuant to the Funding Agreement, ATIC has committed to additional equity funding of a minimum of $3.6 billion and up to $6.0 billion to be provided in phases over five years from the Closing. The aggregate amount of equity funding to be provided by the shareholders in any year depends on the time period of such funding and the amounts set forth in the five-year capital plan of GF. In addition, GF is required to obtain specified third-party debt in any given year, as set forth in its five-year capital plan. To the extent that GF obtains more than the specified amount of third-party debt, ATIC is able to reduce its funding commitment accordingly. We have the right, but not the obligation, to provide additional future capital to GF in an amount pro rata to our interest in the fully converted Ordinary Shares of GF. To the extent we choose not to participate in an equity financing of GF, ATIC is obligated to purchase our share of GF securities, subject to ATIC’s funding commitments under the Funding Agreement. ATIC’s obligations to provide funding are subject to certain conditions, including the accuracy of GF’s representations and warranties in the Funding Agreement, the absence of a material adverse effect on GF or us and the absence of a material breach or default by GF or us under the provisions of any transaction document. There are additional funding conditions which are set forth in more detail in the Funding Agreement. During 2009, ATIC contributed $260 million of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities consisting of $52 million aggregate principal amount of Class A Notes and $208 million aggregate principal amount of Class B Notes. We declined to participate in the funding. As of December 26, 2009, our ownership interest in GF was approximately 32% on a fully diluted basis. Wafer Supply Agreement. The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, during 2010, we purchased substantially all of our microprocessor unit (MPU) product requirements from GF. During 2010, we paid GF for wafers on a cost-plus basis. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures MPU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such MPU products to GF. In addition, once GF establishes certain specific qualified processes for bulk silicon wafers, we will purchase from GF, where competitive, specified percentages of our GPU requirements. At our request, GF will also provide sort services to us on a product-by-product basis. We will provide GF with binding product forecasts of our MPU and GPU product requirements. The price for GPU products will be determined by the parties when GF is able to begin manufacturing GPU products for us. The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider, and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply. Governance Changes, Funding and Accounting in 2010 Deconsolidation of GF On December 18, 2009, ATIC International Investment Company (ATIC II) acquired Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (Chartered). On December 28, 2009, with our consent, ATIC II, Chartered and GF entered into a Management and Operating Agreement (MOA), which provided for the joint management and operation of GF and Chartered, thereby allowing GF and Chartered to share costs, take advantage of operating synergies and market wafer fabrications services on a collective basis. In order to allow for the signing of the MOA on December 28, 2009, prior to obtaining any regulatory approvals, we agreed to irrevocably waive rights under the Shareholders Agreement with respect to certain matters that require unanimous GF Board approval. Additionally, if any such matters came before the GF Board, we agreed that our designated GF directors will vote in the same manner as the majority of ATIC-designated GF Board members voting on any such matters. As a result of waiving such approval rights, as of December 28, 2009, for financial reporting purposes we no longer shared control with ATIC over GF. Based on our fully diluted ownership interest in GF, we had the right to designate two directors to the GF Board of Directors as of December 25, 2010. 33 Table of Contents In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. This new guidance became effective for us beginning the first day of 2010. Under the new guidance, the investor who is deemed to both (i) have the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s economic performance and (ii) be exposed to losses and returns will be the primary beneficiary who should then consolidate the variable interest entity. We evaluated whether the governance changes described above would, pursuant to the new guidance, affect our consolidation of GF. We considered the purpose and design of GF, the activities of GF that most significantly affect the economic performance of GF and the concept of “who has the power,” as contemplated by the new guidance. Based on the results of this evaluation and in light of the governance changes whereby we believe we only had protective rights relative to the operations of GF, we concluded that the other investor in GF, ATIC, is the party who has the power to direct the activities of GF that most significantly impact GF’s performance and is, therefore, the primary beneficiary of GF. Accordingly, effective as of December 27, 2009, we deconsolidated GF, and during fiscal 2010 we accounted for our ownership interest in GF under the equity method of accounting. For purposes of our application of the equity method of accounting during 2010, we recorded our share of GF’s results excluding the results of Chartered because GF did not have an equity ownership interest in Chartered. The terms of the Funding Agreement and the WSA described above were not affected by the deconsolidation of GF. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party. Funding of GF Pursuant to each GF funding request from the beginning of 2010 through November 17, 2010, the equity securities issued by GF consisted of 20% of Class A Preferred Shares and 80% of Class B Preferred Shares. On November 24, 2010, we, ATIC and GF signed a letter agreement regarding future funding of GF. Pursuant to this letter agreement, the parties agreed that the securities to be issued in consideration of any future GF funding would consist solely of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares. In addition, the purchase price per Class A Preferred Share would be determined by dividing GF’s net tangible assets (derived from its most recent fiscal year-end audited consolidated balance sheet) by GF’s total number of outstanding preferred shares (assuming the conversion of any outstanding GF Class A Notes into Class A Preferred Shares and Class B Notes into Class B Preferred Shares) as of the date of the balance sheet referred to above and multiplying by 1.10. Prior to the letter agreement, the funding multiple was 0.90. During 2010, ATIC contributed $930 million of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities consisting of 444,313 Class A Preferred Shares and 617,695 Class B Preferred Shares. We did not participate in the fundings. As a result, our ownership interest in GF’s Class A Preferred Shares decreased from approximately 83% as of December 26, 2009 to approximately 62% as of December 25, 2010, and our ownership interest in GF was approximately 23% on a fully diluted basis. These contributions resulted in an aggregate gain on our ownership interest dilution of $232 million, which we recorded as part of the equity in net loss of investee line item on our consolidated statement of operations. Contribution Agreement, Funding and Accounting in 2011; Amended Shareholders’, Funding and Wafer Supply Agreements GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd. (GFS, formerly Chartered) Contribution in Fiscal 2011 On December 27, 2010, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, ATIC International Investment Company LLC, an affiliate of ATIC, contributed all of the outstanding Ordinary Shares of GFS to GF in exchange for 2,808,981 newly issued shares of GF Class A Preferred Shares. The issuance of Class A Preferred Shares to ATIC International diluted our ownership interest in GF from 23% to 14% on a fully diluted basis and from 34% to 18% on a voting basis. As the result of this dilution, during the first quarter of 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $492 million, net of certain transaction related charges, in Equity income (loss) and dilution gain in investee, net. In connection with our reduced ownership interest in GF, the number of AMD-designated directors on GF’s board decreased from two to one. In connection with this contribution, we amended and restated the Shareholders’ Agreement and the Funding Agreement. Amended Shareholders’ Agreement On December 27, 2010, we amended the Shareholders’ Agreement. Under the Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the agreement, we have the right to designate one representative to the GF board of directors, which continues for two years following the date on which our ownership in GF, on a fully converted to GF ordinary shares basis, falls below 10%. Our ownership in GF, on a fully diluted basis, fell below 10% in September 2011. Therefore, we will no longer be able to designate a representative to the GF board of directors in September 2013. Amended Funding Agreement On December 27, 2010, we amended the Funding Agreement to implement the provisions of the November 24, 2010 letter agreement described above. 34 Table of Contents Following the GFS contribution and governance changes described above, we assessed our ability to exercise significant influence over GF and considered factors such as our representation on GF’s board of directors, participation in GF’s policy-making processes, material intra-entity transactions, interchange of managerial personnel, technological dependency, and the extent of our ownership in relation to ownership by the other shareholders. Based on the results of our assessment, we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, as of the first quarter of 2011, we changed our method of accounting for our ownership interest in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method of accounting, we no longer recognize any share of GF’s net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, we review the carrying value of our investment in GF for impairment at each reporting period. Impairment indicators, among other factors, include significant deterioration in GF’s earnings performance or business prospects, significant changes in the market conditions in which GF operates, and GF’s ability to continue as a going concern. GF continues to be a related party of AMD. Our expenses related to GF’s wafer manufacturing were $904 million and $1.2 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our total expenses related to research and development activities were $79 million and $114 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011, we incurred a charge of $24 million related to a payment to GF, primarily for certain manufacturing assets of GF, which do not benefit us. Funding of GF During 2011, ATIC contributed $4.4 billion of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities consisting of 4,386,257 Class A Preferred shares. We did not participate in the fundings. As a result, our ownership interest in GF’s Class A Preferred shares decreased from approximately 62% as of December 25, 2010, to approximately 12% as of December 31, 2011, and as of December 31, 2011, our ownership interest in GF was 9% on a fully diluted basis. Since the formation of GF through December 31, 2011, ATIC contributed an aggregate of $5.6 billion of cash to GF in exchange for GF securities. Impairment of investment in GF During the fourth quarter of 2011, we identified indicators of impairment, including revised financial projections which we received from GF. The fair value of our GF investment was determined by a valuation analysis of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares, utilizing the revised financial projections. We concluded the decline in fair value is other than temporary. As a result of the valuation analysis, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $209 million, based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, our investment balance in GF after impairment was $278 million. Amended Wafer Supply Agreement On April 2, 2011, we amended the WSA. The primary effect of the amendment was to change the pricing methodology applicable to wafers delivered in 2011 for our microprocessors, including APU products. The amendment also modified our existing commitments regarding the production of certain GPU and chipset products at GF. Pursuant to the amendment, GF committed to provide us with, and we committed to purchase, a fixed number of 45nm and 32nm wafers per quarter in 2011. We paid GF a fixed price for 45nm wafers delivered in 2011. Our price for 32nm wafers varied based on the wafer volumes and manufacturing yield of such wafers and was based on good die. In addition, we also agreed to pay an additional quarterly amount to GF during 2012 totaling up to $430 million if GF met specified conditions related to continued availability of 32nm capacity as of the beginning of 2012. Under the current terms of the WSA, in 2012, we will compensate GF on a cost plus basis for projected manufacturing capacity that we have requested for our microprocessors, including APU products. However, we are currently in the process of negotiating a second amendment to the WSA, including the pricing methodology. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. 35 Table of Contents We believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. Generally, inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand for the next two quarters are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present. We perform the annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units, discounted using estimated discount rates. The key assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 15% to 30%. Discount rates are based on our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the risks associated with operations. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any. Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2011 and 2010, each reporting unit’s fair values exceeded their carrying values by a significant amount, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets including Acquired Intangible Assets. We consider quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we test for recoverability of the asset by determining whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined through discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. Significant judgment is involved in estimating future cash flows and deriving the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, and in evaluating the results of appraisals or other valuation methods. For example, in recent analyses performed, discount rates have ranged from 18% to 32%, but this may not be indicative of future analyses. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results, which also reduces the carrying basis of the related asset. The new carrying value of the related asset is depreciated or amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We also must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful life of the asset. We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. For assets held for sale, impairment losses are measured at the lower of the carrying amount of the assets or the fair value of the assets less costs to sell. For assets to be disposed of other than by sale, impairment losses are measured as their carrying amount less salvage value, if any, at the time the assets cease to be used. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the 36 Table of Contents recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Results of Operations We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. We review and assess operating performance using segment net revenues and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net, equity income (loss) and dilution gain in investee, net and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. In the first quarter of 2009, as a result of the formation of GF, we began reviewing and assessing operating performance using the following reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which included microprocessors, chipsets and embedded processors and related revenue; • the Graphics segment, which included graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue as well as revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology; and • the Foundry segment, which included operating results attributable to front end wafer manufacturing operations and related activities, including the operating results of GF, from March 2, 2009 to December 26, 2009. In addition to these reportable segments, we had an All Other category, which was not a reportable segment. This category included certain expenses and credits that were not allocated to any of the operating segments because management did not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the operating segments. These expenses were non-Foundry segment related expenses and included employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We also reported the results of the Handheld business unit in the All Other category because the operating results of this business unit were not material. We also had an Intersegment Eliminations category, which was also not a reportable segment. This category included intersegment eliminations for revenue, cost of sales and profits on inventory related to transactions between the Computing Solutions segment and the Foundry segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, as a result of the deconsolidation of GF, we no longer had a Foundry segment or an Intersegment Eliminations category. We began reviewing and assessing operating performance using the following reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which includes microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated as an APU, chipsets, and embedded microprocessors, embedded GPUs and related revenue; and • the Graphics segment, which includes graphics, video and multimedia products and related revenue as well as revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. We continue to have an All Other category, as described above. We use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending last Saturday in December. The years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 included 53 weeks, 52 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. However, the extra week in 2011 did not have a material impact on our results of operations. References in this report to 2011, 2010 and 2009 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. 37 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for 2011, 2010 and 2009. 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing Solutions $ 5,002 $ 4,817 $ 4,170 Graphics 1,565 1,663 1,167 Foundry — — 1,101 All Other 1 14 66 Intersegment Eliminations — — (1,101 ) Total net revenue $ 6,568 $ 6,494 $ 5,403 Operating income (loss): Computing Solutions $ 556 $ 529 $ 142 Graphics 51 149 35 Foundry — — (433 ) All Other (239 ) 170 968 Intersegment Eliminations — — (48 ) Total operating income $ 368 $ 848 $ 664 Interest income 10 11 16 Interest expense (180 ) (199 ) (438 ) Other income (expense), net (199 ) 311 166 Equity income (loss) and dilution gain in investee, net 492 (462 ) — Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 491 $ 509 $ 408 Computing Solutions Computing Solutions net revenue of $5.0 billion in 2011 increased 4% compared to net revenue of $4.8 billion in 2010, primarily as a result of a 16% increase in unit shipments partially offset by an 11% decrease in average selling price. The increase in unit shipments was attributable to an increase in unit shipments of our microprocessors, including APU products for mobile devices, as well as our chipset products. Unit shipments of our microprocessors, including APU products for mobile devices increased due to strong demand for our Brazos and Llano-based APU platforms. However, the increase in unit shipments in 2011 was limited by supply constraints with respect to certain microprocessor products manufactured using the 32nm technology node. Chipset unit shipments increased primarily due to an increase in overall unit shipments of our microprocessor products. The decrease in overall average selling price was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average selling price of our microprocessors for servers due to a shift in our product mix and competitive market conditions as well as sales of our Brazos APU platforms, which have a lower average selling price than our other processor products. Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.8 billion in 2010 increased 16% compared to net revenue of $4.2 billion in 2009, primarily as a result of an 18% increase in unit shipments partially offset by a 2% decrease in average selling price. The increase in unit shipments was attributable to an increase in unit shipments of our microprocessor products for mobile devices as well as chipset products, resulting primarily from an improved economic environment. In addition, chipset unit shipments increased as customers increasingly adopted our chipsets with our microprocessor products, while unit shipments of our microprocessors for mobile devices increased due to increased demand from existing and new customers for our new notebook platforms. Average selling price decreased due to a decrease in average selling price of embedded processors, partially offset by an increase in average selling price of our chipsets and microprocessor products. Average selling price of embedded processors decreased due to a shift in our product mix to lower-end, legacy products. Average selling price of microprocessor products increased due to a favorable shift in our product mix to higher end microprocessors, especially for servers, as customers continued to transition to our AMD Opteron™ 6000 series server platforms. Average selling price of our chipset products increased primarily due to a shift in product mix. Computing Solutions operating income was $556 million in 2011 compared to $529 million in 2010. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $70 million increase in cost of sales, a $45 million increase in research and development expenses and a $42 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales increased primarily due to higher microprocessor and chipsets unit shipments and the absence of a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. 38 Table of Contents Computing Solutions operating income was $529 million in 2010 compared to $142 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above and a $25 million decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a $224 million increase in research and development expenses and a $61 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales decreased due to reductions in manufacturing costs and a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Graphics Graphics net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2011 decreased by 6% compared to net revenue of $1.7 billion in 2010. The decrease was due to a 6% decrease in net revenue from sales of GPU products. Net revenue from sales of GPU products decreased primarily due to a decrease in both GPU unit shipments and average selling price. The decrease in GPU unit shipments was primarily due to lower customer demand which we believe was due in part to the disruption in the supply of hard disk drives caused by the flooding in Thailand at the beginning of 2011. GPU average selling price decreased due to a shift in our product mix to lower end GPU products. Graphics net revenue of $1.7 billion in 2010 increased 43% compared to net revenue of $1.2 billion in 2009. The increase was due to a 49% increase in net revenue from sales of GPU products. Net revenue from sales of GPU products increased primarily due to an increase in both GPU unit shipments and average selling price. Unit shipments increased due to strong demand for our DX 11® —ATI Radeon™ products. However, the increase was limited by supply constraints primarily related to constrained wafer foundry capacity in the first half of 2010. Supply constraints improved in the third quarter of 2010, and we did not experience any supply constraints during the fourth quarter of 2010. GPU average selling price increased due to a shift in our product mix to higher end GPU products. Graphics operating income was $51 million in 2011 compared to $149 million in 2010. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above and a $20 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in cost of sales. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower GPU shipments and correspondingly lower manufacturing costs. Graphics operating income was $149 million in 2010 compared to $35 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $345 million increase in cost of sales due to higher GPU unit shipments, a $22 million increase in research and development expenses and a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Foundry Foundry net revenue was $1.1 billion in 2009. Foundry operating loss was $433 million in 2009. In 2011 and 2010, we did not have a Foundry segment. All Other All Other revenue was immaterial in 2011, $14 million in 2010 and $66 million in 2009. All Other revenue declined because as of 2009, we no longer developed new Handheld products. We decided to exit the Handheld business after selling certain graphics and multimedia technology assets and intellectual property to Qualcomm in the first quarter of 2009. All Other operating loss of $239 million in 2011 included $98 million in restructuring charges, net, $90 million of stock-based compensation expense, $29 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF primarily related to certain GF manufacturing assets that did not benefit us. All Other operating income of $170 million in 2010 included $283 million of income from the settlement of our litigation with Samsung in the fourth quarter of 2010, a $30 million one-time benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the deconsolidation of GF, and $14 million of net revenue, partially offset by $87 million of stock-based compensation expense and $61 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, All Other operating income of $968 million in 2009 included $1.2 billion of income from the settlement of our litigation with Intel in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $66 million of net revenue, partially offset by stock-based compensation expense of $69 million, $65 million in restructuring charges, net, $55 million of cost of sales, $46 million in research and development expenses and $32 million in marketing, general and administrative expenses. 39 Table of Contents Intersegment Eliminations Intersegment eliminations represent eliminations during consolidation in revenue and in cost of sales and profits on inventory between the Computing Solutions segment and the Foundry segment. For 2009, intersegment eliminations of revenue were $1.1 billion and intersegment eliminations of cost of sales and profits on inventory were $48 million. In 2011 and 2010, we did not have an Intersegment Eliminations category. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net, Income Taxes and Equity Income (Loss) and Dilution Gain in Investee, Net The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2011, 2010 and 2009. 2011 2010 2009 (In millions, except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 3,628 $ 3,533 $ 3,131 Gross margin 2,940 2,961 2,272 Gross margin percentage 45 % 46 % 42 % Research and development 1,453 1,405 1,721 Marketing, general and administrative 992 934 994 Legal settlement — (283 ) (1,242 ) Amortization of acquired intangible assets 29 61 70 Restructuring charges (reversals), net 98 (4 ) 65 Interest income 10 11 16 Interest expense (180 ) (199 ) (438 ) Other income (expense), net (199 ) 311 166 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (4 ) 38 112 Equity income (loss) and dilution gain in investee, net 492 (462 ) — Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 45% in 2011 compared to 46% in 2010. Gross margin in 2011 included a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF for certain GF manufacturing assets and a charge of approximately $5 million related to a legal settlement. Gross margin in 2010 included a $69 million benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF. Absent the effects of these events, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 45% in each of 2011 and 2010. Gross margin, as adjusted for the factors described above, remained flat in 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011, unit shipments of our low-cost, margin accretive Brazos APU platforms increased compared to 2010. However, this improvement in gross margin was offset by an unfavorable mix in supply of microprocessor products manufactured using the 32nm technology node and a decline in average selling price of our microprocessor products for servers. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 46% in 2010 compared to 42% in 2009. Gross margin in 2010 included the $69 million benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF. Gross margin in 2009 included $159 million attributable to the Foundry segment and Intersegment Eliminations related to profits on inventory and a $171 million benefit related to the sale of inventory that had been written-down in the fourth quarter of 2008. The factors that led to the sale of the inventory that was previously written down were the stabilization of the overall macroeconomic environment and improved business conditions in 2009 compared to the end of 2008, which led to an increase in end-user demand for PCs and, correspondingly, an increase in customer orders for, and shipments of, our products. Absent the effects of these events, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 45% in 2010 compared to 36% in 2009. The improvement in gross margin, as adjusted for the factors described above, was primarily attributable to an improvement in our manufacturing costs, including our utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities, and higher average selling price for microprocessors and GPUs due to a favorable shift in product mix. During 2009, we recorded grants and allowances GF received from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany in connection with GF’s manufacturing facilities in Dresden, Germany as long-term liabilities on our consolidated financial statements. We amortized these amounts as they were earned as a reduction to operating expenses. The amortization of the production related grants and allowances were recorded as a credit to cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $46 million in 2009. The fluctuations in the recognition of these credits did not significantly impact our consolidated gross margins. With the deconsolidation of GF as of the beginning of 2010, our consolidated financial statements no longer directly reflected such credits to cost of sales. However, these credits had a favorable impact on the amounts that we paid GF pursuant to the WSA in 2010. 40 Table of Contents Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $1.5 billion in 2011, increased by $48 million, or 3%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $45 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment as a result of a $79 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $7 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products. Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2010, decreased by $316 million, or 18%, compared to $1.7 billion in 2009. In 2009, research and development expenses included $524 million in research and development expenses related to the Foundry segment. Without taking into account the research and development expenses attributable to the Foundry segment, which are not indicative of our ongoing performance, research and development expenses would have increased by $208 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was due to a $224 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $22 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, partially offset by a $38 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $91 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, a $68 million increase in employee compensation and benefit expense and a $64 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $33 million increase in employee compensation and benefit expense, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in product engineering and design costs due to lower material costs used in 2010. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category was primarily due to lower research and development expenses related to handheld products because we no longer develop these products. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $992 million in 2011, increased by $58 million, or 6%, compared to $934 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $42 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $20 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $41 million increase in sales and marketing activities resulting from an increase in regional marketing programs and labor expenses and a $14 million increase in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses in our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $22 million increase in sales and marketing activities resulting from an increase in regional marketing programs and labor expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $934 million in 2010, decreased by $60 million, or 6%, compared to $994 million in 2009. Marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2009 included $116 million attributable to the Foundry segment. Without taking into account the marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to the Foundry segment, which are not indicative of our ongoing performance, marketing, general and administrative expenses would have increased by $56 million. This increase was due to a $61 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, partially offset by a $21 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our All Other category. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses in our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $101 million increase in sales and marketing activities, a $26 million increase in employee compensation and benefit expenses, a $15 million increase in labor expenses and a $7 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by an $88 million decrease in legal expenses following our settlement with Intel in 2009. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $15 million increase in employee benefit and compensation expenses and other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to the All Other category was mainly due to the absence of $21 million of expenses incurred in connection with the formation of GF in the first quarter of 2009. 41 Table of Contents Legal Settlements Samsung Settlement In the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into a Patent License and Settlement Agreement with Samsung to end all outstanding legal disputes related to pending patent litigation between us and Samsung. Pursuant to this agreement, all claims between the parties were dismissed with prejudice and Samsung agreed to pay us $283 million less any withholding taxes. We received the first payment of $119 million (which represents $143 million less withholding taxes) in December 2010. The remaining amount of $117 million (which represents $140 million less withholding taxes) was paid in two equal installments in May 2011 and in November 2011. In addition, pursuant to the settlement agreement, Samsung granted us, and we granted to Samsung, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all patents and patent applications for ten years after the effective date of the Agreement to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products anywhere in the world. This settlement encompassed all patent litigation and disputes between the parties. At the time we entered into the Agreement, we did not have any future obligations that we were required to perform in order to earn this settlement payment. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2010. Intel Settlement In the fourth quarter of 2009, we entered into an agreement with Intel to end all outstanding legal disputes between us and Intel, including antitrust litigation and patent cross license disputes. Under the terms of the agreement: • AMD and Intel agreed to a new 5-year patent cross license agreement that gives AMD broad rights and the freedom to operate a business utilizing multiple foundries; • Intel and AMD waived all claims of breach from the previous license agreement; • Intel paid us $1.25 billion; • Intel agreed to abide by a set of business practice provisions going forward; • we dropped all pending litigation, including a case in U.S. District Court in Delaware and two cases pending in Japan; and • we withdrew all of our regulatory complaints worldwide. This settlement encompasses all past antitrust litigation and disputes between us and Intel. At the time we entered into the agreement, we did not have any future obligations that we were required to perform to earn this settlement payment. That is, the patent cross license agreement represented fully paid up licenses by both AMD and Intel for which no future payments or delivery was required. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our 2009 operating results. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $29 million in 2011, $61 million in 2010 and $70 million in 2009. The decrease from 2009 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2011 was due to the reduced amortization base amount of the acquired intangible assets. Effects of Restructuring Plans In the fourth quarter of 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan to strengthen our competitive positioning, implement a more competitive cost structure and conduct a workforce rebalancing to better address faster growing market segments. The plan primarily involved a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 10% and contract and program terminations. The plan also involved additional cost reduction actions that will take place in 2012. We expect that the 2011 restructuring plan will be substantially completed during 2012. We recorded a $100 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2011, which consisted of $54 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $45 million for contract or program termination costs and $1 million for asset impairments. Of the $100 million restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect approximately $52 million in cash expenditures in 2012 and approximately $15 million in cash expenditures in 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we also reversed approximately $2 million of costs associated with our 2008 restructuring plan because the actual restoration costs for vacated facilities were lower than previously estimated. In addition, we currently estimate that we will record restructuring expense in 2012 of approximately $5 million. Of this amount, approximately $4 million is related to severance and costs of continuation of certain employee benefits and approximately $1 million is related to facility site closures, substantially all of which we expect to pay in 2012. 42 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of the fourth quarter of 2011 restructuring activities and the related liabilities recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet remaining as of December 31, 2011: Severance and related benefits Other exit Related Costs Total (In millions) Balance December 25, 2010 $ — $ — $ — Charges 54 46 100 Cash payments (32 ) — (32 ) Non-cash charges — (1 ) (1 ) Balance December 31, 2011 $ 22 $ 45 $ 67 In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce our cost structure, which was substantially completed in 2009. This plan primarily involved the termination of employees. The restructuring charges recorded in conjunction with this plan primarily represented severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, contract or program termination costs, asset impairments and exit costs for facility consolidations and closures. The following table provides a summary of each major type of cost associated with the 2011 and 2008 restructuring plans for the periods presented: 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Severance and benefits $ 54 $ (4 ) $ 25 Contract or program terminations 45 — 12 Asset impairments 1 — 8 Facility consolidations and closures (2 ) — 20 Total $ 98 $ (4 ) $ 65 Interest Income Interest income of $10 million in 2011 was relatively flat as compared to $11 million in 2010. The weighted-average interest rate decreased in 2011 compared to 2010. However, the impact of this was offset by an increase in average cash balance during 2011. Interest income of $11 million in 2010 decreased by $5 million from $16 million in 2009, primarily due to the absence of $4 million of GF interest income. GF interest income is not reflected in our results of operations in 2010 as a result of the deconsolidation of GF. Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Total interest charges $ 180 $ 199 $ 439 Less: interest capitalized — — (1 ) Interest expense $ 180 $ 199 $ 438 Total interest charges of $180 million in 2011 decreased by $19 million from $199 million in 2010. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the net reduction in the principal amount of our outstanding debt. Total interest charges of $199 million in 2010 decreased by $240 million from $439 million in 2009. Of this decrease, $153 million was attributable to the deconsolidation of GF and $77 million was attributable to a net reduction in the principal amount of our outstanding debt. 43 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other expense, net in 2011 was $199 million compared to $311 million of other income, net in 2010 and $166 million of other income, net in 2009. In 2011, we recognized an impairment charge on our investment in GF of approximately $209 million and a $6 million loss related to our repurchase of $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes, partially offset by $8 million gain on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2010, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain related to the deconsolidation of GF of approximately $325 million, a $17 million gain from the sale of our marketable securities and an $8 million gain related to an earn-out payment that we received in connection with the acquisition of a company that we had invested in, partially offset by a $24 million loss related to our repurchase of $1,016 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes and $14 million loss due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2009, we repurchased $344 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes, resulting in a gain of $174 million, and we repurchased $1,015 million principal amount of our 5.75% Notes, resulting in a gain of $6 million. In addition, we recognized a gain of $15 million on settlement of a liability related to certain foreign currency exchange contracts, a gain of $28 million on the sale of certain Handheld assets, and a $25 million gain from a class action legal settlement with DRAM manufacturers. These gains were partially offset by a $27 million foreign exchange loss, a $17 million charge for real estate transfer taxes in connection with the GF manufacturing joint venture transaction and a $10 million charge related to the AMTC joint venture. During 2009, we also redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 7.75% Notes resulting in a net loss of $11 million and recorded other than temporary impairment charge of $3 million relating to our investment in Spansion Inc. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax benefit of $4 million in 2011 and an income tax provision of $38 million and $112 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The income tax benefit in 2011 was primarily due to tax benefits of $4 million from the monetization of U.S. and Canadian tax credits, a $4 million reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions, primarily due to a favorable audit resolution in a foreign jurisdiction, net of $4 million of taxes in profitable foreign locations. The income tax provision in 2010 was primarily due to withholding taxes paid to the Korean tax authorities in connection with the payment we received from Samsung in December 2010 pursuant to the Patent License and Settlement Agreement as well as foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits, an alternative minimum tax refund on net operating loss carryback in the United States and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2009 was primarily due to a one-time loss of deferred tax assets for German net operating loss carryovers upon transfer of our ownership interests in our Dresden subsidiaries to GF plus foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by discrete tax benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits. As of December 31, 2011, substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 31, 2011, in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. Equity Income (Loss) and Dilution Gain in Investee, Net During the time that we applied the equity method of accounting for our ownership interest in GF, our equity in net loss of investee primarily consisted of our proportionate share of GF’s losses for the period based on our ownership percentage of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares, our portion of the non-cash accretion on GF’s Class B Preferred Shares, the elimination of intercompany profit, reflecting the mark-up on inventory that remained on our consolidated balance sheet at the end of the period, the amortization of basis differences identified from the purchase price allocation process, based on the fair value of GF upon deconsolidation and, to the extent applicable, the gain or loss on dilution of our ownership interest as a result of the capital infusion into GF by ATIC. 44 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 was allocated in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 6 $ 4 $ 3 Research and development 46 46 40 Marketing, general and administrative 38 37 32 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0 $ 90 $ 87 $ 75 During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any related financing cash flows. Stock-based compensation expenses of $90 million in 2011 increased $3 million compared to $87 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to the acceleration of vesting of all unvested equity awards held by our former Chief Executive Officer in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of his resignation from AMD, effective January 10, 2011, and a higher number of employee stock options and restricted stock units granted in 2011 compared to 2010, partially offset by a lower average grant date fair value in 2011 as compared to 2010. Stock-based compensation expenses of $87 million in 2010 increased $12 million compared to $75 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average grant date fair value in 2010 as compared to 2009. As of December 31, 2011, we had $21 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 2.08 years. Also, as of December 31, 2011, we had $103 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that will be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.79 years. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 93% in 2011, 88% in 2010 and 87% in 2009. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity As of December 31, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances remained relatively flat at $1.8 billion when compared to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 25, 2010. During 2011, we invested $149 million in long-term marketable securities, which we intend to hold for more than one year, and do not intend to use in current operations. Our long-term marketable securities are invested in corporate bonds and money market funds that have maximum stated maturities of 2 years. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of these long-term marketable securities was $149 million. As of December 31, 2011, our debt and capital lease obligations were $2 billion, which reflects a debt discount adjustment of $75 million on our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes. The principal amount outstanding of our 5.75% Notes of $485 million matures in August 2012. We have classified this amount as current portion of long term debt on our balance sheet. We may elect to refinance the outstanding amount of our 5.75% Notes, or to purchase or otherwise retire the outstanding amount of our 5.75% Notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries. Otherwise, we will pay off the outstanding amount of our 5.75% Notes at maturity. 45 Table of Contents For 2011, our adjusted free cash flow was $528 million. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculated by taking GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of $382 million and adding an amount of $396 million, which represents payments made by certain of our distributor customers during 2011 to IBM Credit LLC and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the IBM Parties) pursuant to our former accounts receivable financing arrangement among AMD, certain AMD subsidiaries and the IBM Parties, which we describe in further detail below. We adjusted the resulting amount of $778 million by subtracting capital expenditures, which were $250 million for 2011. When compared to adjusted free cash flow of $355 million in 2010, the increase was attributable to a higher GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, which increased by $794 million, partially offset by an increase of $102 million in capital expenditures, and a decrease of $519 million in payments made by our distributor customers to the IBM Parties in 2011 as compared to 2010. Our capital expenditures increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the implementation of a financial transformation project to improve operational efficiency and also due to the acquisition of a new data center. We terminated our financing arrangement with the IBM Parties in February 2011. We did not make any adjustments to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities related to this financing arrangement in the third or fourth quarters of 2011 because there were no outstanding invoices, and we do not intend to do so in future periods. We had various supplier agreements with the IBM Parties pursuant to which we sold invoices of selected distributor customers. Under this financing arrangement, we did not recognize revenue until our distributors sold our products to their customers. Under GAAP, we classified funds received from the IBM Parties as debt on the balance sheet. Moreover, for cash flow purposes, we classified these funds as cash flows from financing activities. When a distributor paid the applicable IBM Party, we reduced the distributor’s accounts receivable and the corresponding debt, resulting in a non-cash accounting entry. Because we did not receive the cash from the distributor to reduce the accounts receivable, the distributor’s payment was never reflected in our cash flows from operating activities. Generally, under GAAP, the reduction in accounts receivable is assumed to be a source of operating cash flow. Therefore, we believe that treating the payments from our distributor customers to the IBM Parties as if we actually received the cash from the distributor and then used that cash to pay down the debt to the IBM Parties was more reflective of the economic substance of the financing arrangement with the IBM Parties. We calculate and communicate adjusted free cash flow because our management believes it is important for investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. Our calculation of adjusted free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view adjusted free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating or financing activities. We believe that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2011, anticipated cash flow from operations and available external financing will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures over the next twelve months. We believe that in the event we require additional funding, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Over the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business. We cannot assure you that conditions will improve, and they could worsen. If market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities. Auction Rate Securities As a result of the uncertainties in the credit markets as mentioned above, all of our auction rate securities (ARS) were negatively affected and auctions for these securities failed to settle on their respective settlement dates since February 2008. However, there have been no defaults, and we have received all interest payments as they became due. During 2011, we received proceeds of $21 million upon the redemption of ARS that had a carrying value of $19 million. As of December 31, 2011, the par value of our ARS was $45 million, with an estimated fair value of $38 million. Total ARS, at fair value, represented 2% of our total investment portfolio as of December 31, 2011. Based on the recent tender and redemption activities and the fact that the secondary market for these securities has become more liquid, with pricing generally similar to our carrying value, we classified these securities as marketable securities as of December 31, 2011. We have the intent and believe we have the ability to sell these securities within the next 12 months. 46 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $382 million in 2011. Net income of $491 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $317 million of depreciation and amortization expense, a $209 million impairment charge on our investment in GF, $90 million of stock based compensation expense, and $21 million of interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and our 8.125% Notes. These charges were partially offset by recognition of a one-time, non-cash gain of $492 million due to the dilution of our equity interest in GF. The net changes in operating assets at December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010 included an increase in accounts receivable of $347 million, which included the non-cash impact of our previous financing arrangements with the IBM Parties. During 2011, the IBM Parties collected approximately $396 million from our distributor customers pursuant to these arrangements. Without considering the collection by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, our accounts receivable decreased $49 million. This decrease was primarily due to timing of sales and collections during 2011. There was also a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $115 million primarily due to the receipt of the final settlement payment from Samsung of $117 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $412 million in 2010. Net income of $471 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of a $462 million loss from the application of the equity method of accounting for our investment in GF, $383 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $87 million of stock-based compensation expense, $30 million of interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and our 8.125% Notes and a $24 million net loss related to our repurchase of an aggregate of $1,016 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $1,011 million in cash. These charges were partially offset by a one-time, non-cash gain of $325 million related to the deconsolidation of GF, amortization of foreign grants of $16 million and a net gain of $17 million from the sale of marketable securities. The net changes in operating assets at December 25, 2010 compared to December 26, 2009 included an increase in accounts receivable of $1,138 million, which included the non-cash impact of our financing arrangement with the IBM Parties. During 2010, the IBM Parties collected approximately $915 million from our distributor customers pursuant to these arrangements. Without considering the collection by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, our accounts receivable increased $223 million. This increase was primarily due to the introduction and sale of new products towards the end of 2010 and the timing of the related collections. Excluding the effects of the deconsolidation of GF, there was also a decrease in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other of $184 million, primarily due to the timing of payments. Accounts payable to GF increased by $55 million due to the timing of payments during 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities was $473 million in 2009, which included $1.2 billion from the settlement of our litigation with Intel. Net income of $293 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $1.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $121 million of interest expense primarily related to GF’s Class A Notes and Class B Notes and our 6.00% Notes, $75 million of stock-based compensation expense, a $28 million net loss from the sale and disposal of property, plant and equipment and an $11 million net loss primarily related to the redemption of all of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012. These charges were offset by a net gain of $180 million related to our repurchase of an aggregate of $344 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $161 million in cash and $1,015 million principal amount of our 5.75% Notes for $1,002 million in cash, amortization of foreign grants and allowances of $110 million and a gain of $28 million from the sale of certain Handheld assets. The net changes in operating assets at December 26, 2009 compared to December 27, 2008 included an increase in accounts receivable of $960 million. During 2009, the IBM Parties collected approximately $535 million from our distributor customers pursuant to the financial arrangement described above. Without considering the collections by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, the increase in accounts receivable was $425 million. This increase was primarily due to timing of sales and collections during 2009. There was also a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $105 million, primarily due to lower purchases reflecting the effect of our cost cutting efforts and timing of payments. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $113 million in 2011. We had a net cash outflow of $234 million for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, and payments of $17 million for professional services related to the contribution of GFS to GF. The net cash outflows were partially offset by a net cash inflow of $140 million for purchase, sale, and maturity of available-for-sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion in 2010. The cash flow effect of the deconsolidation of GF was an outflow of $904 million, which consisted of GF’s cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had a net cash outflow of $147 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and of $160 million for purchases of available-for-sale securities. The net cash outflows were partially offset by a net cash inflow of $69 million from the sale of trading securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion in 2009 primarily as a result of a net cash outflow of $883 million for the purchase of available-for-sale securities and $466 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, of which $394 million related to property, plant and equipment attributable to the Foundry segment. This was partially offset by $58 million of proceeds from sale of certain Handheld assets and $14 million of proceeds from the maturity of trading securities. 47 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $6 million in 2011 as a result of payments of $202 million to repurchase $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. This amount was partially offset by $170 million of proceeds from our former financing arrangement with the IBM parties, $20 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities, and $18 million from the exercise of employee stock options. During 2011, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was $484 million in 2010 primarily as a result of proceeds of $988 million from our former financing arrangement with the IBM Parties, $490 million from the sale and issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes, $19 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $15 million from the exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by payments of $1,011 million to repurchase $1,016 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2010, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.5 billion in 2009 primarily as a result of proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of GF’s Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class A Preferred Shares and Class B Preferred Shares, of which $1.6 billion constituted cash proceeds to GF, proceeds of $605 million from our former financing arrangement with the IBM Parties, proceeds of $440 million from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principle of 8.125% Notes, proceeds of $15 million from a revolving credit line between our subsidiary in China and China Merchant Bank, proceeds of $125 million from the sale of 58 million shares of AMD common stock and warrants to purchase 35 million shares of AMD common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share to WCH in connection with the formation of the GF manufacturing joint venture, and proceeds from grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of $55 million for GF’s Dresden manufacturing facilities. These amounts were partially offset by payments to Leipziger Messe of $180 million to repurchase its partnership interests in our former subsidiary in Dresden, Germany, AMD Fab 36 KG, $67 million related to the guaranteed rate of return on these partnership interests and $10 million related to a call option premium to Leipziger Messe for the early repurchase of these partnership interests. Net cash provided by financing activities was also partially offset by $1.8 billion of payments on certain debt and capital lease obligations, primarily consisting of $1,002 million to repurchase $1,015 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Notes, $398 million to redeem $390 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 and $161 million to repurchase $344 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2009, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 31, 2011, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period (In millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 and beyond 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 $ 485 $ 485 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015(1) 580 — — — 580 — — 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017(1) 500 — — — — — 500 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 500 — — — — — 500 Other long-term liabilities 21 — 19 1 — — 1 Aggregate interest obligation(2) 714 133 114 114 94 79 180 Capital lease obligations(3) 31 6 6 6 6 6 1 Operating leases 175 36 32 29 24 17 37 Purchase obligations(4) 374 302 38 21 13 — — Total contractual obligations $ 3,380 $ 962 $ 209 $ 171 $ 717 $ 102 $ 1,219 (1) Represents aggregate principal amount of the notes, without the effect of associated discounts. (2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding capital lease obligations. Also excludes non-cash amortization of debt discounts on the 8.125% Notes and the 6.00% Notes. 48 Table of Contents (3) Includes principal and imputed interest. (4) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Also, purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. This amount does not include estimates of future purchase obligations to GF under the Wafer Supply Agreement, which we expect will continue to be material. See “Purchase Obligations,” below. 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 On August 14, 2007, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (the 5.75% Notes). The 5.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2008 until the maturity date of August 15, 2012. The terms of the 5.75% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 5.75% Indenture), dated as of August 14, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. As of December 31, 2011, the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Notes was $485 million. We may elect to refinance the outstanding amount of our 5.75% Notes, or to purchase or otherwise retire the outstanding amount of our 5.75% Notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries. Otherwise, we will pay off the outstanding amount of our 5.75% Notes at maturity. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” below, for additional information regarding the 5.75% Notes. 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 On April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015. The 6.00% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015. The terms of the 6.00% Notes are governed by an Indenture (the 6.00% Indenture) dated April 27, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. In 2011, we repurchased $200 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes in open market transactions for $202 million. As of December 31, 2011, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes was $580 million and the remaining carrying value was approximately $546 million, net of debt discount of $34 million. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the balance of the 6.00% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” below, for additional information regarding the 6.00% Notes. 8.125% Senior Notes Due 2017 On November 30, 2009, we issued $500 million of the 8.125% Notes at a discount of 10.204%. The 8.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning June 15, 2010 until the maturity date of December 15, 2017. The discount of $51 million is recorded as contra debt and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the 8.125% Notes using the effective interest method. The 8.125% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 8.125% Indenture) dated November 30, 2009 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. From December 15, 2013, we may redeem the 8.125% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on December 15, 2013 through December 14, 2014 104.063 % Beginning on December 15, 2014 through December 14, 2015 102.031 % On December 15, 2015 and thereafter 100.000 % 49 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 8.125% Notes was $500 million and the remaining carrying value was approximately $459 million, net of debt discount of $41 million. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 8.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or private negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding the 8.125% Notes. 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2020 On August 4, 2010, we issued $500 million of the 7.75% Notes. The 7.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning February 1, 2011 until the maturity date of August 1, 2020. The 7.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.75% Indenture) dated August 4, 2010 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. From August 1, 2015, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on August 1, 2015 through July 31, 2016 103.875 % Beginning on August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017 102.583 % Beginning on August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018 101.292 % and on August 1, 2018 and thereafter 100.000 % As of December 31, 2011, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Notes was $500 million. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or private negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” below, for additional information regarding the 7.75% Notes. The agreements governing its 5.75% Notes, 6.00% Notes, 8.125% Notes and 7.75% Notes contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above include $5 million related to employee benefit obligations and $16 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2014. Other long-term liabilities excludes amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 31, 2011, primarily consisted of $17 million of deferred gains resulting from the sale and leaseback of certain of our facilities. Also excluded from other long-term liabilities was $4 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in the caption “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011. This amount represents a potential cash payment that could be payable by us upon settlement with a taxing authority. We have not included this amount in the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of any settlement with the taxing authority, if any. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 31, 2011, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $26 million for one of our facilities in Canada, which is payable in monthly installments through 2017. 50 Table of Contents Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities and in some jurisdictions, we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2022. We lease certain manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from 1 to 5 years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 31, 2011 were $175 million. Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties. Total non-cancelable purchase obligations, other than those to GF under the WSA, as of December 31, 2011 were $374 million. We currently estimate that we will pay GF approximately $1.5 billion in 2012 for wafer purchases. These 2012 estimated costs are based in part on our current expectations regarding GF’s manufacturing yields and wafer volumes, and the successful conclusion of our negotiations with GF and ATIC related to a second amendment to the WSA, including the pricing methodology. Costs are also impacted by variations in yields and several other factors including our current expectations regarding demand for our products. In addition, we estimate that additional purchase obligations in connection with research and development related to GF wafer production will be approximately $71 million in 2012. We are not currently able to meaningfully quantify or estimate our purchase obligations to GF beyond 2012, but we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. Receivable Financing Arrangement In 2011, we received proceeds of approximately $170 million from the sale of accounts receivable under the receivable financing arrangement with the IBM Parties. The IBM Parties collected approximately $396 million from our distributor customers participating in the financing arrangement. We terminated our financing arrangement with the IBM Parties in February 2011 and did not make any adjustments to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities related to this financing arrangement in the third or fourth quarters of 2011 because there were no outstanding invoices, and we do not intend to do so in future periods. Guarantees of Indebtedness Not Recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet Fab 36 Guarantee In connection with the consummation of the GF manufacturing joint venture transaction on March 2, 2009, the terms of the 700 million euro Term Loan Facility Agreement among AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, as borrower, and a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, as lenders (the Fab 36 Term Loan), and other related agreements (collectively, the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) were amended to allow for the transfer of our former 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility and its affiliated companies to GF. In addition, we also amended the terms of the related guarantee agreement such that we and GF were joint guarantors of the borrower’s obligations to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. On March 31, 2011, GF fully repaid the amounts outstanding under the Fab 36 Term Loan. We were not required to make any payments under the related guarantee agreement. AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co. KG (BAC) are joint ventures initially formed for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. In 2010, our limited partnership interests in AMTC and BAC were transferred to an affiliate of GF. AMD, GF and Toppan Photomasks Germany GmbH guaranteed AMTC’s rental obligations relating to a portion of the BAC facility. Our portion of the guarantee was made on a joint and several basis with GF. GF separately agreed to indemnify us under certain circumstances if we were called upon to make any payments under the guarantee granted by us. The BAC term loan was fully repaid in December 2011, and as a result the AMTC rental contract guarantee terminated. We were not required to make any payments under the guarantee. In addition, AMD and GF were joint and several guarantors of 50% of AMTC’s obligations under a revolving credit facility. In December 2011, we were released from the guarantee. We were not required to make any payments under the guarantee. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 31, 2011, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, ARS, and corporate bonds. With the exception of our ARS, these investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 31, 2011, all of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 31, 2011, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. We believe the current credit market difficulties do not have a material impact on our financial position. However, a future degradation in credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. As a result of the uncertainties in the credit markets, all of our ARS were negatively affected and auctions for these securities failed to settle on their respective settlement dates since February 2008. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $38 million of investments in ARS. See “Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report for further information. The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total 2011Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 1 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1 $ 1 Weighted-average rate 0.51 % — — — — — 0.51 % Variable rate amounts $ 738 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 738 $ 738 Weighted-average rate 0.09 % — — — — — 0.09 % Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts $ 858 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 858 $ 858 Weighted-average rate 0.49 % — — — — — 0.49 % Variable rate amounts $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 45 $ 45 $ 38 Weighted-average rate — — — — — 1.88 % 1.88 % Long-term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 7 $ 133 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 140 $ 140 Weighted-average rate 0.85 % 1.08 % — — — — 1.02 % Variable rate amounts $ 19 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 19 $ 19 Weighted-average rate 0.13 % — — — — — 0.13 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,623 $ 133 $ — $ — $ — $ 45 $ 1,801 $ 1,794 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ 485 $ — $ — $ 546 $ — $ 959 $ 1,990 $ 2,109 Weighted-average rate 5.75 % — — 8.00 % — 8.82 % 7.86 % 7.30 % Total Debt Obligations $ 485 $ — $ — $ 546 $ — $ 959 $ 1,990 $ 2,109 52 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Prior to the deconsolidation of GF in 2009, we also incurred cost and carried assets and liabilities that were denominated primarily in the Euro. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy, which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying our strategy, from time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. During the first quarter of 2011, we reassessed our hedging needs related to our Euro foreign exchange contracts and liquidated our Euro currency forward contracts. As a result, during 2011, we recorded a gain of $6 million in other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statement of operations. We may economically hedge any material Euro exposure by entering into Euro currency forward contracts we identify in the future. We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries, primarily those denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2012 and related notes, which are included in this Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction We are a global semiconductor company with facilities around the world. Within the global semiconductor industry, we offer primarily: (i) x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated as an APU, for the commercial and consumer markets, embedded microprocessors for commercial, commercial client and consumer markets and chipsets for desktop and mobile devices, including mobile PCs and tablets, professional workstations and servers; and (ii) graphics, video and multimedia products for desktop and mobile devices, including mobile PCs and tablets, home media PCs and professional workstations, servers and technology for game consoles. In this MD&A, we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2012 compared to 2011 and 2011 compared to 2010, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. References in this Item 7 and in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” to “us,” “our,” or “AMD” include the operating results of AMD and our consolidated subsidiaries. Overview 2012 was a challenging year for our industry and for AMD. The significant macroeconomic issues and unprecedented level and pace of change occurring across the industry magnified the challenges in our business and negatively impacted our 2012 financial results. In the second half of 2012, in particular, broader macroeconomic issues and changing PC dynamics impacted demand for end-user PC products. Weakness in the global economy, a reluctance on the part of OEMs to build inventory in advance of Microsoft’s Windows 8™ launch and the increasing popularity of tablets as a consumer device of choice contributed to the challenging business environment. As a result, we faced a difficult selling environment, which adversely affected our 2012 financial performance. Net revenue for 2012 was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 17% compared to 2011 net revenue of $6.6 billion. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2012 was 23% compared to 45% in 2011. Gross margin in 2012 included the following charges, which resulted in a negative impact of 22% in 2012: a $273 million Lower Cost or Market (LCM) charge, a $703 million charge related to a limited waiver of exclusivity from GF and a $5 million charge related to a legal settlement. Gross margin in 2011 included a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF, primarily related to certain GF manufacturing assets, and a $5 million charge related to a legal settlement. Absent the effects of these events, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 41% in 2012 compared to 45% in 2011. Gross margin in 2012 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products as well as lower average selling price for microprocessor products due to the challenging macroeconomic conditions described above. Our operating loss for 2012 was $1.06 billion compared to operating income of $368 million in 2011. Our net loss for 2012 was $1.18 billion compared to net income of $491 million for 2011. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term marketable securities, as of December 29, 2012 were $1.2 billion compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2011. 41 Table of Contents As part of our strategy to respond to the macroeconomic issues and the changes occurring in our industry, during 2012, we made key strategic investments to align our business to a changing computing landscape and to position ourselves to take advantage of new opportunities in adjacent high-growth markets. In March 2012, we acquired SeaMicro, Inc. (SeaMicro), an energy-efficient, high-bandwidth micro-server company, to accelerate our strategy to deliver differentiated micro-server solutions to cloud data centers. In June 2012, we, along with ARM, Imagination Technologies, Media Tek, Qualcomm, Samsung and Texas Instruments established the Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) Foundation, a non-profit consortium established to define and promote an open standards-based approach to heterogeneous computing. In October 2012, we announced that we will design 64-bit ARM® technology-based processors in addition to our x86 processors for multiple markets, starting with cloud and data center servers. We expect our first ARM technology-based processor will be a highly-integrated, 64-bit multicore system-on-a-chip optimized for the dense, energy-efficient servers. The first ARM technology-based AMD Opteron processor for servers is targeted for production in 2014 and is expected to integrate our AMD SeaMicro Freedom supercompute fabric. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we announced a restructuring plan to improve our cost structure and enhance our competitiveness in core growth areas. This restructuring plan primarily involves a reduction of our global workforce of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We expect the restructuring action will result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $190 million in 2013. Further, to better align with today’s PC market dynamics, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA with GF. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 under the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2013 and through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, we committed to purchase a fixed number of production wafers at negotiated prices in the fourth quarter of 2012 and through December 31, 2013. GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration of this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded a $273 million LCM charge in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee will be spread over several quarters, with $80 million that was paid by December 28, 2012 and $40 million payable by April 1, 2013. For the remainder of the fee, on the same date we entered into the third amendment, we issued a $200 million promissory note to GF that matures on December 31, 2013. Under the third amendment to the WSA, we committed to purchase from GF wafers for approximately $1.15 billion in 2013 and $250 million during the first quarter of 2014. We expect to negotiate the remainder of our 2014 purchase commitments from GF in 2013. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, we continued to focus on executing our engineering milestones. We launched our next AMD A-Series APU, codenamed “Trinity,” and our next generation AMD E-Series APU, codenamed “Brazos 2.0.” We also announced our AMD Z-60 APU, codenamed “Hondo,” our lowest powered APU designed for the performance tablet and small form factor PC market. We launched our AMD Opteron™ 3200, 4300 and 3300 Series server processor platforms based on our next-generation “Piledriver” core architecture. We announced AMD’s SeaMicro SM15000 server chassis, which extends fabric-based computing across racks and aisles of the data center to connect directly to large data storage systems. With respect to our graphics products, we launched our AMD Radeon™ HD 7950 graphics processor, and our AMD Radeon HD 7700 and 7800 series graphics processors, all based on 28nm process technology and designed for enthusiast desktop gamers. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Formation and Accounting in 2009 On March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (ATIC), and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), pursuant to which we formed GF. Based on the structure of the transaction and the guidance on accounting for 42 Table of Contents interests in variable interest entities, during 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we consolidated the accounts of GF from March 2, 2009 through December 26, 2009. At the Closing, AMD, ATIC and GF also entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement), and a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA). Shareholders’ Agreement. The Shareholders’ Agreement set forth the rights and obligations of AMD and ATIC as shareholders of GF. The initial GF board of directors (GF Board) consisted of eight directors, and AMD and ATIC each designated four directors. We were no longer a party to the Shareholders’ Agreement as of March 4, 2012. Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement provided for the funding of GF and governed the terms and conditions under which ATIC was obligated to provide such funding. We were no longer a party to the Funding Agreement as of March 4, 2012. Wafer Supply Agreement. The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, during 2010, we purchased substantially all of our microprocessor unit (MPU) product requirements from GF. During 2010, we paid GF for wafers on a cost-plus basis. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures MPU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such MPU products to GF. The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider, and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply. This agreement has been subsequently modified, as disclosed below. Governance Changes, Funding and Accounting in 2010 Deconsolidation of GF On December 18, 2009, ATIC International Investment Company (ATIC II) acquired Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (Chartered). On December 28, 2009, with our consent, ATIC II, Chartered and GF entered into a Management and Operating Agreement (MOA), which provided for the joint management and operation of GF and Chartered, thereby allowing GF and Chartered to share costs, take advantage of operating synergies and market wafer fabrications services on a collective basis. In order to allow for the signing of the MOA on December 28, 2009, prior to obtaining any regulatory approvals, we agreed to irrevocably waive rights under the Shareholders Agreement with respect to certain matters that require unanimous GF Board approval. Additionally, if any such matters came before the GF Board, we agreed that our designated GF directors will vote in the same manner as the majority of ATIC-designated GF Board members voting on any such matters. As a result of waiving such approval rights, as of December 28, 2009, for financial reporting purposes we no longer shared control with ATIC over GF. In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. Based on the results of our evaluation and in light of the governance changes whereby we believed we only had protective rights relative to the operations of GF, we concluded that the other investor in GF, ATIC, was the party who had the power to direct the activities of GF that most significantly impact GF’s performance and was, therefore, the primary beneficiary of GF. Accordingly, effective as of December 27, 2009, we deconsolidated GF, and during 2010 we accounted for our ownership interest in GF under the equity method of accounting. For purposes of our application of the equity method of accounting during 2010, we recorded our share of GF’s results excluding the results of Chartered because GF did not have an equity ownership interest in Chartered. The terms of the Funding Agreement and the WSA described above were not affected by the deconsolidation of GF. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party. 43 Table of Contents Funding of GF During 2010, ATIC contributed $930 million of cash to GF. We did not participate in the funding. These contributions resulted in an aggregate gain on our ownership interest of $232 million, which we recorded as part of the equity in net loss of investee line item on our consolidated statement of operations. Contribution Agreement, Funding and Accounting in 2011 GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd. (GFS, formerly Chartered) Contribution in 2011 On December 27, 2010, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, ATIC International Investment Company LLC, an affiliate of ATIC, contributed all of the outstanding Ordinary Shares of GFS to GF. As the result of dilution of our ownership in GF, during the first quarter of 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $492 million, net of certain transaction related charges, in Equity income (loss) and dilution gain in investee, net. Following the GFS contribution and governance changes described above, we assessed our ability to exercise significant influence over GF and considered factors such as our representation on GF’s board of directors, participation in GF’s policy-making processes, material intra-entity transactions, interchange of managerial personnel, technological dependency, and the extent of our ownership in relation to ownership by the other shareholders. Based on the results of our assessment, we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, as of the first quarter of 2011, we changed our method of accounting for our ownership interest in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method of accounting, we no longer recognized any share of GF’s net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, we reviewed the carrying value of our investment in GF for impairment at each reporting period. Impairment indicators, among other factors, include significant deterioration in GF’s earnings performance or business prospects, significant changes in the market conditions in which GF operates, and GF’s ability to continue as a going concern. Impairment of Investment in GF During the fourth quarter of 2011, we identified indicators of impairment, including revised financial projections which we received from GF. The fair value of our GF investment was determined by a valuation analysis of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares, utilizing the revised financial projections. We concluded the decline in fair value was other than temporary. As a result of the valuation analysis, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $209 million, based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, our investment balance in GF after impairment was $278 million. Amended Wafer Supply Agreement On April 2, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the first amendment was to change the pricing methodology applicable to wafers delivered in 2011 for our microprocessors, including APU products. The first amendment also modified our existing commitments regarding the production of certain GPU and chipset products at GF. Pursuant to the first amendment, GF committed to provide us with, and we committed to purchase, a fixed number of 45nm and 32nm wafers per quarter in 2011. We paid GF a fixed price for 45nm wafers delivered in 2011. Our price for 32nm wafers varied based on the wafer volumes and manufacturing yield of such wafers and was based on good die. In addition, we also agreed to pay an additional quarterly amount to GF during 2012 totaling up to $430 million if GF met specified conditions related to the continued availability of 32nm capacity as of the beginning of 2012. As part of the second amendment described below, GF agreed to waive these quarterly payments, and therefore we are no longer required to pay them. 44 Table of Contents Amendments to Wafer Supply Agreement and Accounting in 2012 Second Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement On March 4, 2012, we entered into a second amendment to the WSA with GF. The primary effect of this second amendment was to modify certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2012. Pursuant to the second amendment, GF committed to provide us with, and we committed to purchase, a fixed number of production wafers in 2012. We paid GF fixed prices for production wafers delivered in 2012. The second amendment also granted us certain rights to contract with another wafer foundry supplier with respect to specified 28 nm products for a specified period of time. In consideration for these rights, we agreed to pay GF $425 million and transfer to GF all of the capital stock of GF that we owned. As a result of us receiving these rights in the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a charge related to this limited waiver of exclusivity from GF of $703 million consisting of the $425 million cash payment and a $278 million non-cash charge representing the carrying and fair value of the capital stock that we transferred to GF. Pursuant to the second amendment, $150 million of the $425 million was paid on March 5, 2012, $50 million was paid on June 29, 2012 and $50 million was paid on October 1, 2012 with the remaining $175 million paid by December 31, 2012. In addition, as security for the final two payments, we issued a $225 million promissory note to GF. As a result of the transfer of our shares of GF capital stock, we no longer owned any GF capital stock. Also, we are no longer entitled to designate a director to GF’s board, and our designated director resigned effective as of the date of the second amendment. As of March 4, 2012, we were no longer a party to either the Shareholders’ Agreement or the Funding Agreement. Third Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement On December 6, 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA with GF. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 under the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2013 and through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, we committed to purchase a fixed number of production wafers at negotiated prices in the fourth quarter of 2012 and through December 31, 2013. GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration of this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded an LCM charge of $273 million for the write-down of inventory to its market value in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee will be spread over several quarters, with $80 million paid by December 28, 2012 and $40 million by April 1, 2013. For the remainder of the fee, we issued a $200 million promissory note to GF that matures on December 31, 2013. GF continues to be a related party of AMD. Our expenses related to GF’s wafer manufacturing were $1.2 billion, $904 million and $1.2 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Our expenses related to GF’s research and development activities were $49 million, $79 million and $114 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, asset impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. 45 Table of Contents Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present. We perform the annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units, discounted using estimated discount rates. The key assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 15% to 30%. Discount rates are based on our weighted-average cost of capital, adjusted for the risks associated with operations. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any. Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2012 and 2011, each reporting unit’s fair values exceeded their carrying values, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment. For the annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2012, each reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value ranging from approximately 6% to approximately 170%. The estimated fair value of our Computing Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6%. Total goodwill relating to our Computing Solutions reporting unit was $230 million as of December 29, 2012. The reasons for the small excess of fair value over carrying value of the Computing Solutions reporting unit are primarily due to the recent global economic downturn, the changes in our industry, specifically related to the decline in PC sales, and the decline in our market capitalization. Estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a 46 Table of Contents variety of external and internal factors. Potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our Computing Solutions reporting unit include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and further decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our Computing Solutions reporting unit declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment charges. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense. Results of Operations Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. We use the following two reportable operating segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, which includes microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated as an APU, chipsets and embedded processors; and • the Graphics segment, which includes graphics, video and multimedia products developed for use in desktop and notebook computers, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers as well as revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. In addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category includes certain expenses and credits that were not allocated to any of the operating segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the operating segments. Also included in this category are amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and a charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. 47 Table of Contents We use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending last Saturday in December. The years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 included 52 weeks, 53 weeks and 52 weeks. The extra week in 2011 did not have a material impact on our results of operations. References in this report to 2012, 2011 and 2010 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for 2012, 2011 and 2010. 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing Solutions $ 4,005 $ 5,002 $ 4,817 Graphics 1,417 1,565 1,663 All Other — 1 14 Total net revenue $ 5,422 $ 6,568 $ 6,494 Operating income (loss): Computing Solutions $ (231 ) $ 556 $ 529 Graphics 105 51 149 All Other (930 ) (239 ) 170 Total operating income (loss) $ (1,056 ) $ 368 $ 848 Interest income 8 10 11 Interest expense (175 ) (180 ) (199 ) Other income (expense), net 6 (199 ) 311 Equity income (loss) and dilution gain in investee, net — 492 (462 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ (1,217 ) $ 491 $ 509 Computing Solutions Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.0 billion in 2012 decreased by 20% compared to $5.0 billion in 2011 as a result of a 14% decrease in unit shipments and a 7% decrease in average selling price. Unit shipments of all categories of products decreased. The decrease in the average selling price was primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling price of our microprocessors for desktop PCs and servers. Unit shipments and average selling price of our microprocessors for desktop PCs decreased due to challenging market conditions and the increasing popularity of tablets as a consumer device of choice, which resulted in decreased demand for our products. Unit shipments and average selling price of our microprocessors for servers decreased primarily due to challenging market conditions. Computing Solutions net revenue of $5.0 billion in 2011 increased 4% compared to net revenue of $4.8 billion in 2010, primarily as a result of a 16% increase in unit shipments partially offset by an 11% decrease in average selling price. The increase in unit shipments was attributable to an increase in unit shipments of our microprocessors, including APU products for mobile devices, as well as our chipset products. Unit shipments of our microprocessors, including APU products for mobile devices increased due to strong demand for our Brazos and Llano-based APU platforms. However, the increase in unit shipments in 2011 was limited by supply constraints with respect to certain microprocessor products manufactured using the 32nm technology node. Chipset unit shipments increased primarily due to an increase in overall unit shipments of our microprocessor products. The decrease in overall average selling price was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average selling price of our microprocessors for servers due to a shift in our product mix and competitive market conditions as well as sales of our Brazos APU platforms, which have a lower average selling price than our other processor products. 48 Table of Contents Computing Solutions operating loss was $231 million in 2012 compared to operating income of $556 million in 2011. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $136 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses, a $45 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $29 million decrease in cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments, partially offset by the $273 million LCM charge related to the fee for GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations and an inventory write-down of $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products, codenamed “Llano”. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Computing Solutions operating income was $556 million in 2011 compared to $529 million in 2010. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $70 million increase in cost of sales, a $45 million increase in research and development expenses and a $42 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales increased primarily due to higher microprocessor and chipsets unit shipments and the absence of a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Graphics Graphics net revenue of $1.4 billion in 2012 decreased by 9% compared to net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a 16% decrease in net revenue from sales of GPU products, partially offset by an increase in net revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. Net revenue from sales of GPU products decreased due to lower unit shipments, partially offset by increased average selling price. GPU unit shipments decreased due to challenging market conditions. GPU average selling price increased primarily due to improved product mix. Graphics net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2011 decreased by 6% compared to net revenue of $1.7 billion in 2010. The decrease was due primarily to a 6% decrease in net revenue from sales of GPU products. Net revenue from sales of GPU products decreased primarily due to a decrease in both GPU unit shipments and average selling price. The decrease in GPU unit shipments was primarily due to lower customer demand, which we believe was due in part to the disruption in the supply of hard disk drives caused by the flooding in Thailand at the beginning of 2011. GPU average selling price decreased due to a shift in our product mix to lower-end GPU products. Graphics operating income was $105 million in 2012 compared to $51 million in 2011. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to a $101 million decrease in cost of sales, a $60 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $41 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses partially offset by the decrease in net revenue referenced above. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower GPU shipments and correspondingly lower manufacturing costs. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. Graphics operating income was $51 million in 2011 compared to $149 million in 2010. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above and a $20 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in cost of sales. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower GPU shipments and correspondingly lower manufacturing costs. All Other All Other revenue was immaterial in 2012 and 2011 and $14 million in 2010. All Other revenue declined because as of 2009, we no longer developed new Handheld products. We decided to exit the Handheld business after selling certain graphics and multimedia technology assets and intellectual property to Qualcomm in the first quarter of 2009. 49 Table of Contents All Other operating loss of $930 million in 2012 included a $703 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, $100 million of net restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense of $97 million and $14 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets. All Other operating loss of $239 million in 2011 included $98 million of net restructuring charges, $90 million of stock-based compensation expense, $29 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF primarily related to certain GF manufacturing assets that did not benefit us. All Other operating income of $170 million in 2010 included $283 million of income from the settlement of our litigation with Samsung in the fourth quarter of 2010, a $30 million one-time benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the deconsolidation of GF, and $14 million of net revenue, partially offset by $87 million of stock-based compensation expense and $61 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net, Income Taxes and Equity Income (Loss) and Dilution Gain in Investee, Net The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2012, 2011 and 2010. 2012 2011 2010 (In millions, except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 4,187 $ 3,628 $ 3,533 Gross margin 1,235 2,940 2,961 Gross margin percentage 23 % 45 % 46 % Research and development 1,354 1,453 1,405 Marketing, general and administrative 823 992 934 Legal settlement — — (283 ) Amortization of acquired intangible assets 14 29 61 Restructuring charges (reversals), net 100 98 (4 ) Interest income 8 10 11 Interest expense (175 ) (180 ) (199 ) Other income (expense), net 6 (199 ) 311 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (34 ) (4 ) 38 Equity income (loss) and dilution gain in investee, net $ — $ 492 $ (462 ) Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 23% in 2012 compared to 45% in 2011. Gross margin in 2012 included a $703 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, a LCM charge of $273 million and a $5 million charge recorded to cost of sales related to a legal settlement. Gross margin in 2011 included a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF primarily related to certain GF manufacturing assets and a charge of approximately $5 million recorded to cost of sales related to a legal settlement. Absent the effects of the charges as described above, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 41% in 2012 compared to 45% in 2011. Gross margin in 2012 was also adversely impacted by the $100 million inventory write-down in the third quarter of 2012 referenced above as well as lower average selling price for microprocessor products. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 45% in 2011 compared to 46% in 2010. Gross margin in 2011 included a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF for certain GF manufacturing assets and a charge of approximately $5 million related to a legal settlement. Gross margin in 2010 included a $69 million benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF. Absent the effects of these events, which we believe are 50 Table of Contents not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 45% in each of 2011 and 2010. Gross margin, as adjusted for the factors described above, remained flat in 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011, unit shipments of our low-cost, margin accretive Brazos APU platforms increased compared to 2010. However, this improvement in gross margin was offset by an unfavorable mix in supply of microprocessor products manufactured using the 32nm technology node and a decline in average selling price of our microprocessor products for servers. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2012, decreased by $99 million, or 7%, compared to $1.5 billion in 2011. The decrease was due to a $60 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment and a $45 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment, partially offset by a $6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense recorded in the All Other category. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment decreased as a result of a $36 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, a $16 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $9 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $26 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense, an $11 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products and a $9 million decrease in product engineering and design costs. Research and development expenses of $1.5 billion in 2011, increased by $48 million, or 3%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $45 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment as a result of a $79 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $7 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $823 million in 2012 decreased by $169 million, or 17%, compared to $992 million in 2011, reflecting the effect of the 2011 restructuring plan and our efforts to reduce operating expenses. The decrease was primarily due to a $136 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $41 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, partially offset by a $6 million increase in corporate general and administrative expenses attributable to our acquisition of SeaMicro, which we recorded in the All Other category. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment decreased primarily due to an $111 million decrease in sales and marketing activities and a $22 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment was a result of a $24 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses and a $16 million decrease in sales and marketing activities. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $992 million in 2011, increased by $58 million, or 6%, compared to $934 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $42 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $20 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics segment. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $41 million increase in sales and marketing activities resulting from an increase in regional marketing programs and labor expenses and a $14 million increase in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses in our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $22 million increase in sales and marketing activities resulting from an increase in regional marketing programs and labor expenses. 51 Table of Contents Legal Settlements Samsung Settlement In the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into a Patent License and Settlement Agreement with Samsung to end all outstanding legal disputes related to pending patent litigation between us and Samsung. Pursuant to this agreement, all claims between the parties were dismissed with prejudice and Samsung agreed to pay us $283 million less any withholding taxes. We received the first payment of $119 million (which represents $143 million less withholding taxes) in December 2010. The remaining amount of $117 million (which represents $140 million less withholding taxes) was paid in two equal installments in May 2011 and in November 2011. In addition, pursuant to the settlement agreement, Samsung granted us, and we granted to Samsung, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all patents and patent applications for ten years after the effective date of the Agreement to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products anywhere in the world. This settlement encompassed all patent litigation and disputes between the parties. At the time we entered into the Agreement, we did not have any future obligations that we were required to perform in order to earn this settlement payment. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2010. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $14 million in 2012, $29 million in 2011 and $61 million in 2010. The decrease from 2011 to 2012 was due to the reduced amortization base amount of the acquired intangible assets, offset by the acquisition of SeaMicro intangible assets in 2012. The decrease from 2010 to 2011 was due to the reduced amortization base amount of acquired intangible assets. Effects of Restructuring Plans 2012 Restructuring Plan In the fourth quarter of 2012, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve our cost structure and to strengthen our competitiveness in core growth areas. The plan primarily involves a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We recorded restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million. Substantially all of the restructuring expense is related to severance. Of the total restructuring expense, approximately $46 million related to cash payments in the fourth quarter of 2012, with the remaining $41 million related to anticipated cash payments in 2013. The non-cash portion of the restructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. We plan to substantially complete the plan by the end of the first quarter of 2013. We are currently evaluating further facility consolidations, and depending on the outcome of such evaluation, we may incur additional restructuring charges, which may be material. 2011 Restructuring Plan In the fourth quarter of 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan to strengthen our competitive positioning, implement a more competitive cost structure and conduct a workforce rebalancing to better address faster growing market segments. The plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 13% and contract and program terminations. We recorded a $100 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 and an additional $8 million restructuring charge in 2012, which consisted of $62 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $46 million for contract or program termination costs and $1 million for asset impairments. The plan was substantially completed as of the end of the first quarter of 2012. 52 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of the activity related to the 2012 and 2011 restructuring plans and the remaining related liabilities recorded in “Other current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2012: Severanceand relatedbenefits Other exitRelatedCosts Total (In millions) Balance at December 25, 2010 $ — $ — $ — Charges 54 46 100 Cash payments (32 ) — (32 ) Non-cash charges — (1 ) (1 ) Balance at December 31, 2011 22 45 67 Charges 95 5 100 Cash payments (76 ) (29 ) (105 ) Non-cash charges — (4 ) (4 ) Balance at December 29, 2012 $ 41 $ 17 $ 58 2008 Restructuring Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce our cost structure, which was substantially completed in 2009. In 2011, we reversed approximately $2 million of costs associated with the 2008 restructuring plan because the actual restoration costs for vacated facilities were lower than previously estimated. In 2010, we reversed approximately $4 million of costs associated with the 2008 restructuring plan because the actual severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits were lower than previously estimated. The following table provides a summary of each major type of cost associated with the 2012, 2011 and 2008 restructuring plans for the periods presented: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Severance and benefits $ 95 $ 54 $ (4 ) Contract or program terminations — 45 — Asset impairments 4 1 — Facility consolidations and closures 1 (2 ) — Total $ 100 $ 98 $ (4 ) Interest Income Interest income was $8 million in 2012 compared to $10 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate during 2012. Interest income of $10 million in 2011 was relatively flat as compared to $11 million in 2010. The weighted-average interest rate decreased in 2011 compared to 2010. However, the impact of this was offset by an increase in average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance during 2011. Interest Expense Interest expense was $175 million in 2012 compared to $180 million in 2011 and $199 million in 2010. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the net reduction in the principal amount of our outstanding debt. 53 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income, net in 2012 was $6 million compared to $199 million of other expense, net in 2011 and $311 million of other income, net in 2010. In 2012, we recognized $6 million of other income, net primarily due to other income recorded in the third quarter of 2012, partially offset by a $5 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a $4 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to one of our auction rate securities (ARS) investments. In 2011, we recognized an impairment charge on our investment in GF of approximately $209 million and a $6 million loss related to our repurchase of $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes), partially offset by $8 million gain on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2010, we recognized a non-cash gain related to the deconsolidation of GF of approximately $325 million, a $17 million gain from the sale of our marketable securities and an $8 million gain related to an earn-out payment that we received in connection with the acquisition of a company that we had invested in, partially offset by a $24 million loss related to our repurchase of $1,016 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes and $14 million loss due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax benefit of $34 million and $4 million in 2012 and 2011 and an income tax provision of $38 million in 2010. The income tax benefit in 2012 was primarily due to a tax benefit of $36 million relating to the SeaMicro acquisition, a $1 million tax benefit for the tax effects of items credited directly to other comprehensive income, a $2 million tax benefit for Canadian co-op tax credits and a $9 million tax benefit associated with the successful negotiation of a tax holiday in a foreign jurisdiction net of $14 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations. The income tax benefit in 2011 was primarily due to tax benefits of $4 million from the monetization of U.S. and Canadian tax credits, a $4 million reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions, primarily due to a favorable audit resolution in a foreign jurisdiction, net of $4 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations. The income tax provision in 2010 was primarily due to withholding taxes paid to the Korean tax authorities in connection with the payment we received from Samsung in December 2010 pursuant to the Patent License and Settlement Agreement as well as foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits, an alternative minimum tax refund on net operating loss carryback in the United States and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions. As of December 29, 2012, substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 29, 2012, in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. On January 2, 2013 the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Act) was passed into law. The Act included a retroactive extension of the U.S. research credit for 2012. Since the effects of tax law changes are recognized in the first period which includes the date of enactment, the Act had no impact on our 2012 tax provision. The impact on our 2013 tax provision will be immaterial due to the valuation allowance. 54 Table of Contents Equity Income (Loss) and Dilution Gain in Investee, Net From December 27, 2009 to December 25, 2010, the period during which we applied the equity method of accounting for our ownership interest in GF, our equity in net loss of investee primarily consisted of our proportionate share of GF’s losses for the period based on our ownership percentage of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares, our portion of the non-cash accretion on GF’s Class B Preferred Shares, the elimination of intercompany profit, reflecting the mark-up on inventory that remained on our consolidated balance sheet at the end of the period, the amortization of basis differences identified from the purchase price allocation process, based on the fair value of GF upon deconsolidation, and, to the extent applicable, the gain or loss on dilution of our ownership interest as a result of the capital contributions into GF by ATIC. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 was allocated in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 8 $ 6 $ 4 Research and development 52 46 46 Marketing, general and administrative 37 38 37 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0 $ 97 $ 90 $ 87 During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any related financing cash flows. Stock-based compensation expense of $97 million in 2012 increased by $7 million as compared to $90 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the additional expense related to the equity grants made in connection with our acquisition of SeaMicro and an increase in the number of employee stock options and restricted stock units that we granted, partially offset by the absence of a charge related to the acceleration of vesting of all unvested equity incentive awards held by our former Chief Executive Officer in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of his resignation from AMD, effective January 10, 2011 and a lower weighted-average estimated grant date fair value in 2012 as compared to 2011. Stock-based compensation expenses of $90 million in 2011 increased $3 million compared to $87 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to the acceleration of vesting of all unvested equity awards held by our former Chief Executive Officer in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of his resignation from AMD, effective January 10, 2011, and an increase in the number of employee stock options and restricted stock units that we granted in 2011 compared to 2010, partially offset by a lower weighted-average estimated grant date fair value in 2011 as compared to 2010. As of December 29, 2012, we had $44 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 2.20 years. Also, as of December 29, 2012, we had $97 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.97 years. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 92% in 2012, 93% in 2011, and 88% in 2010. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars. 55 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity As of December 29, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.0 billion decreased by $763 million compared to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2011. During 2012, we made net cash payments of $281 million to acquire SeaMicro, $250 million related to the limited waiver of exclusively from GF, $105 million related to restructuring activities and $80 million related to GF’s waiver of a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. The percentage of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the United States was 94% as of December 29, 2012. During 2012, we invested an additional $32 million in long-term marketable securities, which we intend to hold for more than one year and do not intend to use in current operations. Our long-term marketable securities are invested in corporate bonds and money market funds that have maximum stated maturities of 2 years. As of December 29, 2012, the fair value of these long-term marketable securities was $181 million. All of the long-term marketable securities were held in the United States. As of December 29, 2012, our debt and capital lease obligations were $2.04 billion, which reflects a debt discount adjustment of $60 million on our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (8.125% Notes). In the third quarter of 2012, we repaid in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest on our 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (5.75% Notes), of approximately $499 million, and issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes). For 2012, our net cash used in operating activities was $338 million and our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was negative $471 million. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculated in 2012 by taking GAAP net cash used in operating activities of $338 million for 2012 and subtracting capital expenditures, which were $133 million for 2012. For 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $382 million and our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $528 million. For 2011, we calculated non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow by taking GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of $382 million for 2011 and adding $396 million, which represented payments made by certain of our distributor customers during 2011 to IBM Credit LLC and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the IBM Parties) pursuant to our former accounts receivable financing arrangement, which we describe in further detail below. Then we adjusted the resulting amount of $778 million by subtracting capital expenditures, which were $250 million for 2011. Compared to our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $528 million for 2011, the decrease in our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow for 2012 was primarily due to the fact that we did not generate cash flow from operating activities in 2012; instead we used $338 million of net cash for operating activities. The decrease was partially offset by a $117 million decrease in capital expenditures. We had various supplier agreements with the IBM Parties pursuant to which we sold invoices of selected distributor customers. Under this financing arrangement, we did not recognize revenue until our distributors sold our products to their customers. Under GAAP, we classified funds received from the IBM Parties as debt on the balance sheet. Moreover, for cash flow purposes, we classified these funds as cash flows from financing activities. When a distributor paid the applicable IBM Party, we reduced the distributor’s accounts receivable and the corresponding debt resulted in a non-cash accounting entry. Because we did not receive the cash from the distributor to reduce the accounts receivable, the distributor’s payment was not reflected in our cash flows from operating activities. Generally, under GAAP, the reduction in accounts receivable is assumed to be a source of operating cash flow. Therefore, we believe that treating the payments from our distributor customers to the IBM Parties as if we actually received the cash from the distributor and then used that cash to pay down the debt to the IBM Parties was more reflective of the economic substance of the financing arrangement with the IBM Parties. We terminated our financing arrangement with the IBM Parties in February 2011. Commencing in the third quarter of 2011, we no longer make the adjustment for distributors’ payments to the IBM Parties to our GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities when calculating our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow. 56 Table of Contents We calculate and communicate adjusted free cash flow because our management believes it is important for investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. Our calculation of adjusted free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view adjusted free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating or financing activities. We believe that the challenging macroeconomic conditions that we experienced in the second half of 2012 will continue during the first half of 2013. In light of the macroeconomic environment, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our operating expenses and better position us competitively. With our restructuring and available external financing, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures over the next twelve months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Over the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We cannot assure you that macroeconomic conditions will improve, and they could worsen. If market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities. Auction Rate Securities As a result of the uncertainties in the credit markets, all of our auction rate securities (ARS) were negatively affected, and since February 2008, auctions for these securities failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. However, there have been no defaults, and we have received all interest payments as they became due. During 2012, we did not realize any gain or loss on sales of available-for-sale securities of approximately $6 million, and we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $4 million during the fourth quarter. As of December 29, 2012, the par value of our ARS was $37 million, with an estimated fair value of $28 million. Total ARS, at fair value, represented 3% of our total investment portfolio as of December 29, 2012. Based on the recent tender and redemption activities and the fact that the secondary market for these securities has become more liquid, with pricing generally similar to our carrying value, we classified these securities as marketable securities as of December 29, 2012. We have the intent and believe we have the ability to sell these securities within the next 12 months. During the first quarter to date, we sold $13 million of our ARS for an insignificant loss. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $338 million in 2012. A net loss of $1,183 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of a $278 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, $260 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $97 million of stock-based compensation expense and $23 million of non-cash interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes. These charges were partially offset by a benefit of $40 million for deferred income taxes. The net changes in operating assets as of 57 Table of Contents December 29, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 included a decrease in accounts receivable of $290 million and an increase in inventories of $83 million, which were primarily due to lower sales during 2012. During 2012, our payable to GF, which included all amounts that we owe to GF, increased by $277 million. The increase was due to cash obligations of $240 million related to the third amendment to the WSA and $175 million related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, offset by a decrease of $138 million in the amount of billings related to wafer purchases. Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other decreased by $232 million primarily due to a $94 million decrease in accrued liabilities, a $92 million decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities, a $23 million decrease in other liabilities, a $15 million decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors and a $6 million decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. Net cash provided by operating activities was $382 million in 2011. Net income of $491 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $317 million of depreciation and amortization expense, a $209 million impairment charge on our investment in GF, $90 million of stock based compensation expense, and $21 million of non-cash interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and our 8.125% Notes. These charges were partially offset by recognition of a non-cash gain of $492 million due to the dilution of our equity interest in GF. The net changes in operating assets at December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010 included an increase in accounts receivable of $347 million, which included the non-cash impact of our previous financing arrangements with the IBM Parties. During 2011, the IBM Parties collected approximately $396 million from our distributor customers pursuant to these arrangements. Without considering the collection by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, our accounts receivable decreased $49 million. This decrease was primarily due to timing of sales and collections during 2011. There was also a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $115 million primarily due to the receipt of the final settlement payment from Samsung of $117 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $412 million in 2010. Net income of $471 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of a $462 million loss from the application of the equity method of accounting for our investment in GF, $383 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $87 million of stock-based compensation expense, $30 million of interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and our 8.125% Notes and a $24 million net loss related to our repurchase of an aggregate of $1,016 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $1,011 million in cash. These charges were partially offset by a non-cash gain of $325 million related to the deconsolidation of GF, amortization of foreign grants of $16 million and a net gain of $17 million from the sale of marketable securities. The net changes in operating assets at December 25, 2010 compared to December 26, 2009 included an increase in accounts receivable of $1,138 million, which included the non-cash impact of our financing arrangement with the IBM Parties. During 2010, the IBM Parties collected approximately $915 million from our distributor customers pursuant to these arrangements. Without considering the collection by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, our accounts receivable increased $223 million. This increase was primarily due to the introduction and sale of new products towards the end of 2010 and the timing of the related collections. Excluding the effects of the deconsolidation of GF, there was also a decrease in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other of $184 million, primarily due to the timing of payments. Accounts payable to GF increased by $55 million due to the timing of payments during 2010. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $19 million in 2012. We had a net cash inflow of $404 million from purchase, sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a net cash outflow of $281 million related to the acquisition of SeaMicro, a cash outflow of $133 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and a cash outflow of $9 million related to other investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $113 million in 2011. We had a net cash outflow of $234 million for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, and payments of $17 million for professional services related to the contribution of GFS to GF. The net cash outflows were partially offset by a net cash inflow of $140 million from purchase, sale, and maturity of available-for-sale securities. 58 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $1,123 million in 2010. The cash flow effect of the deconsolidation of GF was an outflow of $904 million, which consisted of GF’s cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had a net cash outflow of $147 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and of $160 million for purchases of available-for-sale securities. The net cash outflows were partially offset by a net cash inflow of $69 million from the sale of trading securities. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $37 million in 2012 primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of our 7.50% Notes of $491 million, $23 million from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $14 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan, partially offset by our repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest on our 5.75% Notes and repayment of capital lease obligations of $489 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $6 million in 2011 as a result of payments of $202 million to repurchase $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. This amount was partially offset by $170 million of proceeds from our former financing arrangement with the IBM Parties, $20 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities, and $18 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan. Net cash provided by financing activities was $484 million in 2010 primarily as a result of proceeds of $988 million from our former financing arrangement with the IBM Parties, $490 million from the sale and issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes, $19 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $15 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan. These amounts were partially offset by payments of $1,011 million to repurchase $1,016 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows for these periods. 59 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 29, 2012, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period (In millions) Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018and thereafter 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015(1) $ 580 $ — $ — $ 580 $ — $ — $ — 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017(1) 500 — — — — 500 — 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 500 — — — — — 500 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 500 500 Other long-term liabilities 13 — 12 — — — 1 Aggregate interest obligation(2) 937 152 152 128 117 115 273 Capital lease obligations(3) 25 6 6 6 6 1 — Operating leases 160 37 34 28 21 18 22 Purchase obligations(4) 299 266 21 12 — — — Obligations to GF(5) 1,815 1,565 250 — — — — Total contractual obligations $ 5,329 $ 2,026 $ 475 $ 754 $ 144 $ 634 $ 1,296 (1) Represents aggregate principal amount of the notes, without the effect of associated discounts.

Also excludes non-cash amortization of debt discounts on the 8.125% Notes and the 6.00% Notes. (3) Includes principal and imputed interest. (4) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (5) This amount includes all our contractual obligations to GF. 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 On April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Notes. The 6.00% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015. The terms of the 6.00% Notes are governed by an indenture (the 6.00% Indenture) dated April 27, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. As of December 29, 2012, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes was $580 million and the remaining carrying value was approximately $555 million, net of debt discount of $25 million. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” below, for additional information regarding the 6.00% Notes. 8.125% Senior Notes Due 2017 On November 30, 2009, we issued $500 million of the 8.125% Notes at a discount of 10.204%. The 8.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning June 15, 2010 until the maturity date of December 15, 2017. The discount of $51 million is recorded as contra debt and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the 8.125% Notes using the effective interest method. The 8.125% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 8.125% Indenture) dated November 30, 2009 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. 60 Table of Contents From December 15, 2013, we may redeem the 8.125% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on December 15, 2013 through December 14, 2014 104.063 % Beginning on December 15, 2014 through December 14, 2015 102.031 % On December 15, 2015 and thereafter 100.000 % As of December 29, 2012, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 8.125% Notes was $500 million and the remaining carrying value was approximately $464 million, net of debt discount of $36 million. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding the 8.125% Notes. 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2020 On August 4, 2010, we issued $500 million of the 7.75% Notes. The 7.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning February 1, 2011 until the maturity date of August 1, 2020. The 7.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.75% Indenture) dated August 4, 2010 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. From August 1, 2015, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on August 1, 2015 through July 31, 2016 103.875 % Beginning on August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017 102.583 % Beginning on August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018 101.292 % On August 1, 2018 and thereafter 100.000 % As of December 29, 2012, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Notes was $500 million. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” below, for additional information regarding the 7.75% Notes. 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022 On August 15, 2012, we issued $500 million of 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022. The 7.50% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. As of December 29, 2012, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes was $500 million. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding the 7.50% Notes. 61 Table of Contents We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the balance of the 6.00% Notes, 8.125% Notes, 7.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. The agreements governing our 6.00% Notes, 8.125% Notes, 7.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above include primarily $9 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2014. Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above exclude amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 29, 2012, primarily consisted of $13 million of deferred gains resulting from the sale and leaseback of certain of our facilities. Also excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above was $2 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in the caption “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2012. This amount represents a potential cash payment that could be payable by us upon settlement with a taxing authority. We have not included this amount in the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of any settlement with the taxing authority, if any. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 29, 2012, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $23 million for one of our facilities in Canada, which is payable in monthly installments through 2017. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities and in some jurisdictions. We lease the land on which these facilities are built, under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2022. We lease certain manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from 1 to 5 years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 29, 2012 were $160 million. Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties, excluding our wafer purchase commitments to GF under the WSA. As of December 29, 2012, total non-cancelable purchase obligations were $299 million. Obligations to GF Obligations to GF represents all our contractual obligations to GF, including approximately $1.15 billion of our wafer purchase commitments for 2013 and $250 million for the first quarter of 2014 and other payables under the WSA as described below. Under the second amendment to the WSA, GF granted us certain rights to contract with another wafer foundry supplier with respect to specified products for a specified period. In consideration for these rights, we agreed to pay GF $425 million and transfer to GF all of the capital stock of GF that we owned, directly or 62 Table of Contents indirectly. Of the $425 million, we paid $250 million as of December 29, 2012. The remaining payment of $175 million was paid on December 31, 2012. As security for a portion of the payment, we issued a $225 million promissory note to GF. As of December 29, 2012, the outstanding balance under this promissory note was $175 million. We paid all the amounts due for the partial waiver of exclusivity. Accordingly, this promissory note is no longer outstanding. Under the third amendment to the WSA, GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration of this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. Of the $320 million fee, we paid $80 million as of December 29, 2012. The remaining payments are $40 million by April 1, 2013 and $200 million by December 31, 2013. As security for the final payment, we issued a $200 million promissory note to GF. As of December 29, 2012, the outstanding balance under this promissory note was $200 million. 63 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 29, 2012, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, ARS, and corporate bonds. With the exception of our ARS, these investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 29, 2012, all of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 29, 2012, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. As a result of the uncertainties in the credit markets, all of our ARS were negatively affected and auctions for these securities failed to settle on their respective settlement dates since February 2008. As of December 29, 2012, the par value of our ARS was $37 million, with an estimated fair value of $28 million. See “Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report for further information. 64 Table of Contents The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 29, 2012: 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 andthereafter Total 2012Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 75 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 75 $ 75 Weighted-average rate 0.30 % — — — — — 0.30 % Variable rate amounts $ 402 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 402 $ 402 Weighted-average rate 0.15 % — — — — — 0.15 % Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts $ 424 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 424 $ 424 Weighted-average rate 0.53 % — — — — — 0.53 % Variable rate amounts $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 37 $ 37 $ 28 Weighted-average rate — — — — — 1.71 % 1.71 % Long-term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 144 $ 24 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 168 $ 168 Weighted-average rate 1.03 % 0.47 % — — — — 0.95 % Variable rate amounts $ 23 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 23 $ 23 Weighted-average rate 0.12 % — — — — — 0.12 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,068 $ 24 $ — $ — $ — $ 37 $ 1,129 $ 1,120 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ — $ — $ 555 $ — $ 464 $ 1,000 $ 2,019 $ 1,837 Weighted-average effective interest rate — — 8.00 % — 10.00 % 7.63 % 8.27 % 9.09 % Total Debt Obligations $ — $ — $ 555 $ — $ 464 $ 1,000 $ 2,019 $ 1,837 Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy, which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying our strategy, from time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. During the first quarter of 2011, we reassessed our hedging needs related to our Euro foreign exchange contracts and liquidated our Euro currency forward contracts. As a result, during 2011, we recorded a gain of $6 million in other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statement of operations. We may economically hedge any material Euro exposure by entering into Euro currency forward contracts we identify in the future. We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries, primarily those denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. 65 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2014,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2013 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction We are a global semiconductor company with facilities around the world. Within the global semiconductor industry, we offer primarily: (i) x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated as an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, embedded processors and dense servers; and (ii) graphics processing units (GPUs), including professional graphics, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SOC) products, development services and technology for game consoles. In this MD&A, we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. Overview During 2013, we focused on executing our three-phase transformation plan designed to restructure, accelerate and transform AMD to better align our business to the changing computing landscape and to position ourselves to take advantage of new opportunities in high-growth adjacent markets. As of the end of 2013, we completed the first two phases of our strategic transformation plan that we outlined in October 2012, achieving key milestones in our corporate and financial transformation. We completed the restructuring of our company, creating a more efficient business with significantly lower operating expenses. From the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013, we decreased operating expenses by approximately 31%. We also launched new products in accordance with our product roadmap and ramped our new semi-custom design capabilities in 2013. In the first half of 2013, Sony announced that it would use a semi-custom APU based on our “Jaguar” CPU core and next-generation Radeon graphics in its PlayStation®4 game console system, and Microsoft announced that the Xbox One would feature an AMD semi-custom SOC product. We began shipping our AMD semi-custom SOCs in the second quarter of 2013 to support the launch of the PlayStation®4 and Xbox One in the fourth quarter of 2013. With respect to our graphics products, we launched our AMD Radeon R7 and R9 series desktop graphics cards designed for enthusiast gamers, and we launched our AMD Radeon R7, R9 and R5 M200 series mobile discrete graphics processors based on our Graphics Core Next architecture for notebook GPUs in October 2013. For the traditional PC market, we introduced several new client processors, including our next generation 2013 AMD Elite Performance A-Series APUs, codenamed “Richland,” for premium ultrathin, traditional and performance notebooks and our AMD Elite Performance A-Series APUs for desktop PCs. We also launched our next generation 2013 AMD Mainstream quad-core x86 SOC, codenamed “Kabini,” designed for entry-level and small-form factor touch notebooks and our 2013 AMD Elite Mobility SOC, codenamed “Temash,” our first 28nm, quad-core x86 SOC designed for small form-factor notebooks, tablets and hybrids 13 inches and below. Net revenue for 2013 was $5.3 billion, a decrease of 2% compared to 2012 net revenue of $5.4 billion. Our operating income for 2013 improved to $103 million, compared to an operating loss of $1.1 billion in 2012. Our 41 Table of Contents net loss for 2013 improved to $83 million compared to a net loss of $1.2 billion for 2012. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term marketable securities, as of December 28, 2013 were $1.2 billion, the same as of December 29, 2012. The financial results for the second half of 2013 were evidence of our transformation efforts, as we derived more than 30% of net revenues from semi-custom and embedded products. During the second half of 2013, we also began laying the foundation for execution of the third phase of our transformation plan, in which we intend to expand our business beyond a transitioning traditional PC industry by creating a more diverse product portfolio and expanding our revenue base into new high-growth adjacent markets. We seek to transform our business to attain approximately 50% of revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Formation and Accounting On March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (ATIC) and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), pursuant to which we formed GF. In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD, ATIC and GF entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement) and a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement) on March 2, 2009. At GF’s formation on March 2, 2009 and through December 26, 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity and we were deemed to be GF’s primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidated GF under applicable accounting rules. As a result of certain GF governance changes, we deconsolidated GF and accounted for our GF ownership under the equity method of accounting as of December 27, 2009. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party. In the first quarter of 2011, as a result of a contribution to GF by an affiliate of ATIC and certain GF governance changes noted above, our ownership in GF was diluted and we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, we changed our accounting for our investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we identified indicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. We performed a valuation analysis and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million. The carrying value of our remaining investment in GF after the impairment charge was $278 million as of December 31, 2011. On March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, we transferred to GF all of the remaining capital stock of GF that we owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated and we were no longer party to the Shareholders’ Agreement. As a result of these transactions, we no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012. GF continues to be a related party of us because Mubadala Development Company PJSC’s (Mubadala) and ATIC are affiliated with WCH, our largest stockholder. WCH and ATIC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala. Wafer Supply Agreement The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures microprocessor and APU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and APU products to GF. 42 Table of Contents The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply. On April 2, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the first amendment was to change the pricing methodology applicable to wafers delivered in 2011 for our microprocessors and APU products. The first amendment also modified our existing commitments regarding the production of certain GPU and chipset products at GF. On March 4, 2012, we entered into a second amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the second amendment was to modify certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us during 2012. Under the terms of the second amendment to the WSA, GF granted us rights to contract with another wafer foundry supplier with respect to specified 28nm products for a specified period of time (the limited waiver of exclusivity). In consideration for the limited waiver of exclusivity, we recorded a charge of $703 million in the first quarter of 2012, consisting of a $425 million cash payment and a $278 million non-cash charge representing the transfer to GF of our remaining investment in GF at fair value. On December 6, 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us from the fourth quarter of 2012 through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded a lower of cost or market charge of $273 million for the write-down of inventory to its market value in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee was paid over several quarters, with $80 million paid on December 28, 2012, $40 million paid on April 1, 2013 and $200 million paid on December 31, 2013. We are currently in the process of negotiating a fourth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. Our expenses related to GF’s wafer manufacturing were $962 million, $1.2 billion and $904 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our expenses related to GF’s research and development activities were $16 million, $49 million and $79 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. 43 Table of Contents Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units, discounted using estimated discount rates. The key assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13% in 2011 to 30% in 2013. Discount rates are based on our weighted-average cost of capital, adjusted for the risks associated with operations. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any. Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2013 and 2012, each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment. For the annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2013, each reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, ranging from approximately 35% to approximately 223%. The Computing Solutions reporting unit had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at 35% due to the decline in the PC market and increased competition. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 29, 2013, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit. Estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. Potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our Computing Solutions reporting unit include adverse 44 Table of Contents changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our Computing Solutions reporting unit declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment charges. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense. Results of Operations Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net, and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. We use the following two reportable segments: • the Computing Solutions segment, comprised of x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated as an APU, chipsets, embedded processors and dense servers; and • the Graphics and Visual Solutions segment, comprised of GPUs, including professional graphics, semi-custom SOC products, revenue from development services and royalties for game consoles. In addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category includes certain expenses and credits that were not allocated to any of the operating segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the operating segments. Also included in this category are amortization of acquired intangible assets, employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other special charges, net, a charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF and a net gain from licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters. We also reported the results of former businesses in the All Other category because the operating results were not material. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. We use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 included 52 weeks, 52 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively. The extra week in 2011 did not have a material impact on our results of operations. References in this report to 2013, 2012 and 2011 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. 45 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for 2013, 2012 and 2011. 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing Solutions $ 3,104 $ 4,005 $ 5,002 Graphics and Visual Solutions 2,193 1,417 1,565 All Other 2 — 1 Total net revenue $ 5,299 $ 5,422 $ 6,568 Operating income (loss): Computing Solutions $ (22 ) $ (231 ) $ 556 Graphics and Visual Solutions 216 105 51 All Other (91 ) (930 ) (239 ) Total operating income (loss) $ 103 $ (1,056 ) $ 368 Interest income 5 8 10 Interest expense (177 ) (175 ) (180 ) Other income (expense), net (5 ) 6 (199 ) Dilution gain in investee, net — — 492 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ (74 ) $ (1,217 ) $ 491 Computing Solutions Computing Solutions net revenue of $3.1 billion in 2013 decreased by 22% compared to $4.0 billion in 2012 as a result of a 20% decrease in unit shipments and a 3% decrease in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was primarily attributable to lower unit shipments of our microprocessors and chipset products. Average selling price of all categories of products decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012. Unit shipments and average selling price for microprocessor products other than microprocessors for servers and for chipsets decreased primarily due to challenging market conditions and the increasing popularity of tablets as a consumer device of choice, which resulted in decreased demand for our products. Unit shipments and average selling price of our microprocessors for servers decreased primarily due to challenging market conditions. Computing Solutions net revenue of $4.0 billion in 2012 decreased by 20% compared to $5.0 billion in 2011 as a result of a 14% decrease in unit shipments and a 7% decrease in average selling price. Unit shipments of all categories of products decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011. The decrease in the average selling price was primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling price of our microprocessors for desktop PCs and servers. Unit shipments and average selling price of our microprocessors for desktop PCs decreased due to challenging market conditions and the increasing popularity of tablets as a consumer device of choice, which resulted in decreased demand for our products. Unit shipments and average selling price of our microprocessors for servers decreased primarily due to challenging market conditions. Computing Solutions operating loss was $22 million in 2013 compared to an operating loss of $231 million in 2012. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to a $753 million decrease in cost of sales, a $179 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses and a $178 million decrease in research and development expenses, partially offset by the decrease in net revenue referenced above. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments in 2013 compared to 2012 as well as the absence of the $273 million lower of cost or market charge related to the fee for GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations and an inventory write-down of approximately $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products, codenamed “Llano”. In addition, operating loss for 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that had been previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. 46 Table of Contents Computing Solutions operating loss was $231 million in 2012 compared to operating income of $556 million in 2011. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $136 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses, a $45 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $29 million decrease in cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments, partially offset by the $273 million lower of cost or market charge related to the fee for GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations and an inventory write-down of $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Graphics and Visual Solutions Graphics and Visual Solutions net revenue of $2.2 billion in 2013 increased by 55% compared to net revenue of $1.4 billion in 2012. The increase was primarily due to net revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SOC products, which we began shipping in the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by a 16% decrease in net revenue from sales of our GPU products. Net revenue from sales of GPU products decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower unit shipments, partially offset by higher average selling price. GPU unit shipments decreased due to challenging consumer PC market conditions, which adversely impacted demand. GPU average selling price increased primarily due to improved product mix. Graphics and Visual Solutions net revenue of $1.4 billion in 2012 decreased by 9% compared to net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue from sales of GPU products, partially offset by an increase in net revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology. Net revenue from sales of GPU products decreased due to lower unit shipments, partially offset by increased average selling price. GPU unit shipments decreased due to challenging market conditions. GPU average selling price increased primarily due to improved product mix. Graphics and Visual Solutions operating income was $216 million in 2013 compared to $105 million in 2012. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $600 million increase in cost of sales, a $36 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses and a $29 million increase in research and development expenses. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the commencement of unit shipments of our semi-custom SOC products in the second quarter of 2013. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. Graphics and Visual Solutions operating income was $105 million in 2012 compared to $51 million in 2011. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to a $101 million decrease in cost of sales, a $60 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $41 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the decrease in net revenue referenced above. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower GPU shipments and correspondingly lower manufacturing costs. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. All Other All Other revenue pertains to results from former businesses, which were immaterial in 2013, 2012 and 2011. All Other operating loss of $91 million in 2013 included stock-based compensation expense of $91 million, net restructuring and other special charges of $30 million and $18 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into licenses and settlements regarding patent-related matters, for which we received in aggregate $48 million in net cash, which we recorded as a gain in operating expense. 47 Table of Contents All Other operating loss of $930 million in 2012 included a $703 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, $100 million of net restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense of $97 million, $14 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and $6 million related to our acquisition of SeaMicro, Inc. (SeaMicro) in 2012. All Other operating loss of $239 million in 2011 included $98 million of net restructuring charges, $90 million of stock-based compensation expense, $29 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF primarily related to certain GF manufacturing assets that did not benefit us. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net, Income Taxes and Dilution Gain in Investee, Net The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2013, 2012 and 2011. 2013 2012 2011 (In millions, except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 3,321 $ 4,187 $ 3,628 Gross margin 1,978 1,235 2,940 Gross margin percentage 37 % 23 % 45 % Research and development 1,201 1,354 1,453 Marketing, general and administrative 674 823 992 Legal settlements, net (48 ) — — Amortization of acquired intangible assets 18 14 29 Restructuring and other special charges, net 30 100 98 Interest income 5 8 10 Interest expense (177 ) (175 ) (180 ) Other income (expense), net (5 ) 6 (199 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 9 (34 ) (4 ) Dilution gain in investee, net $ — $ — $ 492 Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 37% in 2013 compared to 23% in 2012. Gross margin in 2012 included a $703 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, a lower of cost or market charge of $273 million and a $5 million charge recorded to cost of sales related to a legal settlement. Absent the effect of these charges, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 41% in 2012 compared to 37% in 2013. Gross margin in 2013 was adversely impacted by the lower average gross margins in our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment primarily driven by lower margin semi-custom SOC products, which we began shipping in the second quarter of 2013. Gross margin in 2012 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products, codenamed “Llano,” which accounted for two gross margin percentage points. Gross margin in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of this previously reserved inventory, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 23% in 2012 compared to 45% in 2011. Gross margin in 2012 included a $703 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, a lower of cost or market charge of $273 million and a $5 million charge recorded to cost of sales related to a legal settlement. Gross margin in 2011 included a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF primarily related to certain GF manufacturing assets and a charge of approximately $5 million recorded to cost of sales related to a legal settlement. Absent the effects of the charges as described above, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 41% in 2012 compared to 48 Table of Contents 45% in 2011. Gross margin in 2012 was also adversely impacted by the $100 million inventory write-down in the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products as well as lower average selling price for microprocessor products. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $1.2 billion in 2013 decreased by $153 million, or 11%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $178 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense recorded in the All Other category, partially offset by a $29 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment decreased as a result of a $157 million decrease in product engineering costs and a $41 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses, partially offset by a $20 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment was primarily due to a $17 million increase in product engineering costs and a $14 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2012, decreased by $99 million, or 7%, compared to $1.5 billion in 2011. The decrease was due to a $60 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment and a $45 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment, partially offset by a $6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense recorded in the All Other category. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment decreased as a result of a $36 million decrease in product engineering costs, a $16 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $9 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $26 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense, an $11 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products and a $9 million decrease in product engineering costs. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $674 million in 2013 decreased by $149 million, or 18%, compared to $823 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $179 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $6 million decrease in the All Other category due to the absence of SeaMicro acquisition-related costs recorded in 2012, partially offset by a $36 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment decreased primarily due to a $101 million decrease in sales and marketing activities and an $82 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $5 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expense. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment increased primarily due to a $46 million increase in other general and administrative expenses and a $4 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expense, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in sales and marketing activities. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $823 million in 2012 decreased by $169 million, or 17%, compared to $992 million in 2011, reflecting the effect of the 2011 restructuring plan and our efforts to reduce operating expenses. The decrease was primarily due to a $136 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $41 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment, 49 Table of Contents partially offset by a $6 million increase in corporate general and administrative expenses attributable to our SeaMicro acquisition, which we recorded in the All Other category. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment decreased primarily due to a $111 million decrease in sales and marketing activities and a $22 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment was a result of a $24 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses and a $16 million decrease in sales and marketing activities. Legal Settlements During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters for which we received in aggregate $48 million in net cash, which we recorded as a gain in operating expenses. At the time we entered into the agreements, we did not have any future obligations that we were required to perform in order to earn the settlement payments. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $18 million in 2013, $14 million in 2012 and $29 million in 2011. The increase from 2012 to 2013 was due to amortization of the intangible assets of SeaMicro, which we acquired in 2012. The decrease from 2011 to 2012 was due to the reduced amortization base amount of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by our SeaMicro acquisition. Restructuring and Other Special Charges, Net Sale and Leaseback Transactions In September 2013, we sold a light industrial building in Singapore and leased back a portion of the original space. We received net cash proceeds of $46 million in connection with the sale, which resulted in a $17 million gain that we recorded in the third quarter of 2013 and a deferred gain of $14 million (as of September 28, 2013) that we will amortize over the initial operating lease term. The initial operating lease term expires in September 2023 and provides for options to extend the operating lease for 4 years at the end of the initial lease term and for an additional 3.5 years thereafter. In September 2013, we also sold an office building in Austin, Texas. We received net cash proceeds of $10 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $5 million gain in the third quarter of 2013. In March 2013, we sold and leased back certain land and office buildings in Austin, Texas. We received net cash proceeds of $164 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $52 million charge in the first quarter of 2013. The operating lease expires in March 2025 and provides for one 10-year optional renewal. In March 2013, we also sold an office building in Markham, Ontario, Canada and leased back a portion of the original space through June 2013. We received net cash proceeds of $13 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $6 million gain in the first quarter of 2013. The net charge of $24 million recognized in 2013 related to the real estate transactions described above is recorded in the “Restructuring and other special charges, net” line item on the consolidated statements of operations. Effects of Restructuring Plans 2012 Restructuring Plan In the fourth quarter of 2012, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve our cost structure and to strengthen our competitiveness in core growth areas. The plan primarily involved a workforce reduction of 50 Table of Contents approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We recorded restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million, which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the restructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2013, we incurred costs of $11 million related to facility consolidation and site closures, which were partially offset by the release of estimated employee-related severance costs of $5 million. The 2012 restructuring plan was completed as of the end of the third quarter of 2013. 2011 Restructuring Plan In the fourth quarter of 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan to strengthen our competitive positioning, implement a more competitive cost structure and conduct a workforce rebalancing to better address faster growing market segments. The plan included a reduction of workforce of approximately 13% and contract and program terminations. We recorded a $100 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2011, which consisted of $54 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $45 million for contract or program termination costs and $1 million for asset impairments. In 2012, we recorded an additional $8 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits. The 2011 restructuring plan was completed as of the end of the first quarter of 2012. The following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2013 and 2012 and the remaining related liabilities recorded in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 28, 2013: Severance and related benefits Other exit Related Costs Total (In millions) Balance at December 31, 2011 $ 22 $ 45 $ 67 Charges 95 5 100 Cash payments (76 ) (29 ) (105 ) Non-cash charges (reversals), net — (4 ) (4 ) Balance at December 29, 2012 41 17 58 Charges (reversals), net (5 ) 11 6 Cash payments (33 ) (21 ) (54 ) Balance at December 28, 2013 $ 3 $ 7 $ 10 2008 Restructuring Plan In 2011, we reversed approximately $2 million related to costs associated with the 2008 restructuring plan because the actual restoration costs for vacated facilities were lower than previously estimated. The following table provides a summary of each major type of cost associated with the 2012, 2011 and 2008 restructuring plans for the periods presented: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Severance and benefits charges (reversals), net $ (5 ) $ 95 $ 54 Contract or program termination charges — — 45 Asset impairments — 4 1 Facility consolidation and closure charges (reversals), net 11 1 (2 ) Total $ 6 $ 100 $ 98 51 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income was $5 million in 2013 compared to $8 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average investments in marketable securities during 2013. Interest income was $8 million in 2012 compared to $10 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate during 2012. Interest Expense Interest expense of $177 million in 2013 was relatively flat as compared to $175 million in 2012 and $180 million in 2011. Other Income (Expense), Net Other expense, net, in 2013 was $5 million compared to $6 million of other income, net, in 2012 and $199 million of other expense, net, in 2011. In 2013, we recognized $5 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $2 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a $2 million realized loss on sale of our auction rate securities (ARS) investments. In 2012, we recognized $6 million of other income, net, primarily due to other income recorded in the third quarter of 2012, partially offset by a $5 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a $4 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to one of our ARS investments. In 2011, we recognized an impairment charge on our investment in GF of approximately $209 million and a $6 million loss related to our repurchase of $200 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes), which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes, partially offset by an $8 million gain on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $9 million in 2013 and an income tax benefit of $34 million and $4 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The income tax provision in 2013 was primarily due to $9 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $3 million related to the reversal of previously recognized tax benefits associated with other comprehensive income, offset by $3 million of tax benefits for Canadian co-op credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits. The income tax benefit in 2012 was primarily due to a tax benefit of $36 million relating to our SeaMicro acquisition, a $1 million tax benefit for the tax effects of items credited directly to other comprehensive income, a $2 million tax benefit for Canadian co-op tax credits and a $9 million tax benefit associated with the successful negotiation of a tax holiday in a foreign jurisdiction net of $14 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations. The income tax benefit in 2011 was primarily due to tax benefits of $4 million from the monetization of U.S. and Canadian tax credits, a $4 million reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions, primarily due to a favorable audit resolution in a foreign jurisdiction, net of $4 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations. 52 Table of Contents As of December 28, 2013, substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 28, 2013, in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. On January 2, 2013 the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act) was passed into law. The Act included a retroactive extension of the U.S. research credit for 2012. Since the effects of tax law changes are recognized in the first period which includes the date of enactment, the Act had no impact on our 2012 tax provision. The impact on our 2013 tax provision was immaterial due to the effects of the valuation allowance. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was allocated in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 5 $ 8 $ 6 Research and development 48 52 46 Marketing, general and administrative 38 37 38 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0 $ 91 $ 97 $ 90 During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows. Stock-based compensation expense of $91 million in 2013 decreased by $6 million as compared to $97 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a lower weighted average grant date fair value and lower stock compensation expense as a result of our 2012 restructuring plan, partially offset by the additional expense related to stock options and restricted stock granted in connection with our SeaMicro acquisition. Stock-based compensation expenses of $97 million in 2012 increased $7 million compared to $90 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the additional expense related to the equity grants made in connection with our SeaMicro acquisition and an increase in the number of employee stock options and restricted stock units that we granted, partially offset by the absence of a charge related to the acceleration of vesting of all unvested equity incentive awards held by our former Chief Executive Officer in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of his resignation from AMD, effective January 10, 2011, and a lower weighted-average estimated grant date fair value in 2012 as compared to 2011. As of December 28, 2013, we had $26 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.90 years. Also, as of December 28, 2013, we had $112 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.03 years. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 85% in 2013, 92% in 2012 and 93% in 2011. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2013 compared 2012 and 2011 was primarily driven by an increase in net revenue from domestic sales of our semi-custom SOC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars. 53 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term marketable securities, were $1.2 billion as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012. During 2013, our $175 million payment related to GF’s limited waiver of exclusivity and $40 million payment related to GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations for wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 were partially offset by proceeds of $154 million related to building sales, net of purchases of property and equipment. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters for which we received in aggregate $48 million in net cash. The percentage of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically was 91% as of December 28, 2013. Our long-term marketable securities currently consist of corporate bonds and money market funds. The corporate bonds have maximum stated maturities of two years. As of December 28, 2013, the fair value of these long-term marketable securities was $90 million. All of the long-term marketable securities were held in the United States. Our intent is to hold our long-term marketable securities for greater than one year, and we do not intend to use them in current operations. During 2013, net proceeds from the maturity of our long-term marketable securities were $91 million. As a result of narrowing investment yields, we intend to continue to evaluate our investment strategy related to amounts we designate as long-term as such investments mature. As of December 28, 2013, our total debt was $2.1 billion, which reflects a debt discount adjustment of $43 million on our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (8.125% Notes). In the fourth quarter of 2013, we established a senior secured asset based line of credit for a principal amount up to $500 million (Secured Revolving Line of Credit). As of December 28, 2013, our outstanding balance under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit was $55 million. We repurchased $50 million of outstanding principal amount of our 6.00% Notes (which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes). Subsequent to December 28, 2013, we repurchased an additional $64 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. For 2013, our net cash used in operating activities was $148 million and our non-GAAP free cash flow was negative $232 million. For 2012, our net cash used in operating activities was $338 million and our non-GAAP free cash flow was negative $471 million. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure which we calculate by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures, which were $84 million for 2013 and $133 million for 2012. The improvement in our non-GAAP free cash flow for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to a $190 million decrease in net cash used in operating activities as well as a $49 million decrease in capital expenditures. We calculate and communicate non-GAAP free cash flow because our management believes it is important for investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. Our calculation of non-GAAP free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view non-GAAP free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating or financing activities. In light of the macroeconomic environment, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we announced a restructuring plan to reduce our operating expenses and better position us competitively. As a result of our restructuring, we decreased operating expenses by approximately 31% from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013. With the impact of our restructuring plan, the liquidity provided by our Secured Revolving Line of Credit and the availability of external financing, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term marketable securities, balance will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next twelve months. 54 Table of Contents We believe that in the event we decide to obtain additional external funding, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Over the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We cannot assure you that macroeconomic conditions will improve, and they could worsen. If market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities. Auction Rate Securities During 2013, we realized a loss of $2 million on sales of approximately $28 million of ARS. We no longer hold any ARS investments as of December 28, 2013. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $148 million in 2013. A net loss of $83 million in 2013 was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $236 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $91 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $31 million net loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and $25 million of non-cash interest expenses related to our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes. The net changes in operating assets as of December 28, 2013 compared to December 29, 2012 included an increase in inventories of $322 million, largely driven by an increase in Computing Solutions inventory as well as semi-custom SOC products due to our customers’ next generation game console ramps, an increase in accounts receivable of $200 million, which was primarily due to higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase in other assets of $92 million, primarily due to new software licenses and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $11 million. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased by $266 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to a $241 million increase in accounts payable driven by larger purchases of inventory to support higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, a $36 million increase in deferred income on shipments to our distributor customers, and a $28 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits, partially offset by a $39 million decrease in other liabilities, primarily due to a decrease in restructuring accruals and payments for technology licenses. During 2013, our payables to GF, which included all amounts we owe to GF, decreased by $89 million as compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily due to payments of $175 million related to GF’s limited waiver of exclusivity and $40 million related to GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations for wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by an increase of $126 million of payables related to wafer purchases. Net cash used in operating activities was $338 million in 2012. A net loss of $1.2 billion in 2012 was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of a $278 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, $260 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $97 million of stock-based compensation expense and $23 million of non-cash interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes. These charges were partially offset by a benefit of $40 million for deferred income taxes. The net changes in operating assets as of December 29, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 included a decrease in accounts receivable of $290 million and an increase in inventories of $83 million, which were primarily due to lower sales during 2012. During 2012, our payable to GF, which included all amounts that we owe to GF, increased by $277 million as compared to 2011. The increase was due to cash obligations of $240 million related to the third amendment to the WSA and $175 million related to the limited waiver of exclusivity, partially offset by a 55 Table of Contents decrease of $138 million in the amount of billings related to wafer purchases. Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other decreased by $232 million in 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily due to a $94 million decrease in accrued liabilities, a $92 million decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities, a $23 million decrease in other liabilities, a $15 million decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors and a $6 million decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. Net cash provided by operating activities was $382 million in 2011. Net income of $491 million in 2011 was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $317 million of depreciation and amortization expense, a $209 million impairment charge on our investment in GF, $90 million of stock based compensation expense, and $21 million of non-cash interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and our 8.125% Notes. These charges were partially offset by recognition of a non-cash gain of $492 million in 2011 due to the dilution of our equity interest in GF. The net changes in operating assets at December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010 included an increase in accounts receivable of $347 million, which included the non-cash impact of our previous financing arrangements with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and its affiliates. During 2011, IBM and its affiliates collected approximately $396 million from our distributor customers pursuant to these arrangements. Without considering the collection by these parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, our accounts receivable decreased $49 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. This decrease was primarily due to timing of sales and collections during 2011. There was also a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $115 million primarily due to the receipt of the final settlement payment from Samsung of $117 million. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $455 million in 2013 and primarily consisted of net proceeds of $301 million from the purchase, sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities and net proceeds of $154 million from sales and purchases of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $19 million in 2012. We had a net cash inflow of $404 million in 2012 from purchases, sales and maturity of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a net cash outflow of $281 million related to our SeaMicro acquisition, a cash outflow of $133 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and a cash outflow of $9 million related to other investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $113 million in 2011. We had a net cash outflow of $234 million in 2011 from the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment. The net cash outflows were partially offset by a net cash inflow of $140 million from purchase, sale, and maturity of available-for-sale securities. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $13 million in 2013, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $55 million, net proceeds from U.S. government grants for research and development activities and foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products of $11 million and $3 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan, partially offset by the repurchase of $50 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes (which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes) in open market transactions and $5 million in payments for capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $37 million in 2012, primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes) of $491 million, $23 million from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $14 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan, partially offset by our repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest on our 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 and repayment of capital lease obligations of $489 million. 56 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities was $6 million in 2011 as a result of payments of $202 million to repurchase $200 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes (which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes). This amount was partially offset by $170 million of proceeds from our former financing arrangement with IBM and affiliates, $20 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities, and $18 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows for these periods. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 28, 2013, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period (In millions) Total 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 and thereafter 6.00% Notes(1) $ 530 $ — $ 530 $ — $ — $ — $ — 8.125% Notes(1) 500 — — — 500 — — 7.75% Notes 500 — — — — — 500 7.50% Notes 500 — — — — — 500 Secured Revolving Line of Credit 55 55 — — — — — Other long-term liabilities 136 — 67 39 29 — 1 Aggregate interest obligation(2) 858 149 127 117 115 76 274 Capital lease obligations(3) 19 6 6 6 1 — — Operating leases 388 59 51 43 40 39 156 Purchase obligations(4) 456 438 16 1 1 — — Obligations to GF(5) 450 450 — — — — — Total contractual obligations $ 4,392 $ 1,157 $ 797 $ 206 $ 686 $ 115 $ 1,431 (1) Represents aggregate par value of the notes, without the effect of associated discounts.

In addition we have obligations for software technology and licenses where payments are fixed and non-cancelable. (5) This amount includes all our contractual obligations to GF through the first quarter of 2014, including a $200 million payment made on December 31, 2013 relating to the $320 million fee due as consideration for a waiver from GF of our purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 On April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. Our 6.00% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015. The terms of our 6.00% Notes are governed by an indenture dated April 27, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. 57 Table of Contents In 2013, we repurchased $50 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes in open market transactions for $53 million. As of December 28, 2013, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes was $530 million and the remaining carrying value was approximately $517 million, net of debt discount of $13 million. Subsequent to December 28, 2013, we repurchased an additional $64 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. See Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding our 6.00% Notes. 8.125% Senior Notes Due 2017 On November 30, 2009, we issued $500 million of our 8.125% Notes at a discount of 10.204%. Our 8.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning June 15, 2010 until the maturity date of December 15, 2017. The discount of $51 million is recorded as contra debt and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the 8.125% Notes using the effective interest method. Our 8.125% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture dated November 30, 2009 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. Starting December 15, 2013, we may redeem the 8.125% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price as Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on December 15, 2013 through December 14, 2014 104.063 % Beginning on December 15, 2014 through December 14, 2015 102.031 % On December 15, 2015 and thereafter 100.000 % As of December 28, 2013, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 8.125% Notes was $500 million and the remaining carrying value was approximately $470 million, net of debt discount of $30 million. See Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding our 8.125% Notes. 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2020 On August 4, 2010, we issued $500 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2020 (7.75% Notes). Our 7.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning February 1, 2011 until the maturity date of August 1, 2020. Our 7.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture dated August 4, 2010 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. Starting August 1, 2015, we may redeem our 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price as Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on August 1, 2015 through July 31, 2016 103.875 % Beginning on August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017 102.583 % Beginning on August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018 101.292 % On August 1, 2018 and thereafter 100.000 % As of December 28, 2013, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Notes was $500 million.

Our 7.50% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. Our 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture dated August 15, 2012 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. As of December 28, 2013, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes was $500 million. See Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding our 7.50% Notes. Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 6.00% Notes, 8.125% Notes, 7.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Subsequent to December 28, 2013, we repurchased an additional $64 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes (which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes). Secured Revolving Line of Credit On November 12, 2013, we and our subsidiary, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (together, the Borrowers), entered into a loan and security agreement (the Loan Agreement) for our Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount up to $500 million, with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, with a group of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., acting as agent for the lenders (the Agent). Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit matures on November 12, 2018. Borrowings under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit are limited to up to 85% of eligible account receivable minus certain reserves and may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs. The Borrowers can elect that the borrowings under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit may bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (a) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.75%, or (b) (i) the greater of (x) the Agent’s prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50%, and (z) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.00%, plus (ii) an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%. The applicable margin to be applied to the borrowings under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit is dependent on the Borrowers achieving a certain fixed charge coverage ratio. Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be optionally prepaid or terminated or unutilized commitments may be reduced, in each case at any time without premium or penalty. In connection with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, the Borrowers are required to pay an unused line fee equal to 0.50% per annum, payable monthly on the unused amount of the commitments under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The unused line fee decreases to 0.375% per annum when more than 50% of our Secured Revolving Line of Credit is utilized. The Borrowers will pay (i) a monthly fee on all letters of credit outstanding under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit equal to the applicable LIBOR margin and (ii) a fronting fee to the Agent equal to 0.125% of all such letters of credit, payable monthly in arrears. The obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority basis in the Borrowers’ account receivable, inventory and certain deposit accounts and specified related assets. The Loan Agreement contains covenants that place certain restrictions on the Borrowers’ ability to, among other things, amend or modify certain terms of any debt of $50 million or more or subordinated debt, create or suffer to exist any liens upon accounts or inventory, sell or transfer any of Borrowers’ accounts or inventory 59 Table of Contents other than certain ordinary-course transfers, make certain changes to either Borrower’s name or form or state of organization without notifying the Agent, or liquidate, dissolve, merge, combine or consolidate. Further restrictions apply during a domestic cash trigger period (a Domestic Cash Trigger Period), which occurs (i) upon an event of default or (ii) when the amount of domestic cash or cash equivalents held in certain accounts is at any time less than $500 million, and ends when both (a) no event of default has existed for 45 days and (b) the amount of domestic cash or cash equivalents held in such accounts has been equal to or greater than $500 million for 45 days. Such restrictions limit the Borrowers’ ability to, among other things, allow certain subsidiaries that manufacture or process inventory for the Borrowers to borrow secured debt or unsecured debt beyond a certain amount, create any liens upon any of the Borrowers’ property (other than customary permitted liens and liens on up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt (which amount includes our Secured Revolving Line of Credit)), declare or make any distributions, create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments, make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions, make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date, become a party to certain agreements restricting the Borrowers’ ability to incur or repay debt, grant liens, make distributions, or modify loan agreements or enter into any non-arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate. During a Domestic Cash Trigger Period, the Borrowers are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio each four-fiscal quarter period ending on and after March 29, 2014. At December 28, 2013, the outstanding loan balance under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit was $55 million, with an interest rate of 2.75%, and up to $445 million remained available for future borrowings. As of December 28, 2013, we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Loan Agreement. The agreements governing our 6.00% Notes, 8.125% Notes, 7.75% Notes and 7.50% and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit Notes contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above primarily consists of $131 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2017 and $4 million of payments related to employee compensation and benefit obligations that will be paid through 2019 and beyond. Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above exclude amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 28, 2013, primarily consisted of $23 million of deferred gains resulting from certain real estate transactions that occurred in Sunnyvale, California in 1998, in Markham, Ontario, Canada, in 2008 and in Singapore in 2013. Also excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above is $8 million deferred rent related to our facilities in Sunnyvale, California, $5 million restructuring accruals related to our 2012 restructuring plan, and $3 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in the caption “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 28, 2013. This amount represents a potential cash payment that could be payable by us upon settlement with a taxing authority. We have not included this amount in the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of a settlement with the taxing authority, if any. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 28, 2013, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $16 million for one of our facilities in Canada, which is payable in monthly installments through 2017. 60 Table of Contents Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, and in some jurisdictions, we lease the land on which these facilities are built under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2025. We lease certain manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from 1 to 5 years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 28, 2013 were $388 million, including approximately $322 million of future lease payments and estimated operating costs related to real estate in Austin, Texas, Sunnyvale, California and Singapore that we sold and leased back. Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties, excluding our wafer purchase commitments to GF under the WSA. As of December 28, 2013, total non-cancelable purchase obligations were $456 million. Obligations to GF Obligations to GF represent all of our contractual obligations to GF, including approximately $250 million for inventory purchases during the first quarter of 2014 and other payables under the WSA as described below. Pursuant to the third amendment to the WSA, GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. The cash impact of this $320 million fee was paid over several quarters, with $80 million paid on December 28, 2012, $40 million paid on April 1, 2013 and $200 million paid on December 31, 2013. We are currently in the process of negotiating a fourth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 28, 2013, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 28, 2013, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of time deposits, commercial paper and corporate bonds. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 28, 2013, all of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 28, 2013, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. During 2013, we realized a loss of $2 million on sales of approximately $28 million of ARS. We no longer hold any ARS investments as of December 28, 2013. The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 28, 2013: 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 andthereafter Total 2013Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 421 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 421 $ 421 Weighted-average rate 0.14 % — — — — — 0.14 % Variable rate amounts $ 19 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 19 $ 19 Weighted-average rate 5.46 % — — — — — 5.46 % Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts $ 228 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 228 $ 228 Weighted-average rate 0.34 % — — — — — 0.34 % Long-term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 60 $ 28 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 88 $ 88 Weighted-average rate 0.44 % 0.61 % — — — — 0.49 % Variable rate amounts $ 20 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 20 $ 20 Weighted-average rate 0.03 % — — — — — 0.03 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 748 $ 28 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 776 $ 776 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ 55 $ 517 $ — $ 470 $ — $ 1,000 $ 2,042 $ 2,132 Weighted-averageeffective interest rate 2.75 % 8.00 % — % 10.00 % — % 7.63 % 8.08 % 7.74 % Total Debt Obligations $ 55 $ 517 $ — $ 470 $ — $ 1,000 $ 2,042 $ 2,132 62 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy, which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying our strategy, from time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries, primarily those denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2015,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 27, 2014 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction We are a global semiconductor company with facilities worldwide. Within the global semiconductor industry, we offer primarily: (i) x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated as an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) and professional graphics; and (ii) server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles. In this MD&A, we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2014 compared to 2013 and 2013 compared to 2012, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. Overview Net revenue for 2014 was $5.5 billion, an increase of 4% compared to 2013 net revenue of $5.3 billion. The increase in net revenue from 2013 was due to a 51% increase in Embedded, Enterprise and Semi-Custom segment revenue, primarily due to higher semi-custom SoC sales. The annual increase in Embedded, Enterprise and Semi-Custom segment net revenue was offset by a 16% decrease in Computing and Graphics segment net revenue. The annual decrease in the Computing and Graphics segment was primarily due to lower desktop processor and chipset sales. While we believe the pace of the decline in the PC market is slowing, our annual Computing and Graphics segment results reflect the ongoing challenges of a competitive consumer PC market. During 2014, as part of our strategy to transform our business to attain approximately 50% of our revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio. By the end of 2014, we derived approximately 40% of our annual revenues from high-growth markets. In the second quarter of 2014, we announced our ambidextrous computing roadmap to develop custom high-performance ARM and x86 processor cores for 2016. At the same time, we publicly demonstrated the AMD Opteron™ A1100 Series, our first 64-bit ARM-based server processor based on 28 nanometer (nm) technology. During 2014, we continued to experience strong demand for our AMD semi-custom SoCs that are found in Sony PlayStation®4 and Microsoft Xbox One. We also launched a number of new embedded products during 2014, including the second-generation AMD Embedded R-series APU and CPU, the new x86 AMD Embedded G-Series SoC, the AMD Embedded G-Series CPU and the AMD Embedded Radeon™ E8860 GPU. We also continued to develop and introduce differentiated products in 2014. We expanded our notebook APU offerings in 2014 with the introduction of the AMD 2014 Performance Mobile APU designed for ultrathin and high-performance mobile PCs, the AMD Pro A-Series APU for commercial PCs and the third-generation AMD mainstream and low-powered mobile APU designed for commercial and consumer mobile devices. We also launched a number of graphics products in 2014, including the AMD Radeon™ R9 295X2 and AMD Radeon™ R9 285 designed for performance gaming. In 2014, we made progress in improving our balance sheet by re-profiling our debt maturity schedule. During 2014, we repurchased $487 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes), reducing the outstanding aggregate principal amount to $42 million. We repurchased 41 Table of Contents $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (8.125% Notes). We also repurchased $50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes) in open market transactions, and $25 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes). The repurchases of the 7.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes were funded with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. To assist us in financing these note repurchases, during 2014, we issued $500 million of 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes) and $600 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes). Total debt as of the end December 27, 2014 was $2.2 billion compared to $2.1 billion as of December 28, 2013. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 27, 2014 were $1.0 billion compared to $1.2 billion as of December 28, 2013. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Formation and Accounting On March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (currently known as Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech)) and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), pursuant to which we formed GF. In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD, Mubadala Tech and GF entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement) and a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement) on March 2, 2009. At GF’s formation on March 2, 2009 and through December 26, 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and we were deemed to be GF’s primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidated GF under applicable accounting rules. As a result of certain GF governance changes, we deconsolidated GF and accounted for our GF ownership under the equity method of accounting as of December 27, 2009. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party. In the first quarter of 2011, as a result of a contribution to GF by an affiliate of Mubadala Tech and certain GF governance changes noted above, our ownership in GF was diluted, and we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, we changed our accounting for our investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we identified indicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. We performed a valuation analysis and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million. The carrying value of our remaining investment in GF after the impairment charge was $278 million as of December 31, 2011. On March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, we transferred to GF all of the remaining capital stock of GF that we owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and we were no longer party to the Shareholders’ Agreement. As a result of these transactions, we no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012. GF continues to be a related party of us because Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, our largest stockholder. WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala. Wafer Supply Agreement The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures microprocessor and APU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and APU products to GF. 42 Table of Contents The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply. On April 2, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the first amendment was to change the pricing methodology applicable to wafers delivered in 2011 for our microprocessors and APU products. The first amendment also modified our existing commitments regarding the production of certain GPU and chipset products at GF. On March 4, 2012, we entered into a second amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the second amendment was to modify certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us during 2012. Under the terms of the second amendment to the WSA, GF granted us rights to contract with another wafer foundry supplier with respect to specified 28nm products for a specified period of time (the limited waiver of exclusivity). In consideration for the limited waiver of exclusivity, we recorded a charge of $703 million in the first quarter of 2012 consisting of a $425 million cash payment and a $278 million non-cash charge representing the transfer to GF of our remaining investment in GF at fair value. On December 6, 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us from the fourth quarter of 2012 through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded a lower of cost or market charge of $273 million for the write-down of inventory to its market value in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee was paid over several quarters, with $80 million paid on December 28, 2012, $40 million paid on April 1, 2013 and $200 million paid on December 31, 2013. On March 30, 2014, we entered into a fourth amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the fourth amendment was to establish volume purchase commitments and fixed pricing for the 2014 calendar year as well as to modify certain other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for some of our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom game console products to be delivered by GF to us during the 2014 calendar year. We are currently in the process of negotiating a fifth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. Our total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. 43 Table of Contents Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market condition. The key assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13% to 19% from 2012 to 2014. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly-traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit. 44 Table of Contents For the annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014, we determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of $233 million was recorded, which represented the entire goodwill balance within this reporting unit. The remaining two reporting units’ estimated fair values exceeded their carrying value, ranging from approximately 156% to approximately 209%. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 28, 2014, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit. Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2013 and 2012, each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment. Estimates of fair value for all or our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. Potential events or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Results of Operations Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net, and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. In connection with our continued strategic transformation, effective July 1, 2014, we realigned our organizational structure. As a result of this organizational change, we have the following two reportable segments: • the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics; and • the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties. Effective October 8, 2014, Dr. Lisa T. Su became our Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Rory P. Read. This management change did not result in a change in our reportable segments or to the fact that the Chief Operating Decision Maker is our Chief Executive Officer. 45 Table of Contents In addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. Also included in this category are amortization of acquired intangible assets, employee stock-based compensation expense, net restructuring and other special charges, workforce rebalancing severance charges, goodwill impairment charge, significant or unusual lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, loss on debt repurchases, a charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF and a net gain from licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters. We also reported the results of former businesses in the All Other category because the operating results were not material. In addition, during 2014, we reclassified $273 million of lower of cost or market inventory adjustment previously recorded in Computing and Graphics segment in 2012 to All Other category to conform with the current year’s presentation. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. We use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 each included 52 weeks. References in this report to 2014, 2013 and 2012 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) before income taxes for 2014, 2013 and 2012. The prior period results have been recast to reflect our new reportable segments. 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics $ 3,132 $ 3,720 $ 4,724 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 2,374 1,577 698 All Other — 2 — Total net revenue $ 5,506 $ 5,299 $ 5,422 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics $ (76 ) $ (101 ) $ 129 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 399 295 18 All Other (478 ) (91 ) (1,203 ) Total operating income (loss) $ (155 ) $ 103 $ (1,056 ) Interest income 3 5 8 Interest expense (177 ) (177 ) (175 ) Other income (expense), net (69 ) (5 ) 6 Loss before income taxes $ (398 ) $ (74 ) $ (1,217 ) Computing and Graphics Computing and Graphics net revenue of $3.1 billion in 2014 decreased by 16% compared to $3.7 billion in 2013 as a result of a 27% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by a 15% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was primarily attributable to lower unit shipments of our microprocessor products for desktop and notebook PCs and chipsets due to challenging consumer PC market conditions and our chipsets being integrated into our APU products. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our microprocessor products due to improved product mix of our microprocessor products for desktop and notebook PCs. 46 Table of Contents Computing and Graphics net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2013 decreased by 21% compared to $4.7 billion in 2012 as a result of a 23% decrease in unit shipments and a 2% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was primarily attributable to lower unit shipments of our microprocessor products for desktop and notebook PCs, chipset products and GPU products. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our GPU products, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of our microprocessor products for desktop and notebook PCs and chipset products. Unit shipments and average selling price for microprocessor products for desktop and notebook PCs and chipset products decreased primarily due to challenging market conditions and the increasing popularity of tablets as a consumer device of choice, which resulted in decreased demand for our products. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $76 million in 2014 compared to an operating loss of $101 million in 2013. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to a $323 million decrease in cost of sales, a $201 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $89 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the decrease in net revenue referenced above. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments in 2014 compared to 2013. Operating loss in 2014 included a $19 million benefit from technology licensing revenue. In addition, operating loss in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that had been previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to a similar $8 million benefit in 2014. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $101 million in 2013 compared to an operating income of $129 million in 2012. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $582 million decrease in cost of sales, a $154 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses and a $37 million decrease in research and development expenses. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments in 2013 compared to 2012 as well as the absence of the inventory write-down of approximately $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products, codenamed “Llano”. In addition, operating loss for 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that had been previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2014 increased by 51% compared to net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net revenue received in connection with higher unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products, which we began shipping in the second quarter of 2013. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2013 increased by 126% compared to net revenue of $0.7 billion in 2012. The increase was primarily due to net revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products, which we began shipping in the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from server products. Net revenue from sales of server products decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower unit shipments, as well as lower average selling price due to challenging market conditions, which adversely impacted demand. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $399 million in 2014 compared to $295 million in 2013. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $614 million increase in cost of sales, a $64 million increase in research and development expenses and a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition, operating income in 2014 included an $8 million benefit from technology license revenue. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. 47 Table of Contents Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $295 million in 2013 compared to $18 million in 2012. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $702 million increase in cost of sales and a $12 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $112 million decrease in research and development expenses. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the commencement of unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products in the second quarter of 2013. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. All Other All Other revenue pertains to results from former businesses, which were immaterial in 2014, 2013 and 2012. All Other operating loss of $478 million in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million, stock-based compensation expense of $81 million, net restructuring and other special charges of $71 million, lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of $58 million, $14 million related to workforce rebalancing severance charges, $14 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and $7 million related to other expenses. All Other operating loss of $91 million in 2013 included stock-based compensation expense of $91 million, net restructuring and other special charges of $30 million and $18 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into licenses and settlements regarding patent-related matters, for which we received in aggregate $48 million in net cash, which we recorded as an offset to operating expenses. All Other operating loss of $1.2 billion in 2012 included a $703 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of $273 million related to the fee for GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations, $100 million of net restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense of $97 million, $14 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and $6 million related to our acquisition of SeaMicro, Inc. (SeaMicro) in 2012. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net and Income Taxes The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2014, 2013 and 2012. 2014 2013 2012 (In millions, except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 3,667 $ 3,321 $ 4,187 Gross margin 1,839 1,978 1,235 Gross margin percentage 33 % 37 % 23 % Research and development 1,072 1,201 1,354 Marketing, general and administrative 604 674 823 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 14 18 14 Restructuring and other special charges, net 71 30 100 Goodwill impairment charge 233 — — Legal settlements, net — (48 ) — Interest income 3 5 8 Interest expense (177 ) (177 ) (175 ) Other income (expense), net (69 ) (5 ) 6 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 5 $ 9 $ (34 ) 48 Table of Contents Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 33% in 2014 compared to 37% in 2013. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that was previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point as compared to $8 million in 2014 which had a less than one percentage point impact. Gross margin in 2014 was adversely impacted by lower average gross margins in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment driven by increased sales of lower margin semi-custom SoC products. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 37% in 2013 compared to 23% in 2012. Gross margin in 2012 included a $703 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, a lower of cost or market charge of $273 million and a $5 million charge recorded to cost of sales related to a legal settlement. Absent the effect of these charges, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 41% in 2012 compared to 37% in 2013. Gross margin in 2013 was adversely impacted by the lower average gross margins in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment primarily driven by lower margin semi-custom SoC products, which we began shipping in the second quarter of 2013. Gross margin in 2012 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products, codenamed “Llano,” which accounted for two gross margin percentage points. Gross margin in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of this previously reserved inventory, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $1.1 billion in 2014 decreased by $129 million, or 11%, compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $201 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, partially offset by a $64 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $9 million increase in the All Other category related to a workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $171 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, a $22 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses and a $10 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, where we expect to continue to increase our investment, increased primarily due to a $59 million increase in product engineering and design costs and a $3 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. Research and development expenses of $1.2 billion in 2013 decreased by $153 million, or 11%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $112 million decrease in research and development expense attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, a $37 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment and a $4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense recorded in the All Other category. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment decreased as a result of a $103 million decrease in product engineering costs and a $9 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment was primarily due to a $38 million decrease in product engineering costs and a $35 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses, partially offset by a $34 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. 49 Table of Contents Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $604 million in 2014 decreased by $70 million, or 10%, compared to $674 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to an $89 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, partially offset by a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $5 million increase in the All Other category related to a workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $61 million decrease in sales and marketing activities and a $25 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to an $8 million increase in sales and marketing activities and a $5 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $674 million in 2013 decreased by $149 million, or 18%, compared to $823 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $154 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment and a $6 million decrease in the All Other category due to the absence of SeaMicro acquisition-related costs recorded in 2012, partially offset by a $12 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $93 million decrease in sales and marketing activities and a $72 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $10 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expense. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Solutions segment increased primarily due to a $33 million increase in other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $20 million decrease in sales and marketing activities. Legal Settlements During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters for which we received in aggregate $48 million in net cash, which we recorded as an offset to operating expenses. At the time we entered into the agreements, we did not have any future obligations that we were required to perform in order to earn the settlement payments. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $14 million in 2014, $18 million in 2013 and $14 million in 2012. The decrease from 2013 to 2014 was due to the reduced amortization base amount of acquired intangible assets of ATI. The increase from 2012 to 2013 was due to amortization of the intangible assets of SeaMicro, which we acquired in 2012. Restructuring and Other Special Charges, Net Effects of Restructuring Plans 2014 Restructuring Plan In October 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve operating efficiencies. The plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6%, largely completed by the end of 2014, and an alignment of our real estate footprint with the reduced headcount, largely expected to be completed by the end of first half of 2015. We recorded a $57 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $6 million for contract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, 50 Table of Contents a non-cash charge. In accordance with the restructuring plan, we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately $13 million in 2015, primarily related to real estate actions. We made cash payments of $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and expect to make cash payments of $34 million and $8 million in 2015 and 2016, respectively. 2012 Restructuring Plan In the fourth quarter of 2012, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve our cost structure and to strengthen our competitiveness in core growth areas. The plan primarily involved a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We recorded restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million, which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the restructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2014 and 2013, we incurred costs of $3 million and $11 million, respectively, related to facility consolidation and site closures, which were partially offset by the release of estimated employee-related severance costs of $5 million and $2 million, respectively. The 2012 restructuring plan was largely completed as of the end of the third quarter of 2013. 2011 Restructuring Plan In 2012, we recorded an approximately $8 million for severance and costs related to certain employee benefits. The 2011 restructuring plan was completed as of the end of the first quarter of 2012. The following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2014 and 2013 and the remaining related liabilities recorded in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 27, 2014: Severanceand relatedbenefits Other exit Related Costs Total (In millions) Balance at December 29, 2012 $ 41 $ 17 $ 58 Charges (reversals), net (5 ) 11 6 Cash payments (33 ) (21 ) (54 ) Balance at December 28, 2013 3 7 10 Charges (reversals), net 42 16 58 Cash payments (19 ) (4 ) (23 ) Non-cash charges — (6 ) (6 ) Balance at December 27, 2014 $ 26 $ 13 $ 39 The following table provides a summary of each major type of cost associated with the 2014, 2012 and 2011 restructuring plans for the periods presented: 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Severance and benefits charges (reversals), net $ 42 $ (5 ) $ 95 Contract or program termination charges 6 — — Asset impairments 6 — 4 Facility consolidation and closure charges 4 11 1 Total $ 58 $ 6 $ 100 51 Table of Contents Sale and Leaseback Transactions In September 2013, we sold a light industrial building in Singapore and leased back a portion of the original space. We received net cash proceeds of $46 million in connection with the sale, which resulted in a $17 million gain that we recorded in the third quarter of 2013 and a deferred gain of $14 million (as of September 28, 2013) that is being amortized over the initial operating lease term. The initial operating lease term expires in September 2023 and provides for options to extend the operating lease for 4 years at the end of the initial lease term and for an additional 3.5 years thereafter. In September 2013, we also sold an office building in Austin, Texas. We received net cash proceeds of $10 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $5 million gain in the third quarter of 2013. In March 2013, we sold and leased back certain land and office buildings in Austin, Texas. We received net cash proceeds of $164 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $52 million charge in the first quarter of 2013. The operating lease expires in March 2025 and provides for one 10-year optional renewal. In March 2013, we also sold an office building in Markham, Ontario, Canada and leased back a portion of the original space through June 2013. We received net cash proceeds of $13 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $6 million gain in the first quarter of 2013. The net charge of $24 million recognized in 2013 related to the real estate transactions described above is recorded in the “Restructuring and other special charges, net” line item on the consolidated statements of operations. Executive Officer Separation In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded other special charges of $13 million. The amount primarily included $10 million due to the departure of our former CEO, of which $5 million was related to cash and $5 million was related to stock-based compensation expenses. The amount is recorded as “Restructuring and other special charges, net” on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest Income Interest income was $3 million in 2014 compared to $5 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average investments in marketable securities and a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate during 2014. Interest income was $5 million in 2013 compared to $8 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average investments in marketable securities during 2013. Interest Expense Interest expense of $177 million in 2014 was relatively flat as compared to $177 million in 2013 and $175 million in 2012. Other Income (Expense), Net Other expense, net, in 2014 was $69 million compared to $5 million of other expense, net, in 2013 and $6 million of other income, net, in 2012. In 2014, we recognized $69 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $61 million loss from debt repurchases and a $7 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 52 Table of Contents In 2013, we recognized $5 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $2 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a $2 million realized loss on sale of our auction rate securities (ARS) investments. In 2012, we recognized $6 million of other income, net, primarily due to other income recorded in the third quarter of 2012, partially offset by a $5 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a $4 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to one of our ARS investments. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $5 million and $9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and an income tax benefit of $34 million in 2012. The income tax provision in 2014 was primarily due to $7 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain US tax credits. The income tax provision in 2013 was primarily due to $9 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $3 million related to the reversal of previously recognized tax benefits associated with other comprehensive income, offset by $3 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits. The income tax benefit in 2012 was primarily due to a tax benefit of $36 million relating to our SeaMicro acquisition, a $1 million tax benefit for the tax effects of items credited directly to other comprehensive income, a $2 million tax benefit for Canadian tax credits and a $9 million tax benefit associated with the successful negotiation of a tax holiday in a foreign jurisdiction net of $14 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations. As of December 27, 2014, substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 27, 2014, in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 was allocated in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 3 $ 5 $ 8 Research and development 44 48 52 Marketing, general and administrative 34 38 37 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0 $ 81 $ 91 $ 97 During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows. Stock-based compensation expense of $81 million in 2014 decreased by $10 million as compared to $91 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower expense related to stock options and restricted stock granted in connection with our SeaMicro acquisition as most were becoming fully vested during 2014 and lower stock compensation expense as a result of our 2014 restructuring plan. 53 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation expenses of $91 million in 2013 decreased $6 million compared to $97 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a lower weighted average grant date fair value and lower stock compensation expense as a result of our 2012 restructuring plan, partially offset by the additional expense related to stock options and restricted stock granted in connection with our SeaMicro acquisition. As of December 27, 2014, we had $16 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.08 years. Also, as of December 27, 2014, we had $98 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units including performance-based restricted stock units that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.75 years. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 81% in 2014, 85% in 2013 and 92% in 2012. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2014 compared 2013 and 2012 was primarily driven by an increase in net revenue from domestic sales of our semi-custom SoC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity As of December 27, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.0 billion were lower compared to $1.2 billion as of December 28, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the final $200 million cash payment made in the first quarter of 2014 related to GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations for wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the timing of sales and related collections. During 2014, we also used $95 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Also, during 2014, we reclassified $45 million of our marketable securities that were previously classified as long-term to short-term as those were intended to be used for operations in the next twelve months. The percentage of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically was 89% as of December 27, 2014. Our debt and capital lease obligations as of December 27, 2014 were $2.2 billion as compared to $2.1 billion as of December 28, 2013. During 2014, we issued $600 million of 6.75% Notes, $500 million of 7.00% Notes, and received $75 million net proceeds from our Secured Revolving Line of Credit borrowings. During 2014, we repurchased and redeemed $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.125% Notes for $531 million in cash. As of the end of December 27, 2014, we did not have any 8.125% Notes outstanding. Also in 2014, we repurchased $487 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $529 million in cash, $50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Notes for $48 million in cash, and $25 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes for $24 million in cash. The repurchases of the 7.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes were funded with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced a restructuring plan to implement operating efficiencies. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with the savings from our restructuring plan and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next twelve months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. Over the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, 54 Table of Contents through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business. If market conditions deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $98 million in 2014. A net loss of $403 million in 2014 was primarily adjusted for $233 million of goodwill impairment charge, $203 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $81 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $61 million net loss on debt redemptions, $17 million of non-cash interest expenses primarily related to amortization of debt discounts on our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes, amortization of debt issuance costs and a software and technology license and $14 million non-cash net restructuring and other special charges. The net changes in operating assets as of December 27, 2014 compared to December 28, 2013 included a decrease in inventories of $199 million, largely driven by the lower of cost or market inventory adjustment and lower levels of inventory for our Computing and Graphics and semi-custom SoC products, a decrease in accounts receivable of $7 million, which was primarily due to timing of sales and collections, an increase in prepayments to GF of $113 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7 million. Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other decreased by $231 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $104 million decrease in accounts payable driven by timing of purchases and payments, a $73 million decrease in deferred income on shipments to our distributor customers and a $47 million decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. During 2014, our payables to GF, which included all amounts we owe to GF, decreased by $146 million as compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the final $200 million payment to GF made in the first quarter of 2014 related to GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations for wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable to GF due to timing of payments. Net cash used in operating activities was $148 million in 2013. A net loss of $83 million in 2013 was primarily adjusted for $236 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $91 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $31 million net loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and $25 million of non-cash interest expenses primarily related to amortization of debt discounts on our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes and amortization of debt issuance costs. The net changes in operating assets as of December 28, 2013 compared to December 29, 2012 included an increase in inventories of $322 million, largely driven by an increase in Computing and Graphics inventory as well as semi-custom SoC products due to our customers’ next generation game console ramps, an increase in accounts receivable of $200 million, which was primarily due to higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase in other assets of $92 million, primarily due to new software licenses and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $11 million. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased by $266 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to a $241 million increase in accounts payable driven by larger purchases of inventory to support higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, a $36 million increase in deferred income on shipments to our distributor customers, and a $28 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits, partially offset by a $39 million decrease in other liabilities, primarily due to a decrease in restructuring accruals and payments for technology licenses. During 2013, our payables to GF, which included all amounts we owe to GF, decreased by $89 million as compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily due to payments of $175 million related to GF’s limited waiver of exclusivity and $40 million related to GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations for wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by an increase of $126 million of payables related to wafer purchases. Net cash used in operating activities was $338 million in 2012. A net loss of $1.2 billion in 2012 was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of a $278 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, $260 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $97 million of stock-based compensation expense and $23 million of non-cash interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes. These charges were partially offset by a benefit of $40 million for deferred income taxes. The net changes 55 Table of Contents in operating assets as of December 29, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 included a decrease in accounts receivable of $290 million and an increase in inventories of $83 million, which were primarily due to lower sales during 2012. During 2012, our payable to GF, which included all amounts that we owe to GF, increased by $277 million as compared to 2011. The increase was due to cash obligations of $240 million related to the third amendment to the WSA and $175 million related to the limited waiver of exclusivity, partially offset by a decrease of $138 million in the amount of billings related to wafer purchases. Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other decreased by $232 million in 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily due to a $94 million decrease in accrued liabilities, a $92 million decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities, a $23 million decrease in other liabilities, a $15 million decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors and a $6 million decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $12 million in 2014, which consisted of a cash outflow of $95 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, offset by a net cash inflow of $83 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $455 million in 2013 and primarily consisted of net proceeds of $301 million from the purchase, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities and net proceeds of $154 million from sales and purchases of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $19 million in 2012. We had a net cash inflow of $404 million in 2012 from purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a net cash outflow of $281 million related to our SeaMicro acquisition, a cash outflow of $133 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and a cash outflow of $9 million related to other investing activities. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $46 million in 2014, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our 6.75% Notes of $589 million, our 7.00% Notes of $491 million and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $75 million, partially offset by $518 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 6.00% Notes, $522 million in payments to repurchase our 8.125% Notes, $48 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.75% Notes, $24 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.50% Notes and $3 million in payments for capital lease obligations. During 2014, we also received $8 million in net proceeds, primarily from U.S. government grants for research and development activities and $4 million from the exercise of employee stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities was $13 million in 2013, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $55 million, net proceeds from U.S. government grants for research and development activities and foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products of $11 million and $3 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan, partially offset by the repurchase of $50 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes (which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes) in open market transactions and $5 million in payments for capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $37 million in 2012, primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of our 7.50% Notes of $491 million, $23 million from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $14 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan, partially offset by our repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest on our 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 and repayment of capital lease obligations of $489 million. 56 Table of Contents During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows for these periods. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 27, 2014, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period (In millions) Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020and thereafter 6.00% Notes $ 42 $ 42 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — 6.75% Notes 600 — — — — 600 — 7.75% Notes 450 — — — — — 450 7.50% Notes 475 — — — — — 475 7.00% Notes 500 — — — — — 500 Secured Revolving Line of Credit 130 130 — — — — — Other long-term liabilities 68 — 35 31 1 — 1 Aggregate interest obligation(1) 1,037 150 148 148 148 126 317 Capital lease obligations(2) 12 5 6 1 — — — Operating leases 340 50 46 43 41 27 133 Purchase obligations(3) 688 542 50 71 25 — — Obligations to GF(4) 80 80 — — — — — Total contractual obligations $ 4,422 $ 999 $ 285 $ 294 $ 215 $ 753 $ 1,876 (1) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding capital lease obligations. Also excludes non-cash amortization of debt discounts on our 6.00% Notes and amortization of debt issuance costs. (2) Includes principal and imputed interest. (3) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. In addition we have obligations for software technology and licenses where payments are fixed and non-cancelable which are also included in the table above. (4) Represents our payment obligations to GF as of the end of our fiscal year for wafer receipts and research and development activities. We negotiate our purchase commitments with GF on an annual basis and as such we cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future payment obligations to GF. We are currently in the process of negotiating a fifth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 On April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. Our 6.00% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015. The terms of our 6.00% Notes are governed by an indenture dated April 27, 2007, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.

At any time before August 15, 2022, we may redeem some or all of our 7.50% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as set forth in the 7.50% Indenture). As of December 27, 2014, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes was $475 million. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding our 7.50% Notes. 7.00% Senior Notes Due 2024 On June 16, 2014, we issued $500 million of 7.00% Notes. The 7.00% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year beginning January 1, 2015 until the maturity date of July 1, 2024. The 7.00% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.00% Indenture) dated June 16, 2014 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. At any time before July 1, 2017, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% Notes within 90 days of the closing of an equity offering with the net proceeds thereof at a redemption price equal to 107.000% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. Prior to July 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of the 7.00% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as set forth in the 7.00% Indenture). Starting July 1, 2019, we may redeem our 7.00% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price as Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 103.500 % Beginning on July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 102.333 % Beginning on July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 101.167 % On July 1, 2022 and thereafter 100.000 % As of December 27, 2014, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes was $500 million. 59 Table of Contents See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding our 7.00% Notes. Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 6.00% Notes, 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes and 7.00% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Secured Revolving Line of Credit We and our subsidiary, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (together, the Borrowers), entered into a loan and security agreement on November 12, 2013, as amended on December 11, 2014 (the Loan Agreement) for our Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount of up to $500 million, with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, with a group of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., acting as agent for the lenders (the Agent). Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit matures on November 12, 2018. Borrowings under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit are limited to up to 85% of eligible account receivable minus certain reserves and may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs. The Borrowers can elect that the borrowings under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit may bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (a) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.75%, or (b) (i) the greater of (x) the Agent’s prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50%, and (z) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.00%, plus (ii) an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%. The applicable margin to be applied to the borrowings under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit is dependent on the Borrowers achieving a certain fixed charge coverage ratio. Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be optionally prepaid or terminated or unutilized commitments may be reduced, in each case at any time without premium or penalty. In connection with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, the Borrowers are required to pay an unused line fee equal to 0.50% per annum, payable monthly on the unused amount of the commitments under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The unused line fee decreases to 0.375% per annum when more than 50% of our Secured Revolving Line of Credit is utilized. The Borrowers will pay (i) a monthly fee on all letters of credit outstanding under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit equal to the applicable LIBOR margin and (ii) a fronting fee to the Agent equal to 0.125% of all such letters of credit, payable monthly in arrears. The obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority basis in the Borrowers’ account receivable, inventory and certain deposit accounts and specified related assets. The Loan Agreement contains covenants that place certain restrictions on the Borrowers’ ability to, among other things, amend or modify certain terms of any debt of $50 million or more or subordinated debt, create or suffer to exist any liens upon accounts or inventory, sell or transfer any of Borrowers’ accounts or inventory other than certain ordinary-course transfers, make certain changes to either Borrower’s name or form or state of organization without notifying the Agent, or liquidate, dissolve, merge, combine or consolidate. Further restrictions apply during a domestic cash trigger period (a Domestic Cash Trigger Period), which occurs (i) upon an event of default or (ii) when the amount of domestic cash or cash equivalents held in certain accounts is at any time less than $250 million, and ends when both (a) no event of default has existed for 45 days and (b) the amount of domestic cash or cash equivalents held in such accounts has been equal to or greater than $250 million for 45 days. Such restrictions limit the Borrowers’ ability to, among other things, allow certain subsidiaries that manufacture or process inventory for the Borrowers to borrow secured debt or unsecured debt beyond a certain amount, create any liens upon any of the Borrowers’ property (other than customary permitted liens and liens on up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt (which amount includes our Secured Revolving Line of Credit)), declare or make any distributions, create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any 60 Table of Contents upstream payments, make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions, make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date, become a party to certain agreements restricting the Borrowers’ ability to incur or repay debt, grant liens, make distributions, or modify loan agreements or enter into any non-arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate. During a Domestic Cash Trigger Period, the Borrowers are subject to financial covenants requirement and are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 for each trailing four-fiscal quarter period ending on and after March 29, 2014. At December 27, 2014, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $130 million, with an interest rate of 4.25%, $6 million related to outstanding Letters of Credit, and up to $364 million available for future borrowings. As of December 27, 2014, we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Loan Agreement. The agreements governing our 6.00% Notes, 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above primarily consisted of $67 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2018. Other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above exclude amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 27, 2014, primarily consisted of $17 million of deferred gains resulting from certain real estate transactions that occurred in Sunnyvale, California in 1998, in Markham, Ontario, Canada in 2008 and in Singapore in 2013. Deferred rent related to our facilities in Sunnyvale, California of $7 million and accruals related to facility consolidation and site closure costs under our 2012 restructuring plan of $6 million are excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above as they are included in the operating leases obligations. Also excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above are $5 million of environmental reserves and $3 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which represent potential cash payments that could be payable by us upon settlements with the related authorities. We have not included these amounts in the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of the settlements with the related authorities, if any. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 27, 2014, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $12 million for one of our facilities in Canada, which is payable in monthly installments through 2017. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, and in some jurisdictions, we lease the land on which these facilities are built under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2025. We lease certain manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 27, 2014 were $340 million, including approximately $284 million of future lease payments and estimated operating costs related to real estate in Austin, Texas, Sunnyvale, California and Singapore that we sold and leased back. 61 Table of Contents Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties, excluding our wafer purchase commitments to GF under the WSA. As of December 27, 2014, total non-cancelable purchase obligations were $688 million. Obligations to GF Obligations to GF represent all of our expected cash payments to GF based on wafer receipts and research and development activities. As of December 27, 2014, payments owed to GF were $80 million. We are currently in the process of negotiating a fifth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 27, 2014, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 27, 2014, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper, corporate bonds and money market funds. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 27, 2014, the majority of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 27, 2014, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2014. The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 27, 2014: 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 andthereafter Total 2014 Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 410 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 410 $ 410 Weighted-average rate 0.13 % — — — — — 0.13 % Variable rate amounts $ 4 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 4 $ 4 Weighted-average rate 5.68 % — — — — — 5.68 % Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts $ 235 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 235 $ 235 Weighted-average rate 0.30 % — — — — — 0.30 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 649 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 649 $ 649 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ 172 $ — $ — $ — $ 600 $ 1,425 $ 2,197 $ 2,031 Weighted-average effective interest rate 5.17 % — % — % — % 6.75 % 7.40 % 7.05 % 7.63 % Total Debt Obligations $ 172 $ — $ — $ — $ 600 $ 1,425 $ 2,197 $ 2,031 63 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy, which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying our strategy, from time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months. December 27, 2014 December 28, 2013 Notional Amount Average Contract Rate Estimated Fair Value Gain (Loss) Notional Amount Average Contract Rate Estimated Fair Value Gain (Loss) (In millions except contract rates) Foreign currency forward contracts: Canadian Dollar $ 143 1.1264 $ (5.0 ) $ 124 1.0409 $ (4.0 ) Malaysian Ringgit 42 3.5482 — — — — Indian Rupee 35 64.1608 (1.1 ) — — — Singapore Dollar 33 1.313 (0.4 ) — — — Taiwan Dollar 23 31.1284 (0.4 ) — — — Chinese Renminbi 22 6.1906 0.1 — — — Total $ 298 $ (6.8 ) $ 124 $ (4.0 ) In addition, we use fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by converting fixed rate interest payments of a portion of our 6.75% Notes to floating rate interest payments based on LIBOR. The notional amount of the interest rate swap we entered into was $250 million as of December 27, 2014. The interest rate swaps are designated as a fair value hedge. All changes in fair value of the swaps are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets with no net impact to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. 64 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:45:31.918368
2488,AMD,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,2021,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”IntroductionIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019.OverviewDuring 2020, we continued to build on our technical, operational and financial foundation to drive our long-term growth strategy. We delivered strong financial results and further extended our industry-leading product portfolio despite the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenue for 2020 was $9.8 billion, an increase of 45% compared to 2019 net revenue of $6.7 billion. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2020, was 45%, compared to 43% in 2019. Our operating income for 2020 improved to $1.4 billion compared to operating income of $631 million for 2019. Our net income for 2020 improved to $2.5 billion compared to $341 million in the prior year. We recognized a $1.3 billion income tax benefit upon the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. We made significant progress towards improving our balance sheet in 2020. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 26, 2020 were $2.3 billion, compared to $1.5 billion at the end of 2019. The aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 26, 2020 was $338 million, compared to $563 million as of December 28, 2019.During 2020, we consistently executed our product roadmap and launched multiple products in leading-edge manufacturing technologies. We introduced a number of 7 nanometer (nm) products during the year, including new additions to our 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen™ desktop processor family, the AMD Ryzen 3 3100 and AMD Ryzen 3 3300X for the mainstream market, and the AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT, AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT and AMD Ryzen 5 3600XT processors for the enthusiast market. In July 2020, we introduced the AMD Ryzen Threadripper™ PRO Processor family designed for professional workstations from OEMs to system integrators and AMD Ryzen 4000 Series desktop processors with Radeon™ graphics for consumers, gamers, streamers and creators. We also introduced AMD Athlon™ 3000 Series desktop processors using the same Zen core architecture and built-in Radeon graphics as the AMD Ryzen desktop processor family. Also, the AMD Ryzen PRO 4000 series and AMD Athlon PRO 3000 series desktop processors were introduced for the commercial market. In October 2020, we introduced the AMD Ryzen 5000 Series desktop processor family powered by “Zen 3” core architecture. We also expanded our notebook products in 2020. In May 2020, we announced the global availability of the AMD Ryzen™ PRO 4000 Series Mobile family for commercial notebooks built with enterprise-grade AMD PRO technologies, which deliver a set of security and manageability features for Enterprise IT deployments. Also, we announced the AMD Ryzen 3000 C-Series mobile processors and the AMD Athlon 3000 C-Series mobile processors for Chromebook platforms designed for multi-tasking and content creation in distance learning and remote working. With respect to our graphics products, we expanded our professional offerings with the AMD Radeon™ Pro VII workstation graphics card designed for broadcast and engineering professionals. In August 2020, we announced the availability of the new AMD Radeon Pro 5000 series GPUs for the updated 27-inch iMac bringing a wide variety of graphically intensive applications and workloads to consumer and professional users. We also introduced the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture and designed for enthusiast-class PC gaming. In November 2020, we introduced our data center graphics processor, the AMD Instinct™ MI100 GPU accelerator, the first accelerator to use new AMD CDNA architecture dedicated to HPC workloads. We expanded our EPYC server family during the year. In April 2020, we announced the extension of the 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processor family with three new processors: AMD EPYC 7F32 (8 cores), AMD EPYC 7F52 (16 cores) and AMD EPYC 7F72 (24 cores). These new processors leverage up to 500 MHz of additional base frequency and large amounts of cache. In October 2020, we announced the AMD EPYC™ processor based Azure Dav4, Eav4, 39Easv4 and Lsv2 VMs for use to improve real-time analysis on large volumes of data streaming from applications, websites and more. We also expanded our embedded processor family with two new AMD Ryzen Embedded R1000 low-power processors that provide customers with a thermal design power (TDP) range of 6 up to 10 watts. In November 2020, we launched the AMD Ryzen Embedded V2000 series processor built on 7 nm process technology, “Zen 2” cores and high-performance AMD Radeon graphics.While the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, and we expect that it may continue to impact our business, we experienced limited financial disruption during 2020. Although many of our offices remained open to enable critical on-site business functions in accordance with local government guidelines, most of our employees worked from home during 2020. During the second half of 2020, the majority of our employees in China returned to work and we maintained normal business operations subject to local government health measures. We continue to monitor and take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, and support those employees who work from home so that they can be productive. We monitor demand signals as we adjust our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands. We also assess our product schedules and roadmaps to make any adjustments that may be necessary to support remote working requirements and address the geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19.As part of our strategy to establish AMD as the industry’s high performance computing leader, we announced in October 2020 that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. in an all-stock transaction. The transaction is currently expected to close by the end of calendar year 2021.We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Revenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our OEM customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.We base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both.Our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.Our estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.40We offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.We also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable.Overall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.Inventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.Goodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.We first analyze qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.41We regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. Through the end of 2020, we demonstrated consistent, continued and increasing profitability over the preceding three-year period. Our ability to sustain and grow our profitability is supported by the continued positive momentum of our consumer and commercial products, including our newly released desktop, mobile and graphics processors, greater market acceptance for our server products, the successful adoption of our new game console processor products, and our leadership in the continued development of HPC products. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we considered the highly dynamic and competitive landscape of our industry, the continued performance and market acceptance of our new products, and the impact of such market acceptance on our estimates of future profitability. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we concluded that our history of profitable operating results, including the current period results, along with increasingly favorable forecasts of continued future profitability, provided sufficient positive evidence supporting the realizability of a certain amount of our U.S. deferred tax assets, accordingly, the release of the related valuation allowance previously recorded against these deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.6 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to current limitations, including limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of income.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge could result.Results of OperationsWe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: the Computing and Graphics segment and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 14 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.42The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018.202020192018 (In millions)Net revenue:Computing and Graphics$6,432 $4,709 $4,125 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom3,331 2,022 2,350 Total net revenue$9,763 $6,731 $6,475 Operating income (loss):Computing and Graphics$1,266 $577 $470 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom391 263 163 All Other(288)(209)(182)Total operating income$1,369 $631 $451 Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics net revenue of $6.4 billion in 2020 increased by 37%, compared to $4.7 billion in 2019, primarily as a result of a 37% increase in unit shipments and a 2% increase in average selling price. The increase in unit shipments was primarily due to higher demand for our Ryzen processors. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of client processors from higher sales of our Ryzen processors, which have a higher average selling price, partially offset by lower average selling price for our Radeon products due to product cycle timing.Computing and Graphics operating income was $1.3 billion in 2020 compared to $577 million in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by the margin contribution from higher sales which more than offset higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $3.3 billion in 2020 increased by 65% compared to net revenue of $2.0 billion in 2019, primarily driven by higher sales of our EPYC server processors and higher semi-custom revenue.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $391 million in 2020 compared to $263 million in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the margin contribution from the increase in revenue which more than offset higher operating expenses in 2020 and a $60 million licensing gain recorded in 2019. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.All OtherAll Other operating loss of $288 million in 2020 included stock-based compensation expense of $274 million and acquisition-related costs of $14 million.All Other operating loss of $209 million in 2019 included $197 million of stock-based compensation expense and a $12 million contingent loss accrual on a legal matter.43Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Expense and Income TaxesThe following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2020, 2019 and 2018:202020192018 (In millions, except for percentages)Net revenue$9,763 $6,731 $6,475 Cost of sales5,416 3,863 4,028 Gross profit4,347 2,868 2,447 Gross margin45 %43 %38 %Research and development1,983 1,547 1,434 Marketing, general and administrative995 750 562 Licensing gain— (60)— Interest expense(47)(94)(121)Other expense, net(47)(165)— Income tax provision (benefit)(1,210)31 (9)Gross MarginGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 45% in 2020 compared to 43% in 2019. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors in 2020, which have a higher gross margin than the corporate average, partially offset by sales of semi-custom products and Radeon products, which have a lower gross margin than the corporate average.ExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $2.0 billion in 2020 increased by $436 million, or 28%, compared to $1.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in product development costs in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise and Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, due to an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $995 million in 2020 increased by $245 million, or 33%, compared to $750 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, and an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.Licensing GainDuring 2019, we recognized $60 million as licensing gain associated with the licensed IP to THATIC JV. See Note 4 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.Interest ExpenseInterest expense of $47 million in 2020 decreased by $47 million compared to $94 million in 2019, primarily due to lower debt balances.Other Expense, NetOther expense, net decreased in 2020 by $118 million from net of $165 million in 2019. Other expense, net for both periods primarily comprised of losses on redemptions, repurchases and conversions of our outstanding debt and convertible debt instruments.44Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)Through the end of 2020, we demonstrated consistent, continued and increasing profitability over the preceding three-year period. Our ability to sustain and grow such profitability is supported by the continued positive momentum of our consumer and commercial products including our newly released desktop, mobile and graphics processors, greater market acceptance for our server products, the successful adoption of our new game console processor products, and our continued leadership in the development of HPC products. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we considered the highly dynamic and competitive landscape of our industry, the continued performance and market acceptance of our new products, and the impact of such market acceptance on forecasts of future profitability. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we concluded that our history of profitable operating results, including the current period results, along with increasingly favorable forecasts of continued future profitability, provided sufficient positive evidence supporting the realizability of a certain amount of our U.S. deferred tax assets and, accordingly, the release of the related valuation allowance previously recorded against these deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.6 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to current limitations, including limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of income.We recorded an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020 and an income tax provision of $31 million in 2019. The income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table in the tax footnote.The income tax provision in 2019 was primarily due to $22 million of withholding taxes related to cross-border transactions and $22 million of foreign income taxes in profitable locations, partially offset by a $13 million benefit for a reduction of U.S. income taxes accrued in the prior year.International SalesInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 77% in 2020 and 74% in 2019. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 26, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.3 billion compared to $1.5 billion as of December 28, 2019. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 94% as of December 26, 2020, and 90% as of December 28, 2019. Our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:202020192018 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$1,071 $493 $34 Investing activities(952)(149)(170)Financing activities6 43 28 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash$125 $387 $(108)Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $338 million and $563 million as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively.45We believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance along with our Revolving Credit Facility entered into in June 2019 (refer to Note 6 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.Operating ActivitiesOur working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations are primarily cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to our net income of $2.5 billion, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $488 million and net cash outflows of $931 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $219 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.1 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher collections due to better revenue linearity in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, a $417 million increase in inventories driven by an increase in product build in support of customer demand, a $231 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to an increase in vendor credits, a $513 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, offset by a $574 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven by higher marketing accruals and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance.Net cash provided by operating activities was $493 million in 2019, primarily due to our net income of $341 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $694 million and net cash outflows of $542 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $623 million increase in account receivable driven primarily by $708 million higher revenue during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, a $137 million increase in inventories driven by an increase in wafer purchases during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and a $176 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to an increase in vendor credits and other non-current assets, partially offset by a $153 million increase in accounts payable due to an increase in inventory purchases and a $220 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven by higher marketing accruals.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $952 million in 2020, which primarily consisted of $850 million for purchases of short-term investments and $294 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $192 million for maturities of short-term investments.Net cash used in investing activities was $149 million in 2019, which primarily consisted of $217 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a net cash inflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $41 million.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities was $6 million in 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $85 million, partially offset by $78 million of common stock repurchased to cover employee withholding taxes on vesting of employee equity grants. We borrowed $200 million of short-term debt during the second quarter of 2020 and paid off the balance during the third quarter of 2020.Net cash provided by financing activities was $43 million in 2019, which primarily consisted of a cash inflow of $449 million from the warrant exercised by West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) and $74 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by $473 million of cash used for debt reduction activities during the year.46Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 26, 2020, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table:Payment due by period(In millions)Total202120222023202420252026 and thereafterTerm debt (1)$338 $— $312 $— $— $— $26 Aggregate interest obligation (2)54 25 25 1 1 1 1 Other long-term liabilities (3)159 55 64 19 10 8 3 Operating leases (4)284 52 55 48 41 34 54 Purchase obligations (5)3,032 2,971 7 15 15 15 9 Total contractual obligations (6)$3,867 $3,103 $463 $83 $67 $58 $93 (1)See Note 6 – Debt and Revolving Credit Facility of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.(2)Represents interest obligations, payable in cash, for our outstanding debt.(3)Amounts primarily represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses and IP licenses, including the payments due within the next 12 months.(4)See Note 16 – Commitments and Guarantees of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.(5)Represents purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above.(6)Total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other liabilities related to software and technology licenses and IP licenses.The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $119 million as of December 26, 2020. We have foreign and U.S. state tax audits in process at any one point in time. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 26, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.47ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 26, 2020, our investment portfolio consisted of time deposits and commercial paper. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.As of December 26, 2020, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 26, 2020, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019.
