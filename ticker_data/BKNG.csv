1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in ""Risk Factors."" OverviewWe are a leading online travel company that offers our customers hotel room reservations at over 210,000 hotels worldwide through the Booking.com, priceline.com and Agoda brands. In the United States, we also offer our customers reservations for car rentals, airline tickets, vacation packages, destination services and cruises through the priceline.com brand. We offer car rental reservations worldwide through rentalcars.com (formerly known as TravelJigsaw), which we acquired in May 2010. We launched our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to include the Booking.com, Agoda and rentalcars.com companies. Our principal goal is to serve our customers with worldwide leadership in online hotel and rental car reservations. Our business is driven primarily by international results. During the year ended December 31, 2011, our international business (the significant majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 78% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers), and approximately 88% of our consolidated operating income. Given that the business of our international operations is primarily comprised of hotel reservation services, gross profit earned in connection with the reservation of hotel room nights represents a substantial majority of our gross profit. Our priceline.com brand in the U.S. offers merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services (sometimes referred to as ""opaque"" travel services), which are recorded in revenue on a ""gross"" basis and have associated cost of revenue. Retail, or price-disclosed, travel services offered by both our U.S. and international brands are recorded in revenue on a ""net"" basis and have no associated cost of revenue. Therefore, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of our revenues between Name Your Own Price® and retail travel services. Gross profit reflects the net margin earned for both our Name Your Own Price® and retail travel services. Consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. At present, we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following sources:•Commissions earned from price-disclosed hotel room reservations, rental cars, cruises and other travel services;•Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our price-disclosed merchant hotel room and rental car reservation services;•Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservation, rental car and airline ticket services, as well as our vacation packages service; •Global distribution system (""GDS"") reservation booking fees related to both our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room reservation and rental car services, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and•Other gross profit derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites.Over the last several years we have experienced strong growth in the number of hotel room night reservations booked through our hotel reservation services. We believe this growth is the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the high growth of travel overall in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and South America, and the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to build hotel supply, content and distribution and to improve the customer experience on our websites. We experienced exceptionally strong year-over-year growth during 2011. However, given the sheer size of our hotel reservation business, we believe it is highly likely that our year-over-year growth rates will generally decelerate on a quarterly sequential basis in the future. Thus far during the first quarter of 2012, we experienced deceleration in year-over-year hotel room night reservation growth as compared to the year-over-year growth rate 33Table of Contentsin the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect to experience further deceleration in growth rates throughout 2012 and beyond. In addition, many governments around the world, including the U.S. and certain European governments, are operating at very large financial deficits. Governmental austerity measures aimed at reducing deficits could impair the economic recovery and adversely affect travel demand. Weak economic growth and elevated unemployment rates in the economies of such countries could cause, contribute to, or be indicative of, deteriorating macro-economic conditions. Recently, we have experienced volatility in the growth rates for transactions booked and cancellations for our international business. We have also observed a decline in transaction growth rates and weaker trends in hotel average daily rates (""ADRs"") for certain southern European countries, likely due to the impact of weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. This volatility makes it more difficult to predict longer-term trends and the future impact of macro-economic weakness on our business. Finally, higher oil prices are contributing to higher airline ticket prices and are likely to adversely impact consumer discretionary funds available to be spent on travel.Large, established Internet search engines with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic are creating - and intend to further create - inroads into online travel, both in the U.S. and internationally. For example, following its acquisition of ITA Software, Inc., a major flight information software company, Google recently launched a new flight search tool that enables users to find fares, schedules and availability directly on Google and excludes online travel agent (""OTA"") participation within the search results. Google has also invested in HomeAway, a publicly traded vacation home rental service, and launched ""Hotel Finder,"" a utility that allows users to search and compare hotel accommodations based on parameters set by the user. In addition, Microsoft has launched Bing Travel, which searches for airfare and hotel reservations online and predicts the best time to purchase them. ""Meta-search"" sites leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the searcher's specific itinerary across supplier, travel agent and other websites and, in many instances, compete directly with us for customers. Furthermore, certain suppliers limit OTA participation within the meta-search results. Some meta-search sites, such as Kayak.com, which offers its users the ability to make hotel reservations directly on its website, may evolve into more traditional online travel sites. These initiatives, among others, illustrate a clear intention to more directly appeal to travel consumers by showing consumers more detailed travel search results, including specific information for travelers' own itineraries, which could lead to suppliers or others gaining a larger share of search traffic or may ultimately lead to search engines maintaining transactions within their own websites. If Google, as the single largest search engine in the world, or Bing, or other leading search engines refer significant traffic to these or other travel services that they develop in the future, it could result in, among other things, more competition from supplier websites and higher customer acquisition costs for third-party sites such as ours and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Several major hotel companies, including Choice Hotels International, Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt, InterContinental Hotels Group, Wyndham Hotel Group and Marriott, have launched Room Key, a hotel search engine that competes directly with our hotel room night reservations services around the world. The hotel companies that own Room Key have a stated goal of driving demand directly to their brand web sites, thus reducing the share received by online travel agencies. They may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rates, better room availability or additional features or amenities through Room Key than are available through services like ours. If Room Key is successful, our share of the online hotel room night reservation market could be negatively affected in the United States and around the world and our business could suffer.Hotels also are increasingly offering hotel room reservations through ""daily deal"" websites such as Groupon and Living Social, which sell coupons to customers at a substantial discount. Expedia recently entered into a partnership with Groupon to sell hotel room reservations to Groupon customers under the ""Groupon Getaways"" brand name. If these new services are successful, we may experience less demand for our services and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rates.International Trends. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have trailed those of the United States. However, international consumers are rapidly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. We expect that over the long-term, international online travel growth rates will follow a similar trend to that experienced in the United States. In addition, the base of hotel suppliers in Europe and Asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. Our growth has primarily been generated by our international hotel reservation service brands, Booking.com and Agoda. Booking.com, our most significant brand, currently includes over 185,000 hotels and accommodations on its website as compared to about 120,000 hotels and accommodations last year (updated hotel counts are 34Table of Contentsavailable on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added hotels over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from both a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in these newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate. We believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the markets in which we operate. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the top online hotel reservation service provider in the world as measured by room nights booked.As our international operations have become significant contributors to our results and international hotel bookings have become of increased importance to our earnings, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in certain of our operating expenses and other financial metrics. For example, because Booking.com and Agoda utilize online search and affiliate marketing as the principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our online advertising expense has increased significantly over recent years, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2012 and beyond. In addition, certain newer markets in which we operate that are in earlier stages of development have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets, which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as these markets increase in size over time. Also, we intend to continue to invest in hotel additions. Many of these newer properties we add, especially in highly penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms or lower ADRs, and may appeal to a smaller subset of customers (for example, hostels and bed and breakfasts) and therefore may also negatively impact our margins over time.Another impact of the growing importance of Booking.com, Agoda and rentalcars.com is our increased exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Because we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States and are reporting our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency (principally the Euro and the British Pound Sterling) into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. A strengthening of the Euro increases our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars, while a weakening of the Euro decreases our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars. Greece, Ireland, Portugal and certain other European Union countries with high levels of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt. Concern around devaluation or abandonment of the Euro common currency, or that sovereign default risk may be more widespread and could include the U.S., has led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the Euro, the U.S. dollar and other currencies. We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. However, such derivative instruments are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross bookings, revenue or gross profit (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts). For example, while revenue from our international operations grew on a local currency basis by approximately 70% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, as a result of the positive impact of currency exchange rates, revenue from our international operations as reported in U.S. Dollars grew 79% year-over-year. Domestic Trends. Competition in domestic online travel remains intense and traditional online travel companies are creating new promotions and consumer value features in an effort to gain competitive advantage. In particular, the competition to provide ""opaque"" hotel services to consumers, an area in which priceline.com has been a leader, has become more intense over the recent past. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2010, Expedia began making opaque hotel room reservations available on its principal website under the name ""Expedia Unpublished Rates"" and has been supporting the initiative with a national television advertising campaign. In addition, in 2009, Travelocity launched an opaque price-disclosed hotel booking service that allows customers to book rooms at a discount. As with our Name Your Own Price® hotel booking service, for these services, the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after purchase. We believe these new offerings, in particular Expedia Unpublished Rates, have adversely impacted the market share and year-over-year growth rate for our opaque hotel service, which experienced a modest decline in room night reservations in 2011 compared to 2010. In addition, hotels are increasingly offering discounted hotel room reservations through ""daily deal"" websites such as Groupon and Living Social. If Expedia or Travelocity are successful in growing their opaque hotel service, and/or ""daily deal"" websites are successful in garnering a sizable share of discounted hotel bookings, we may have less consumer demand for our opaque hotel service over time and we are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rates. As a result, we believe our share of the discount hotel market in the U.S. could further decrease.We believe that for a number of reasons, including the recent significant year-over-year increase in retail airfares, consumers are engaging in increased shopping behavior before making a travel purchase than they engaged in previously. Increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes less likely to result in a purchase on our website, and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid online advertising channels than through free direct channels. 35Table of ContentsWhile demand for online travel services in the U.S. continues to experience annualized growth, we believe that the domestic market share of third-party distributors is impacted in part by a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing. The launch of Room Key discussed above is demonstrative of such efforts. In addition, certain suppliers have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book airline reservations through an online channel other than their own website. Suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as web-only fares, bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than models like ours.Some travel suppliers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to develop technology to bypass the traditional GDSs, such as enabling direct connections to the travel suppliers or using alternative global distribution methods. For example, in 2011, we enabled a direct connection with American Airlines. During 2011, American Airlines content was temporarily unavailable on Expedia and Orbitz due to disputes related to enabling a direct connection. We believe that this is consistent with an effort on the part of American Airlines, and the airline industry in general, to reduce distribution costs and could be indicative of the airlines in general becoming more aggressive in requiring online travel agents to implement direct connections. Development and implementation of the technology to enable additional direct connections to travel suppliers could cause us to incur additional operating expenses, increase the frequency/duration of system problems and delay other projects. In addition, any additional migration toward direct connections would reduce the compensation we receive from GDSs.Domestic airlines have reduced capacity and increased fares since the latter part of 2009, a trend which may continue. Decreases in capacity reduce the amount of airline tickets available, while significant increases in average airfares over the last two years have adversely impacted leisure travel demand. Reduced airline capacity and demand negatively impact our priceline.com air business, which in turn has negative repercussions on our priceline.com hotel and rental car businesses. Our rental car business is further impacted by decreases in rental car fleets, which has negatively impacted our Name Your Own Price® rental car service. We expect continued variability in the breadth and depth of discounted airline tickets and rental car rates made available to us in the future, depending on market conditions from time to time.Seasonality. A meaningful amount of retail gross bookings are generated early in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. However, we do not recognize associated revenue until future quarters when the travel occurs. From a cost perspective, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which bookings are generated. As a result, we typically experience our highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of booking and travel consumption for the year for our North American and European businesses. However, we experience the highest levels of booking and travel consumption for our Asia-Pacific and South American businesses in the first and fourth quarters. Therefore, if these businesses continue to grow faster than our North American and European businesses, our operating results for the first and fourth quarters of the year may become more significant over time as a percentage of full year operating results. In addition, Our Name Your Own Price® services are generally non-refundable in nature, and accordingly, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking is generated. However, we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel services, including Booking.com and Agoda, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel. Therefore, if our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors.Other Factors. We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our hotel business, to continue to promote the Booking.com, Agoda and rentalcars.com brands internationally and the priceline.com brand in the United States, and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into other international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, higher oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, volcanic eruptions (such as the April 2010 eruption of a volcano in Iceland), travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel related accidents or the withdrawal from our system of a major hotel supplier or airline, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above.For example, in early 2011, Japan was struck by a major earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency. Japan is an important source of travel demand for Agoda, and these crises have had an adverse impact on travel demand originating in Japan and demand for Japanese destinations. In October 2011, severe flooding in Thailand, a key market for our Agoda business and the Asian business of Booking.com, negatively impacted booking volumes and cancellation rates in this market. In addition, in early 2010, Thailand experienced disruptive civil unrest, which caused the temporary relocation of Agoda's Thailand-based operations. Future natural disasters or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operations 36Table of Contentsin Thailand. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to improve volume and sustain margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain gross profit growth and profitability.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:•Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Based on management's assessment of positive and negative evidence, we recorded non-cash tax benefits in 2009 of $183.3 million, resulting from the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2011 amounted to $147.8 million. The valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change, causing a reassessment of the amount of deferred tax assets more likely than not to be realized.•Accounting for State and Local ""Hotel Occupancy"" Taxes. As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently involved in over fifty lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax) and our ""merchant"" hotel business. We are also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to, among other things, the payment of hotel occupancy taxes and service fees. In addition, over sixty municipalities or counties, and at least six states, have initiated audit proceedings (including proceedings initiated by more than forty municipalities in California), issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax). Additional state and local jurisdictions are likely to assert that we are subject to, among other things, hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax) and could seek to collect such taxes, retroactively and/or prospectively. Historically, we have not collected hotel occupancy or other taxes on the gross profit earned from ""merchant"" hotel transactions; however, in a handful of jurisdictions, we have been recently required by passage of a new statute or court order, to start collecting and remitting certain taxes (local occupancy and/or sales tax) imposed upon our margin and/or service fee. The ultimate resolution of these matters in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have established an accrual for potential resolution of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. We accrue for legal contingencies where it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated; our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of gross profit represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. The ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. 37Table of Contents•Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient's service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance ""contingency"") which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results. Stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 includes charges amounting to $10.3 million and $13.4 million, respectively, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share units. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we periodically review actual and projected forfeitures. To the extent that actual or projected forfeiture rates differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised.•Valuation of Goodwill. We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded.A substantial amount of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of Booking.com. The estimated fair value for Booking.com, as well as our other reporting units, is substantially in excess of their respective carrying values. Since the annual impairment test in September 2011, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment. •Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset's future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value represents the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued guidance for new disclosure requirements regarding a company's rights of offset and related arrangements associated with financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new disclosures are designed to make financial statements that were prepared under U.S. GAAP more comparable to those prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""). The new disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods therein. Retrospective application is required. In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting update, which amends the guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If, based on the qualitative factors, it is more-likely-than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the unchanged two-step approach previously used would be required. The new accounting guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated, how goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit, or the requirements for testing goodwill annually or when events and circumstances warrant testing. The accounting update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption of the update is permitted. During the three months ended September 30, 2011, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing, and concluded that the estimated fair value for each reporting unit substantially exceeds its respective carrying value. This new accounting guidance will not have a significant impact on us. 38Table of ContentsIn June 2010, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income in financial statements by requiring comprehensive income to be reported in either a single statement or in two consecutive statements reporting net income and other comprehensive income. This accounting update also required reclassification adjustments out of other comprehensive income to be presented in both the income statement and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented, both in interim and annual periods. In December 2011, the FASB issued another accounting update which indefinitely defers the requirement to separately present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements. During the deferral period, a company that does not display reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements must disclose such adjustments in the notes to the financial statements. The accounting guidance did not change the items that constitute net income or other comprehensive income, the timing of when other comprehensive income is reclassified to net income, or the earnings per share computation. The accounting update requires retrospective application. Public entities will be required to adopt the guidance for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We intend to comply with the change in presentation of other comprehensive income in the financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2012. In May 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on fair value to largely achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The new accounting guidance does not extend the use of fair value but rather provides guidance about how fair value should be determined. For U.S. GAAP, most of the changes are clarifications of existing guidance or wording changes to align with IFRS. Amendments that clarify the Board's intent under existing requirements include: (a) use of the highest and best use and valuation premise concept should be limited to nonfinancial assets; (b) disclosure should include quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in a fair value measurement that is categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy; and (c) the fair value of an instrument classified in an entity's equity should be valued from the perspective of a market participant that holds that instrument as an asset. The amended guidance changes requirements as follows: (a) disclosures are expanded, particularly those relating to fair value measurements based on unobservable inputs, (b) fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities based on a net position are permitted if market or credit risks are managed on a net basis and other criteria are met, and (c) premiums and discounts are allowed only if a market participant would also include them in the fair value measurement. This accounting update is effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We expect to make the additional disclosures required in 2012.Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, reservations of hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked by our customers, and is widely used in the travel business. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings for our international brands and operations, and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings by our domestic operations, in each case without regard to the travel destination or the location of the customer purchasing the travel.Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our domestic and international operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ChangeDomestic$4.748 billion $4.166 billion 14.0%International16.909 billion 9.480 billion 78.4%Total$21.658 billion $13.646 billion 58.7% Gross bookings increased by 58.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, principally due to 52.6% growth in hotel room night reservation. The 78.4% increase in international gross bookings (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 70%) was attributable to growth in international hotel room night reservations for 39Table of Contentsour Booking.com and Agoda businesses, as well as higher average daily rates (""ADRs"") charged for hotel stays and growth in international car reservations for our rentalcars.com business, which was acquired in May 2010. Domestic gross bookings increased by 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to growth in gross bookings from our price-disclosed airline ticket and hotel room night reservation services and our Name Your Own Price® hotel room night and airline ticket reservation services. Higher ADRs drove growth in gross bookings related to our Name Your Own Price® hotel business despite a modest year-over-year decline in Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations for the year ended December 31, 2011. Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ChangeAgency$17.610 billion $10.781 billion 63.3%Merchant4.048 billion 2.864 billion 41.3%Total$21.658 billion $13.646 billion 58.7% Agency gross bookings increased 63.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, due to growth in the sale of Booking.com hotel room night reservations. Our U.S. priceline.com business experienced growth in reservations of agency price-disclosed hotel room nights, airline tickets and rental car days. Merchant gross bookings increased 41.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, due to an increase in gross bookings from our Agoda hotel room night reservation service, our rentalcars.com rental car reservation service, our priceline.com merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservation service and our Name Your Own Price® hotel room night, airline ticket and rental car reservation services. Higher ADRs drove growth in gross bookings related to our Name Your Own Price® hotel business despite a modest year-over-year decline in Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Booking.com, our most significant brand, currently includes over 185,000 hotels and accommodations on its website as compared to about 120,000 hotels and accommodations last year (updated hotel counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added hotels over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in these newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate. Our U.S. priceline.com price-disclosed hotel room night reservations benefited from the integration of U.S. hotels from the Booking.com extranet on the priceline.com website. Rental car days sold increased by 45.6% for the year ended December 31, 2011, over the same period in 2010, primarily due to the inclusion of rental car day reservations from rentalcars.com, which we acquired in May 2010, as well as an increase in Name Your Own Price® rental car reservations.Airline tickets sold increased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011, over the same period in 2010, due to an increase in both price-disclosed and Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservations. 40Table of ContentsRevenues •Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and therefore charge the customer's credit card for the travel services provided.

Agency RevenuesAgency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 69.4% compared to the same period in 2010, primarily as a result of growth in the business of Booking.com.

Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 8.5%, compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to the increase in Name Your Own Price® revenues discussed above. Merchant price-disclosed hotel room and car rental reservations are recorded in merchant revenues net of the amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there is no associated cost of revenues for merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of their associated merchant revenues decreased primarily due to the increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues and the addition of rentalcars.com merchant revenue, all of which are recorded on a ""net"" basis.Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues.Gross Profit Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeGross Profit$3,079,880 $1,908,971 61.3%Gross Margin70.7% 61.9% Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 61.3% compared to the same period in 2010, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010 because Name Your Own Price® revenues, which are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of total revenues compared to retail, price-disclosed revenues which are primarily recorded ""net"" with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported ""gross"" and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a ""net"" basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $2.6 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011, which compares to approximately $1.4 billion for the same period in 2010. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 70% in the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2010, primarily to support increased hotel room night reservations for Booking.com and Agoda, increased rental car day reservations for rentalcars.com and increased hotel room night reservations for priceline.com. Online advertising as a percentage of gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase is driven primarily 42Table of Contentsby brand mix rather than a change in the fundamental efficiency of our advertising by brand. Our international operations are growing faster than our priceline.com business in the U.S., and spend a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising, a trend which we expect to continue. Furthermore, the priceline.com brand is obtaining an increasing share of its traffic through online advertising, a trend which we also expect to continue. We recognize advertising expense as incurred at the time of booking, but recognize the gross profit for price-disclosed hotel room and rental car reservations when the travel is completed. Offline advertising expenses are related to our domestic television, print and radio advertising for priceline.com. For the year ended December 31, 2011, offline advertising was flat compared to the same period in 2010. We recognize expense for production costs of advertising the first time the advertising takes place. Sales and Marketing Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeSales and Marketing$162,690 $116,303 39.9%% of Total Gross Profit5.3% 6.1% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2011, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as expenses related to increased content translations. Our U.S. merchant business benefited from the impact of reduced credit card processing fees resulting from Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform and Consumer Protection Act (which amendment caps the interchange fee for debit card transactions and went into effect on October 1, 2011), partially offset by the impact of higher costs resulting from increases in foreign currency transactions and increased cancellation rates from our Agoda business. Costs associated with our U.S. priceline.com business comprise a large component of sales and marketing expenses. Our U.S. priceline.com business grew more slowly than our total gross profit, which benefited from the high growth in our international agency business, and as a result, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 declined compared to the same period in 2010. Personnel Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangePersonnel$352,295 $270,071 30.4%% of Total Gross Profit11.4% 14.1% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2011, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2010, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our international businesses. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included charges amounting to $10.3 million and $13.4 million, respectively, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for certain outstanding unvested performance share units. 43Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$123,652 $81,185 52.3%% of Total Gross Profit4.0% 4.3% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2011, over the same period in 2010, due to higher recruiting, training and travel expenses related to increased headcount at Booking.com, Agoda and rentalcars.com. Additionally, we have significantly increased our office capacity worldwide to support continued growth in our international operations. The year ended December 31, 2010 included a favorable expense adjustment of approximately $2.7 million in connection with the resolution of certain franchise and sales and use tax issues related to our corporate headquarters location, and a charge of $1.7 million related to a court ruling in South Carolina (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details).

For the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2010 was due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations.Depreciation and Amortization Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$53,824 $45,763 17.6%% of Total Gross Profit1.7% 2.4% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) amortization of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2011, depreciation expense increased from the same period in 2010 due principally to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com brand. We expect future capital expenditures to also be higher than historical prior year levels as we continue to invest to support business growth. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2011, amortization expense increased from the same period in 2010 due to acquisition-related amortization in connection with our acquisition of rentalcars.com in May 2010. 44Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense) Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeInterest Income$8,119 $3,857 110.5 %Interest Expense(31,721) (29,944) 5.9 %Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(7,526) (14,427) (47.8)%Total$(31,128) $(40,514) (23.2)% For the year ended December 31, 2011, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2010, primarily due to an increase in the average balance invested. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt resulting from the March 2010 issuance of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, and fees on the undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility entered into in October 2011. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operations into U.S. dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange gains of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to foreign exchange gains of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other.""Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, resulted in losses of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to losses of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other.""In addition, losses of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulted from convertible debt conversions during 2010, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other."" During the fourth quarter of 2011, we began classifying certain foreign currency processing fees, amounting to $2.2 million, as an offset to revenue earned from the third party that processes the payments for merchant hotel transactions.Income Taxes Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$308,663 $218,141 41.5% Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 22.6% and 29.2%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% principally due to lower foreign tax rates, the Innovation Box Tax benefit discussed below, and the resolution of an uncertain tax position during the second quarter of 2011. Following the conclusion of an audit, we reversed a reserve of approximately $12.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2011 for unrecognized tax benefits attributable to tax positions taken in 2010. We do not expect further significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2012. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is lower compared to 2010 primarily due to a higher percentage of foreign income, which is taxed at lower rates, the Innovation Box Tax benefit discussed below, and the reversal of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits referred to above. Effective January 1, 2010, the Netherlands modified its corporate income tax law related to income generated from qualifying ""innovative"" activities (the ""Innovation Box Tax""). Earnings that qualify for the Innovation Box Tax will effectively be taxed at the rate of 5% rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25.0%. Booking.com obtained a ruling from the Dutch tax authorities in February 2011 confirming that a portion of its earnings (""qualifying earnings"") is eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment. The ruling from the Dutch tax authorities is valid from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013 (the ""Initial Period""). In this ruling, the Dutch tax authorities require that the Innovation Box Tax benefit be phased in 45Table of Contentsover a multi-year period. The amount of qualifying earnings expressed as a percentage of the total pretax earnings in the Netherlands will vary depending upon the level of total pretax earnings that is achieved in any given year. In order to be eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment, Booking.com must, among other things, apply for and obtain a research and development (""R&D"") certificate from a Dutch governmental agency every six months confirming that the activities that Booking.com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are ""innovative."" Should Booking.com fail to secure such a certificate in any such period - for example, because the governmental agency does not view Booking.com's new or anticipated activities as ""innovative"" - or should this agency determine that the activities contemplated to be performed in a prior period were not performed as contemplated or did not comply with the agency's requirements, Booking.com may lose its certificate and, as a result, the Innovation Box Tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated. Booking.com intends to reapply for continued Innovation Box Tax treatment for future periods. There can be no assurance that Booking.com's application will be accepted, or that the amount of qualifying earnings or applicable tax rates will not be reduced at that time. In addition, there can be no assurance that the tax law will not change in 2012 and/or future years resulting in a reduction or elimination of the tax benefit.The Innovation Box Tax did not have a material impact on the our 2010 results. The impact of the Innovation Box Tax for 2011 reduced our consolidated effective income tax rate by approximately four percentage points. We currently estimate that our consolidated effective tax rate for 2012 will be lower by approximately four to six percentage points compared to what it would be if we did not have the benefit of the Innovation Box Tax. Until our domestic net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire, we do not expect to make tax payments on our U.S. income, except for U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes. However, we expect to pay foreign taxes on our foreign income. We expect that our international operations will grow their pretax income at higher rates than the U.S. over the long term and, therefore, it is our expectation that our cash tax payments will increase as our international businesses generate an increasing share of our pre-tax income. The Internal Revenue Service initiated an audit of our income taxes for the first time in the third quarter of 2011. To date, we have been audited in several taxing jurisdictions with no significant adjustments as a result. If future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests$2,760 $601 359.2% The net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 increased primarily due to the improved year-over-year operating performance for rentalcars.com.Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Operating and Statistical Metrics Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our domestic and international operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): 46Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 ChangeDomestic$ 4.166 billion $ 3.645 billion 14.3%International 9.480 billion 5.665 billion 67.3%Total$ 13.646 billion $ 9.310 billion 46.6% Gross bookings increased by 46.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, principally due to 52.3% growth in hotel room night reservations.

Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported ""gross"" and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a ""net"" basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $1.4 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010, which compares to approximately $848.6 million for the same period in 2009. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 77% in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009.49Table of ContentsOperating Expenses Advertising Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2010 2009 ChangeOnline Advertising$552,140 $365,381 51.1 %% of Total Gross Profit28.9% 29.0% Offline Advertising$35,714 $36,270 (1.5)%% of Total Gross Profit1.9% 2.9% Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, print and radio advertising; and (2) the cost for creative talent, production costs and agency fees for television, print and radio advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2010, offline advertising expenses were generally flat compared to the same period in 2009. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2010, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2009, primarily to support increased gross bookings for Booking.com, Agoda and priceline.com, as well as the inclusion of online advertising expense for TravelJigsaw since its acquisition in May 2010.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2009, primarily due to increased credit card processing fees, third-party service costs and bad debt provision associated with increased gross booking volumes.Personnel Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2010 2009 ChangePersonnel$270,071 $180,152 49.9%% of Total Gross Profit14.1% 14.3% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2010, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2009, primarily due to increased headcount to support the growth of our business, higher bonus accruals reflecting our strong operating performance, and the inclusion of TravelJigsaw since its acquisition in May 2010. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes charges amounting to $13.4 million, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for certain outstanding unvested performance share units. 50Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2010 2009 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$81,185 $68,555 18.4%% of Total Gross Profit4.3% 5.4% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) personnel-related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 included a favorable adjustment of approximately $2.7 million in connection with the resolution of certain franchise tax and sales and use tax issues related to our corporate headquarters location and a charge of $1.7 million related to a court ruling in South Carolina (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details). General and administrative expenses for the same period in 2009 included a charge of $3.7 million related to a judgment in a lawsuit involving hotel occupancy taxes. Excluding these items, general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2010, over the same period in 2009, due to professional fees incurred in the second quarter 2010 related to the acquisition of TravelJigsaw, increased personnel-related expenses and occupancy expenses to support the growth in our Booking.com and Agoda operations, and the inclusion of TravelJigsaw since its acquisition in May 2010, partially offset by a decrease in litigation expenses primarily related to hotel occupancy tax and other tax proceedings.Information Technology Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2010 2009 ChangeInformation Technology$20,998 $19,139 9.7%% of Total Gross Profit1.1% 1.5% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) outsourced data center costs relating to our domestic and international data centers; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2010, information technology expenses increased compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to growth in our worldwide operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2009, primarily due to acquisition-related amortization in connection with our acquisition of TravelJigsaw. 51Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense) Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2010 2009 ChangeInterest Income$3,857 $2,223 73.5%Interest Expense(29,944) (24,084) 24.3%Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(14,427) (6,672) 116.2%Total$(40,514) $(28,533) 42.0% For the year ended December 31, 2010, interest income increased over the same period in 2009, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of cash and marketable securities invested. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt. ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" includes foreign exchange gains of $3.0 million and losses of $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to foreign exchange derivative contracts. Foreign exchange transaction losses including fees on foreign exchange transactions were approximately $6.1 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The early conversion of convertible debt resulted in losses of $11.3 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Taxes Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2010 2009 ChangeIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit$(218,141) $47,168 (562.5)% Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was 29.2% and (10.7)%, respectively, and differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to lower foreign tax rates, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a benefit of $183.3 million, resulting from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards. Excluding the aforementioned $183.3 million benefit in 2009, the effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased over the same period in 2009, primarily due to a higher percentage of foreign income which is taxed at lower rates. Due to our domestic net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to make tax payments on our U.S. income for the foreseeable future, except for U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes. However, we expect to pay foreign taxes on our foreign income. We expect that Booking.com, Agoda and TravelJigsaw will grow their pretax income at higher rates than the U.S. over the long term and, therefore, it is our expectation that our cash tax payments will continue to increase as our international operations generate an increasing share of our pretax income. Effective January 1, 2010, the Netherlands modified its corporate income tax law related to income generated from qualifying ""innovative"" activities (the ""Innovation Box Tax""). Earnings that qualify for the Innovation Box Tax will effectively be taxed at the rate of 5% rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25.5% (25% as of 2011). Booking.com obtained a ruling from the Dutch tax authorities in February 2011 confirming that a portion of its earnings (""qualifying earnings"") is eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment. The ruling from the Dutch tax authorities is valid from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013 (the ""Initial Period""). In this ruling, the Dutch tax authorities require that the Innovation Box Tax benefit be phased in over a multi-year period. The Innovation Box Tax did not have a material impact on our 2010 results. The amount of qualifying earnings expressed as a percentage of the total pretax earnings in the Netherlands will vary depending upon the level of total pretax earnings that is achieved in any given year. In order to be eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment, Booking.com must, among other things, apply for and obtain a research and development (""R&D”) certificate from a Dutch governmental agency every six months confirming that the activities that Booking.com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are ""innovative."" Should Booking.com fail to secure such a certificate in any such period - for example, because the governmental agency does not view Booking.com’s new or anticipated activities as ""innovative"" - or should this agency determine that the activities contemplated 52Table of Contentsto be performed in a prior period were not performed as contemplated or did not comply with the agency’s requirements, Booking.com may lose its certificate and, as a result, the Innovation Box Tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated. After the Initial Period, Booking.com intends to reapply for continued Innovation Box Tax treatment for future periods. There can be no assurance that Booking.com’s application will be accepted, or that the amount of qualifying earnings or applicable tax rates will not be reduced at that time. In addition, there can be no assurance that the tax law will not change in future years resulting in a reduction or elimination of the tax benefit. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2010 2009 ChangeNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests$601 n/a n/a Noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2010, represents the proportionate share of the net income of TravelJigsaw Holdings Limited for the period of May 18, 2010 through December 31, 2010, applicable to the noncontrolling interests (refer to Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2011, we had $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Approximately $1.6 billion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held by our international subsidiaries and are denominated primarily in Euros and, to a lesser extent, in British Pound Sterling. We currently intend to permanently reinvest this cash in our foreign operations. We could not repatriate this cash to the U.S. without utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards and potentially incurring additional tax payments in the U.S. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of foreign and U.S. government securities and bank deposits. In October 2011, we entered into a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50%; or (ii) the greatest of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association's prime lending rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) an adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $50 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2011, there were no borrowings under the facility, and approximately $1.9 million of letters of credit were issued under the facility. Upon entering into this new revolving credit facility, we terminated our $175.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in 2007 (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).As of December 31, 2011, we have a remaining authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase $459.2 million of our common stock. We may from time to time make additional repurchases of our common stock, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, and other factors.Our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in deferred merchant bookings and supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our merchant transactions during the last few weeks of every quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $1.3 billion, resulting from net income of $1.1 billion and net favorable changes in working capital of $84.8 million, and a favorable impact of $197.9 million for non-cash items not affecting cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2011, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by $209.5 million, partially offset by a $125.8 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were 53Table of Contentsprincipally associated with deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of debt discount of our convertible notes. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $777.3 million, resulting from net income of $528.1 million and net favorable changes in working capital of $50.9 million, and a net favorable impact of $198.3 million for non-cash items not affecting cash flows. Non-cash items include deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, primarily from acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization of debt discount and loss on conversions of our convertible notes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by $84.8 million, primarily related to higher deferred merchant bookings and accrued expenses as our business continues to expand. Other changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2010 include an increase in other assets and liabilities of $17.8 million, principally related to an increase in long-term liabilities, partially offset by a $29.3 million increase in accounts receivable, and a $22.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the growth in the size of our business. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily related to the timing and amount of tax payments and increases in business volume.Net cash used in investing activities was $904.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 were affected by payments of $68.2 million for acquisitions, principally related to the contingent consideration associated with the 2007 acquisition of Agoda, $11.0 million net payments to settle derivative contracts, net purchases of investments of $775.8 million, and a change in restricted cash of $2.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $841.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 were affected by $741.4 million net purchases of marketable securities and a payment of $112.4 million for acquisitions and other equity investments, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $35.0 million net proceeds from foreign currency forward contracts and a $0.3 million change in restricted cash. Cash invested in purchase of property and equipment was $46.8 million and $22.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in 2011 is to support the growth of our business, including additional data center capacity and capital expenditures for new offices opened during the year, a trend we expect to continue to support business growth. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $151.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily related to treasury stock purchases of $163.2 million, approximately $13.0 million spent to purchase a portion of the shares underlying redeemable noncontrolling interests in rentalcars.com, and $0.2 million of principal paid upon the conversion of senior notes, partially offset by $4.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $21.0 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $213.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million, $43.0 million of proceeds from the termination of conversion spread hedges, $25.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $3.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and proceeds of $4.3 million from the sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $295.4 million paid upon the conversion of senior notes, $129.5 million of treasury stock purchases and $13.3 million of debt issuance costs. ContingenciesA number of jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against us related to, among other things, the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax). In addition, a number of municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes. To date, the majority of taxing jurisdictions in which we facilitate the making of hotel room reservations have not asserted that taxes are due and payable on our U.S. ""merchant"" hotel business. With respect to jurisdictions that have not initiated proceedings to date, it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statutes and seek to collect taxes from us only on a prospective basis. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these pending cases and proceedings, and Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Adverse application of state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation"" in this Annual Report.We are vigorously defending against these claims and proceedings. However, litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse developments in these pending or future cases and proceedings. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of these actions or proceedings could result in substantial liabilities for past and/or future bookings, including, among other things, interest, penalties, punitive damages and/or attorney fees and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows in any given operating period. Also, there have been, and will continue to be, ongoing costs associated with defending our position in pending and any future cases or proceedings.54Table of ContentsTo the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have a tax collection responsibility, or we determine that we have one, with respect to future transactions, we may collect any such additional tax obligations from our customers, which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservations to our customers and, consequently, could make our hotels services less competitive (i.e., versus the websites of other online travel companies or hotel company websites) and reduce hotel reservation transactions; alternatively, we could choose to reduce the compensation for our services on ""merchant"" hotel transactions. Either step could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.As a result of this litigation and other attempts by jurisdictions to levy similar taxes, we have established an accrual which amounted to approximately $33 million and $26 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The accrual is based on our estimate of the ultimate cost of resolving these issues. The actual cost may be less or greater, potentially significantly, than the liabilities recorded. We believe that even if we were to suffer adverse determinations in the near term in more of the pending proceedings than currently anticipated given results to date, because of our available cash, it would not have a material impact on our liquidity. The following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands)Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations $221,603 $32,539 $60,775 $46,883 $81,406Convertible debt(1) 584,284 584,284 — — —Revolving credit facility(2) 7,767 1,866 3,084 2,817 —Redeemable noncontrolling interests 127,045 71,145 55,900 — —Total(3) $940,699 $689,834 $119,759 $49,700 $81,406_____________________________(1)Convertible debt represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and interest of $9.3 million. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Represents fees on uncommitted funds and outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2011.(3)We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $39 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011, of which approximately $33 million related to our accrual for potential resolution of issues related to hotel occupancy and other hotel-related transaction taxes (refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and approximately $3 million related to unrecognized tax benefits (refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for these liabilities. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as ""non-current"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have excluded ""Other long-term liabilities"" in the amount of $39 million from the contractual obligations table because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. Since the contingent conversion threshold for the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 was exceeded as of December 31, 2011, these notes are convertible at the option of the holders. If the holders elect to convert, we will be required to pay the aggregate principal amount in cash and we will deliver cash or shares of common stock, at our option, for the conversion value in excess of the aggregate principal amount. We would likely fund our conversion obligations with cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue growth or sustained profitability will be realized or that future borrowings or equity sales will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. 55Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, the Priceline Group would also be affected by such changes.We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2011. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2011, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future.Fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our available for sale investments assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis points (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments as of December 31, 2011 of approximately $8 million. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity.As of December 31, 2011, the outstanding principal amount of our debt is $575 million. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2011. A substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount is related to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible bonds.As a result of the growth of Booking.com and Agoda, and the acquisition of rentalcars.com, we are conducting a significant portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euros). As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Booking.com, Agoda and rentalcars.com are subject to risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. Our derivative contracts principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. As of December 31, 2011, there were no outstanding derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2010, these derivatives, which were not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, resulted in a liability of $0.2 million, recorded in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"". Foreign exchange gains of $4.0 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and foreign exchange losses of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 were recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 56Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had outstanding forward currency contracts designated as hedging contracts for accounting purposes with a notional value of 860 million Euros and 378 million Euros, respectively, to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary. These contracts are all short-term in nature. Mark-to-market adjustments on these net investment hedges are recorded as currency translation adjustments. The fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2011 was an asset of $60.1 million and was recorded in ""Prepaid expenses and other current assets"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The net fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2010 was a net liability of $2.8 million, with assets of $4.0 million recorded in ""Prepaid expenses and other current assets"" and liabilities of $6.8 million recorded in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a derivative liability of approximately $34 million as of December 31, 2011.

Overview We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers hotel and accommodation reservations at over 295,000 properties worldwide (as of February 25, 2013) through the Booking.com, priceline.com and Agoda.com brands. In the United States, we also offer our customers reservations for car rentals, airline tickets, vacation packages, destination services and cruises through the priceline.com brand. We offer car rental reservations worldwide through rentalcars.com (formerly known as TravelJigsaw).We launched our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to include Booking.com, Agoda.com and rentalcars.com, which are independently managed and operated international brands. Our principal goal is to serve our customers with worldwide leadership in online hotel, accommodation and rental car reservations. Our business is driven primarily by international results. During the year ended December 31, 2012, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 82% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers), and approximately 92% of our consolidated operating income. Given that our international business is primarily comprised of hotel reservation services, and that hotel reservations also represent a significant majority of our domestic business, gross profit earned in connection with the reservation of hotel room nights represents a substantial majority of our gross profit. Our priceline.com brand in the United States offers merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services (sometimes referred to as ""opaque"" travel services because certain elements of the service are not disclosed to the customer prior to booking), which are recorded in revenue on a ""gross"" basis and have associated cost of revenue. Retail, or price-disclosed, travel services (including semi-opaque travel services) offered by both our U.S. and international brands are recorded in revenue on a ""net"" basis and have no associated cost of revenue. Therefore, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of our revenues between Name Your Own Price® and retail travel services. Gross profit reflects the net margin earned for both our Name Your Own Price® and retail travel services. Consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. At present, we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following sources:•Commissions earned from facilitating reservations of price-disclosed hotels, rental cars, cruises and other travel services;•Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our price-disclosed hotel, rental car, and vacation package reservation services;•Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our Name Your Own Price® hotel, rental car and airline ticket reservation services; •Global distribution system (""GDS"") reservation booking fees related to our Name Your Own Price® hotel, rental car and airline ticket reservation services, and price-disclosed airline ticket and rental car services; and•Other gross profit derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites.Over the last several years we have experienced strong growth in the number of hotel room night reservations booked through our hotel reservation services. We believe this growth is the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the high growth of travel overall in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and South America, and the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to build hotel supply, content and distribution and to improve the customer experience on our websites. We experienced strong year-over-year growth in recent years, though that growth has generally decelerated. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2012, our hotel room night growth was 38%, a substantial deceleration from 53% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Given the sheer size of our hotel reservation business, we believe it is highly likely that our year-over-year growth rates will continue to decelerate, though the rate of deceleration may not be consistent. For example, our fourth quarter 2012 room-night growth of 38% reflects slight acceleration from 36% in the 37third quarter of 2012, driven in part by high rates of growth in Asia-Pacific and South America, which typically represent a larger proportion of our business in the fourth quarter based on seasonality. However, we expect the long term deceleration trend to continue, and we therefore expect to experience further deceleration in growth rates in the first quarter of 2013 and beyond. Many governments around the world, including the U.S. government and certain European governments, are operating at very large financial deficits. Failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solutions to these issues has resulted in a high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook. This uncertainty, as well as concern over governmental austerity measures including higher taxes and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. Over recent quarters, we have experienced declines in transaction growth rates and weaker trends in hotel average daily rates (""ADRs"") across many regions of the world, particularly in those European countries that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainties. We believe that these business trends are likely impacted by weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. The uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior across regions, which may differ, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our results of operations.Large, established Internet search engines with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic are creating - and we believe intend to further create - inroads into online travel, both in the United States and internationally. For example, following its acquisition of ITA Software, Inc., a major flight information software company, Google launched a flight search tool that enables consumers to find fares, schedules and availability directly on Google and excludes participation by online travel agents (""OTAs"") such as us within the search results. Google has also invested in HomeAway, a publicly traded vacation home rental service, and launched ""Hotel Finder,"" a utility that allows consumers to search and compare hotel accommodations based on parameters set by the consumer and that Google has at times placed at or near the top of hotel-related search results. In addition, Microsoft has launched Bing Travel, which searches for airfare and hotel reservations online and predicts the best time to purchase them. ""Meta-search"" services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumer's specific itinerary across travel service provider (e.g., airlines or hotels), OTA and other websites and, in many instances, compete directly with us for customers. Furthermore, certain travel service providers limit OTA participation within the meta-search results. Some meta-search services that offer consumers the ability to make hotel reservations directly through their websites may evolve into more traditional OTAs. Meta-search services intend to appeal to consumers by showing more detailed travel search results, including specific information for their own itineraries than may be available through OTAs or other websites, which could lead to travel service providers or others gaining a larger share of search traffic or may ultimately lead to search engines executing transactions within their own websites. If Google (the largest search engine in the world), Bing or other leading search engines refer significant traffic to these or other travel services that they develop in the future, or otherwise favor supplier websites or other travel service websites over OTAs, including us, or if meta-search or travel research services limit our participation within their search results, it would likely become more difficult and expensive for us to generate traffic to our websites and therefore to maintain or grow our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Several major hotel companies, comprising Choice Hotels International, Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt, InterContinental Hotels Group, Wyndham Hotel Group, Marriott, La Quinta and Millennium, launched Room Key, an online hotel reservation service that competes directly with our hotel reservation services. The hotel companies that own Room Key have a stated goal of driving consumers directly to their brand websites, thus reducing the share received by OTAs. They may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rates, better room availability or additional features or amenities through Room Key than are available through services like ours. If Room Key is successful, our share of the online hotel room night reservation market could be negatively affected and our business could suffer.There has been a proliferation of new channels through which hotels can offer hotel room reservations. For example, some hotels offer room reservations through “daily deal” websites such as Groupon and Living Social, which sell coupons to customers at a substantial discount. In 2011, Expedia, one of our largest competitors, entered into a partnership with Groupon to sell hotel room reservations to Groupon customers under the “Groupon Getaways” brand name. New entrants, such as BackBid, GuestMob and Tingo, as well as Hipmunk and Room 77, have developed new and differentiated offerings that endeavor to provide savings on hotel rooms to consumers and that compete directly with us. If any of these new services are successful, we may experience less demand for our services and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rates. Widespread adoption of mobile devices, such as the iPhone, Android-enabled smart phones, and tablets such as the iPad, coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousands of useful “apps” available on these devices, is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platforms. We have experienced a significant shift of 38business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Our major competitors and certain new market entrants are offering mobile applications for travel products and other functionality, including proprietary last-minute discounts for hotel bookings. Advertising and distribution opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes. The gross profit earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, hotel reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance. We have made significant progress creating mobile offerings, which have received strong reviews, solid download trends, and are driving a material and increasing shares of our business. We believe that mobile bookings present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices instead of a personal computer and to mobile applications instead of a web browser. If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new and differentiated mobile offerings, and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants. Apple, Inc., one of the most successful companies in the world and producer of, among other things, the iPhone and iPad, recently obtained a patent for ""iTravel,"" a mobile app that would allow a traveler to check in for a travel reservation. In addition, Apple's most recent iPhone operating system includes ""Passbook,"" a virtual wallet app that holds tickets, boarding passes, coupons and gift cards, and along with iTravel, may be indicative of Apple's intent to enter the travel reservations business in some capacity. Apple has substantial market share in the smart phone category and controls integration of offerings, including travel services, into its mobile operating system. Apple also has more experience producing and developing mobile apps and has access to greater resources, than we have. Apple may use or expand iTravel, Passbook, Siri (Apple's voice recognition “concierge” service) or another mobile app as a means of entering the travel reservations marketplace. Similarly, Google's Android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world. As a result, Google could leverage its Android operating system to give its travel services a competitive advantage, either technically or with prominence on its Google Play app store or within its mobile search results. To the extent Apple or Google use their mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor their own travel service offerings, our business could be harmed.We use online search engines, price comparison and travel research services, and affiliate marketing as primary means of generating traffic to our websites. As a result, our online advertising expense has increased significantly in recent years, a trend we expect to continue. In addition, our online advertising has grown faster than our gross profit due to (1) brand mix within the Priceline Group, (2) channel mix within our brands and (3) recently, lower returns on investment (“ROIs”) from our online advertising. Our international brands are growing faster than our priceline.com U.S. brand, and spend a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. Furthermore, our brands are generally obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channels. Finally, our online advertising ROIs have recently been down year-over-year. Advertising efficiency is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability, including without limitation, ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign exchange rates and the extent to which we are successful in converting paid traffic to booking customers and then having customers return directly to our websites and mobile apps for future bookings. International Trends. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have trailed those of the United States. However, international consumers are rapidly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. We expect that over the long-term, international online travel growth rates will follow a similar trend to that experienced in the United States. In addition, the base of hotel properties in Europe and Asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. Our growth has primarily been generated by our international hotel reservation service brands, Booking.com and Agoda.com. Booking.com, our most significant brand, includes over 275,000 hotels and accommodations on its website as of February 25, 2013 (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added properties over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from both a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in these newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate. We believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the markets in which we operate. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the leading online hotel and accommodation reservation service provider in the world as measured by room nights booked.As our international business represents the substantial majority of our results, we expect to continue to see our operating expenses and other financial metrics largely driven by international performance. For example, certain newer markets in which we operate that are in earlier stages of development have lower operating margins compared to more mature 39markets, which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as these markets increase in size over time. Also, we intend to continue to invest in adding properties to our websites. Many of the newer properties we add, especially in highly penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms, lower ADRs or higher credit risk, and may appeal to a smaller subset of customers (for example, hostels and bed and breakfasts), and therefore may also negatively impact our margins over time.Another impact of the size of our international business is our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Because we are conducting a substantial majority of our business outside the United States and are reporting our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international business are translated from local currency (principally the Euro and the British Pound Sterling) into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. For example, a strengthening of the Euro increases our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars, while a weakening of the Euro decreases our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars. Greece, Ireland, Portugal and certain other European Union countries with high levels of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt. Concern around devaluation or abandonment of the Euro common currency, or that sovereign default risk may be more widespread and could include the United States, has led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the Euro, the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. However, such derivative instruments are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross bookings, revenue or gross profit (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts). For example, while revenue from our international business grew year-over-year on a local currency basis by approximately 48% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, as a result of the negative impact of currency exchange rates, revenue from our international business as reported in U.S. Dollars grew 39% for the year ended December 31, 2012. Domestic Trends. Competition in domestic online travel remains intense and online travel companies are creating new promotions and consumer value features in an effort to gain competitive advantages. In particular, the competition to provide ""opaque"" hotel reservation services to consumers, an area in which our priceline.com U.S. business has been a leader, has become more intense. For example, Expedia makes opaque hotel room reservations available on its principal website under the name ""Expedia Unpublished Rates"" and has supported this initiative with steeper discounts through lower margins. As with our Name Your Own Price® hotel booking service, the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after booking. We believe these offerings, in particular ""Expedia Unpublished Rates"", have adversely impacted the market share and year-over-year growth rate for our opaque hotel service, which experienced a decline in room night reservations in 2012 compared to 2011. This decline may have been exacerbated by a shift in our advertising in 2012 to focus on our non-opaque hotel reservation services. These and other competitors could also launch opaque rental car services, which could negatively impact our opaque Name Your Own Price® rental car service. In addition, some hotels offer discounted room reservations through ""daily deal"" websites such as Groupon and Living Social. If Expedia or others are successful in growing their opaque and semi-opaque hotel reservation services, and/or ""daily deal"" websites are successful in garnering a sizable share of discounted hotel bookings, we may have less consumer demand for our opaque and semi-opaque hotel reservation services over time, and we would face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rates. In an effort to compete more effectively against these new offerings, in 2012 we launched Express Deals, a semi-opaque price-disclosed hotel reservation service. However, Express Deals may not be successful at recovering or growing lost hotel reservation service market share. As a result, we believe our share of the discount hotel reservation market in the United States could further decrease.While demand for online travel services in the United States continues to experience annualized growth, we believe that the domestic market share of third-party distributors is impacted in part by a concerted initiative by travel service providers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing. The launch of Room Key discussed above is demonstrative of such efforts. In addition, certain airlines have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book airline reservations through an online channel other than their own website. Travel service providers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as web-only fares, bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than models like ours.Some travel service providers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to develop technology to bypass the traditional GDSs, such as enabling direct connections to the travel suppliers or using alternative global distribution methods. For example, in 2011, we enabled a direct connection with American Airlines. During 2011, American Airlines content was temporarily unavailable on Expedia and Orbitz due to disputes related to enabling a direct connection. We believe that this is consistent with an effort on the part of American Airlines, and the airline industry in general, to reduce distribution costs and could be indicative of the airlines in general becoming more aggressive in requiring OTAs to implement direct connections. Development and implementation of the technology to enable additional direct connections to travel service 40providers could cause us to incur additional operating expenses, increase the frequency/duration of system problems and delay other projects. In addition, any additional migration toward direct connections would reduce the compensation we receive from GDSs.Domestic airlines have reduced capacity and increased fares since the latter part of 2009, a trend which may continue. Decreases in capacity reduce the amount of airline tickets available, while significant increases in average airfares have adversely impacted leisure travel demand. Reduced airline capacity and demand negatively impact our priceline.com air ticket reservation business, which in turn has negative repercussions on our priceline.com hotel and rental car businesses. Our rental car business has also been impacted by an increase in the utilization of rental car fleets, resulting in less opaque rental car availability, which has negatively impacted our Name Your Own Price® rental car service. We expect continued variability in the breadth and depth of discounted airline tickets and rental car rates made available to us in the future, depending on market conditions from time to time.Seasonality. A meaningful amount of retail gross bookings are generated early in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. However, we generally do not recognize associated revenue until future quarters when the travel occurs. From a cost perspective, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which bookings are generated. As a result, we typically experience our highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of booking and travel consumption for the year for our North American and European businesses. However, we experience the highest levels of booking and travel consumption for our Asia-Pacific and South American businesses in the first and fourth quarters. Therefore, if these businesses continue to grow faster than our North American and European businesses, our operating results for the first and fourth quarters of the year may become more significant over time as a percentage of full year operating results. In addition, our Name Your Own Price® services are generally non-refundable in nature, and accordingly, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking is generated. However, we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel services at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel. Therefore, if our retail hotel business continues to grow faster than our Name Our Own Price® services, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors.Other Factors. We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into other international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, higher oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, volcanic eruptions (such as the April 2010 eruption of a volcano in Iceland), travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities or travel related accidents could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above.For example, in late 2012 Hurricane Sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern United States. In early 2011, Japan was struck by a major earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency. In October 2011, severe flooding in Thailand, a key market for our Agoda.com business and the Asian business of Booking.com, negatively impacted booking volumes and cancellation rates in this market. In addition, in early 2010, Thailand experienced disruptive civil unrest, which caused the temporary relocation of Agoda.com's Thailand-based operations. Future natural disasters or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operations.We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating leverage. We have experienced pressure on operating margins as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability.In November 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire KAYAK Software Corporation, a leading travel meta-search service, in a stock and cash transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction values KAYAK at $1.8 billion ($1.65 billion net of cash acquired) or $40 per share of KAYAK common stock, with $500 million to be paid in cash, which is expected to be made from cash on hand in the United States, and $1.3 billion to be paid in shares of our common stock and assumed stock options (subject to a volume-weighted average trading price calculation and a collar on the value of our common stock). The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013, pending approval from relevant regulatory authorities and KAYAK shareholders. 41Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:•Accounting for State and Local ""Hotel Occupancy"" Taxes. As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other related taxes (e.g., state and local sales tax and general excise tax) and our merchant hotel business. We are also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to, among other things, the payment of hotel occupancy taxes and service fees. In addition, over seventy municipalities or counties, and at least eight states, have initiated audit proceedings (including proceedings initiated by more than forty municipalities in California), issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other related taxes. Additional state and local jurisdictions are likely to assert that we are subject to, among other things, hotel occupancy and other related taxes and could seek to collect such taxes, retroactively and/or prospectively. Historically, we have not collected hotel occupancy or other taxes on the gross profit earned from merchant hotel transactions; however, in a handful of jurisdictions, we have been recently required by passage of a new statute or court order, to start collecting and remitting certain taxes (local occupancy and/or sales or excise tax) imposed upon our margin and/or service fee. The ultimate resolution of these matters in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have established an accrual for potential resolution of issues related to hotel occupancy and other related taxes for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. We accrue for legal contingencies where it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated; our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of gross profit represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. The ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. •Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient's service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance ""contingency"") which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results. Stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 includes charges amounting to $0.9 million, $10.3 million and $13.4 million, respectively, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share units. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we periodically review actual and projected forfeitures. To the extent that actual or projected forfeiture rates differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised.42•Valuation of Goodwill. We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded.A substantial amount of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of Booking.com. The estimated fair value for Booking.com, as well as our other reporting units, is substantially in excess of their respective carrying values. Since the annual impairment test in September 2012, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment. •Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset's future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value represents the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life.•Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. The deferred tax asset at December 31, 2012 amounted to $72.2 million. The valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change, causing a reassessment of the amount of deferred tax assets more likely than not to be realized.Recent Accounting PronouncementsOn January 1, 2012, we adopted the amended accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") concerning the presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance requires comprehensive income to be reported in either a single statement or in two consecutive statements reporting net income and other comprehensive income. We selected to present two consecutive statements. This amended guidance did not change the items that constitute net income or other comprehensive income, the timing of when other comprehensive income is reclassified to net income, or the earnings per share computation. In February 2013, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The new guidance requires that companies present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements, the effect of significant amounts reclassified based on its source and is effective for public companies in interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 13, 2012. We will comply with the new disclosure requirements beginning in the first quarter of 2013.In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting update, which amended the guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If, based on the qualitative factors, it is more-likely-than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the unchanged two-step approach previously used would be required. The new accounting guidance did not change how goodwill is calculated, how goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit, or the requirements for testing goodwill annually or when events and circumstances warrant testing. The accounting update was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. In September 2012, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing, and concluded that the estimated fair value for each reporting unit substantially exceeds its respective carrying value. In May 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on fair value to largely achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The new accounting guidance did not extend the use of fair value but rather provided guidance about how fair value should be determined. For U.S. GAAP, most of the changes were clarifications of existing guidance or wording changes to align with IFRS. The amended guidance expanded disclosure, particularly relating to fair value measurements based on unobservable inputs, permitted fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities on a net position if market or credit risks are managed on a net basis and other criteria are met, and allowed premiums and discounts only if a market participant would also include them in the fair value measurement. This accounting 43update was effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this accounting guidance, effective with the three months ended March 31, 2012, did not impact our consolidated financial statements or disclosure. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2012 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, reservations of hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked by our customers, and is widely used in the travel business. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings for our international brands and operations, and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings by our domestic operations, in each case without regard to the travel destination or the location of the customer purchasing the travel.Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our international and domestic operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 ChangeInternational$23,370 $16,909 38.2%Domestic5,086 4,748 7.1%Total$28,456 $21,658 31.4% Gross bookings increased by 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011 (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 37%), principally due to 39.5% growth in hotel room night reservations, partly offset by foreign currency impact and slower growth rates for our non-hotel businesses. The 38.2% increase in international gross bookings for the year ended December 31, 2012 (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 46%) was primarily attributable to growth in hotel room night reservations for our Booking.com and Agoda.com businesses, as well as growth in rental car reservations for our rentalcars.com business. Domestic gross bookings increased by 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to an increase in price-disclosed airline ticket reservations and associated higher airfares, as well as an increase in price-disclosed hotel room night reservations and associated higher average daily rates (""ADRs""). Retail rental car day reservations for our priceline.com business also increased in the year ended December 31, 2012. Our Name Your Own Price® hotel, air, and rental car businesses experienced a decline in reservations in the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 ChangeAgency$23,284 $17,610 32.2%Merchant5,172 4,048 27.8%Total$28,456 $21,658 31.4% Agency gross bookings increased 32.2% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due primarily to growth in Booking.com hotel room night reservations. Our U.S. priceline.com business also experienced 44growth in reservations of agency price-disclosed hotel room nights, airline tickets, and rental car days. Merchant gross bookings increased 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to an increase in Agoda.com hotel room night reservations and rentalcars.com rental car day reservations. Higher ADRs drove growth in merchant gross bookings related to our priceline.com price-disclosed hotel business, while our Name Your Own Price® hotel business experienced a decline in hotel room night reservations for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, due to the competitive pressures discussed above in Domestic Trends. Gross bookings related to Name Your Own Price® rental car reservations and airline ticket reservations also experienced a decline for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Year Ended Hotel RoomNights Rental Car Days Airline Tickets December 31, 2012 197.5 million 32.0 million 6.4 million December 31, 2011 141.6 million 23.8 million 6.2 million Hotel room night reservations increased by 39.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, principally due to an increase in Booking.com, Agoda.com and priceline.com price-disclosed hotel room night reservations, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations as a result of increased domestic competition in the opaque hotel room reservation market, including from Expedia's ""Expedia Unpublished Rates"" service. Booking.com, our most significant brand, includes over 275,000 hotels and accommodations on its website as of February 25, 2013 (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added properties over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in these newer markets, which are growing faster than our overall growth rate and our core European market. Our U.S. priceline.com agency hotel reservations benefited from the integration of hotels from the Booking.com extranet on the priceline.com website.Rental car day reservations increased by 34.9% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due primarily to an increase in rental car day reservations for our rentalcars.com business and priceline.com price-disclosed business, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® rental car day reservations due to limited availability of discounted supply as well as lower retail pricing. Airline ticket reservations increased by 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to an increase in price-disclosed airline ticket reservations partially offset by a decrease in Name Your Own Price® ticket reservations for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to limited availability of discounted supply. Revenues We classify our revenue into three categories: •Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the travel services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, GDS reservation booking fees related to certain travel services and customer processing fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Principally all of the revenue for Booking.com is comprised of travel commissions. •Merchant revenues are derived from services where we are the merchant of record and therefore charge the customer's credit card for the travel services provided. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night, rental car and airline ticket reservations and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by travel service providers in connection with (a) the hotel room reservations provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service at Agoda.com and priceline.com and (b) the reservations provided through our merchant semi-opaque rental car service at rentalcars.com and merchant semi-opaque hotel service at priceline.com, which allows customers to see the price of the reservation prior to purchase but not the identity of the travel service provider; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night, rental car and airline ticket reservations and merchant price-disclosed hotel 45reservations; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. •Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites.

Our U.S. agency revenues benefited from the integration of hotels from the Booking.com extranet on the priceline.com website as well as growth in our priceline.com retail rental car business.Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 5.0% compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to increases in our Agoda.com hotel business, rentalcars.com rental car business and priceline.com merchant price-disclosed hotel business, partially offset by a decline in our Name Your Own Price® businesses. Merchant revenue growth over the prior year period was substantially lower than merchant gross bookings growth because our merchant revenues are disproportionately affected by our Name Your Own Price® business. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and represented a smaller percentage, year-over-year, of total revenues compared to our faster-growing Agoda.com and rentalcars.com businesses, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of provider cost. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Other Revenues Other revenues consisted primarily of advertising revenues. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased compared to the same period in 2011.Cost of Revenues Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeCost of Revenues$1,177,275 $1,275,730 (7.7)%% of Merchant Revenues55.9% 63.6% Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2012, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of Name Your Own Price® rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (3) the cost of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 7.7%, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to a decrease in our Name Your Own Price® businesses. Merchant price-disclosed hotel room and car rental reservations are recorded in merchant revenues net of the amounts paid to travel service providers, and therefore, there is no associated cost of revenues for merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of merchant revenues decreased for the year ended December 4631, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, a trend we expect to continue, primarily due to the increase in Agoda.com and rentalcars.com revenues, all of which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of provider cost. Cost of revenues also includes approximately $21 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for an accrual recorded for the year ended December 31, 2012 related to hotel occupancy and other related taxes in the State of Hawaii and in the District of Columbia (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Agency revenues have no cost of revenue. Agency revenues principally consist of travel commissions on hotel reservations. Gross Profit Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeGross Profit$4,083,681 $3,079,880 32.6%Gross Margin77.6% 70.7% Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 32.6% compared to the same period in 2011, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by our Name Your Own Price® business. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in 2012 represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in 2011. Our retail price-disclosed businesses, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of provider cost, have been growing faster than our Name Your Own Price® businesses. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $3.6 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012, which compares to $2.6 billion for the same period in 2011. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 48% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Gross profit attributable to our priceline.com U.S. business increased by approximately 2% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Gross profit for our priceline.com U.S. business was negatively impacted by an accrual of approximately $21 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded for the year ended December 31, 2012 related to legal rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia pertaining to hotel occupancy and other related taxes (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Operating Expenses Advertising Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeOnline Advertising$1,273,637 $919,214 38.6%% of Total Gross Profit31.2% 29.8% Offline Advertising$35,492 $35,470 0.1%% of Total Gross Profit0.9% 1.2% Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (5) email campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2012, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2011, primarily to support increased hotel room night reservations for Booking.com and Agoda.com, increased rental car day reservations for rentalcars.com and increased travel reservations for priceline.com. Online advertising as a percentage of gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase is driven by (1) brand mix within the Priceline Group, (2) the channel mix within our brands and (3) recently lower returns on investment (""ROIs"") from our online advertising. Our international brands are growing faster than our priceline.com U.S. brand, and spend a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. Furthermore, our brands generally are obtaining an increasing 47share of traffic through paid online advertising channels. Finally, our online advertising ROIs have recently been down year-over-year.Offline advertising expenses are related to our television, print and radio advertising for our priceline.com U.S. business. For the year ended December 31, 2012, offline advertising was flat compared to the same period in 2011. Sales and Marketing Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeSales and Marketing$195,934 $162,690 20.4%% of Total Gross Profit4.8% 5.3% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2012, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2011, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as expenses related to increased content translations. The increase was partially offset by reduced credit card processing fees resulting from the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform and Consumer Protection Act (which amendment caps the interchange fee for debit card transactions and went into effect on October 1, 2011). Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of gross profit are typically higher for our merchant business which incurs credit card processing fees. Our merchant business grew more slowly than our agency business, and as a result, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross profit for year ended December 31, 2012, declined compared to the same period in 2011. Personnel Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangePersonnel$466,828 $352,295 32.5%% of Total Gross Profit11.4% 11.4% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2012, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2011, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our international businesses and the one-time wage tax levy of approximately $14 million described below. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $71.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included charges amounting to $0.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for certain outstanding unvested performance share units. In July 2012, the Dutch Government enacted certain amendments to Dutch tax law including, among other things, a one-time irrecoverable levy on an employer equal to 16% of an employee's 2012 earnings in excess of 150,000 Euros. The levy will be remitted to the tax authorities in 2013. The tax law amendments provide for this levy to automatically be repealed after 2013. This levy resulted in additional payroll taxes recorded in personnel expense of approximately $14 million (approximately $10 million after tax). Of the total additional payroll taxes, approximately $13 million were recorded in the third quarter of 2012. 48General and Administrative Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$173,171 $123,652 40.0%% of Total Gross Profit4.2% 4.0% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses; (2) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; and (3) occupancy expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 over the same period in 2011, primarily due to expansion of our office capacity worldwide to support continued growth in our international operations. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes approximately $3 million of professional fees related to the acquisition of KAYAK and a charge of approximately $3 million related to certain leased space that was vacated in connection with the relocation of Booking.com's headquarters to a new location in Amsterdam. Additionally, we have had higher recruiting, training and travel expenses related to increased headcount in all of our businesses. Information Technology Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeInformation Technology$43,685 $33,813 29.2%% of Total Gross Profit1.1% 1.1% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) outsourced data center costs relating to our U.S. and international data centers; (2) system maintenance and software license fees; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2011 was due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations.Depreciation and Amortization Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$65,141 $53,824 21.0%% of Total Gross Profit1.6% 1.7% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) amortization of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2012, depreciation expense increased from the same period in 2011 due principally to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com brand. We expect future capital expenditures to also be higher than prior historical levels as we continue to invest to support business growth. 49 Other Income (Expense) Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeInterest Income$3,860 $8,119 (52.5)%Interest Expense(62,064) (31,721) 95.7 %Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(9,720) (7,526) 29.2 %Total$(67,924) $(31,128) 118.2 % For the year ended December 31, 2012, interest income on cash and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2011, primarily due to lower yields partially offset by an increase in the average balance invested. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt resulting from the March 2012 issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, and fees on the undrawn $1.0 billion revolving credit facility entered into in October 2011. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange gains of $0.7 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, resulted in losses of $10.5 million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we began classifying certain foreign currency processing fees as an offset to revenue earned from the third party that processes the payments for merchant hotel transactions. Such processing fees recorded to ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 amounted to approximately $5.0 million. Income Taxes Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$337,832 $308,663 9.5% Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 19.2% and 22.6%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in the Innovation Box Tax benefit in 2012. Our effective tax rate differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to lower foreign tax rates, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. Effective January 1, 2010, the Netherlands modified its corporate income tax law related to income generated from qualifying ""innovative"" activities (the ""Innovation Box Tax""). Earnings that qualify for the Innovation Box Tax are taxed at the rate of 5% rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25.0%. Booking.com obtained a ruling from the Dutch tax authorities in February 2011 confirming that a portion of its earnings (""qualifying earnings"") is eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment. In this ruling, the Dutch tax authorities require that the Innovation Box Tax benefit be phased in over a multi-year period. The benefit is fully phased in for the Company starting in 2012. The amount of qualifying earnings expressed as a percentage of the total pretax earnings in the Netherlands will vary depending upon the level of total pretax earnings that is achieved in any given year. The ruling from the Dutch tax authorities is valid from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014, which includes a one year extension granted by the Dutch tax authorities in August 2012. In order to be eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment, Booking.com must, among other things, apply for and obtain a research and development (""R&D"") certificate from a Dutch governmental agency every six months confirming that the activities that Booking.com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are ""innovative."" The R&D certificate is current but should Booking.com fail to secure such a certificate in any future period - for example, because the 50governmental agency does not view Booking.com's new or anticipated activities as ""innovative"" - or should this agency determine that the activities contemplated to be performed in a prior period were not performed as contemplated or did not comply with the agency's requirements, Booking.com may lose its certificate and, as a result, the Innovation Box Tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated. Booking.com intends to apply for continued Innovation Box Tax treatment for future periods. Booking.com's application may not be accepted, or, if accepted, the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced or the applicable tax rate on qualifying earnings may be higher than the current rate at that time. In addition, the tax law may change resulting in a reduction or elimination of the tax benefit. Until our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire, we do not expect to make tax payments on our U.S. income, except for federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes. However, we expect to pay foreign taxes on our foreign income. We expect that our international operations will grow their pretax income at higher rates than the U.S. business over the long term and, therefore, it is our expectation that our cash tax payments will increase as our international businesses generate an increasing share of our pre-tax income. The Internal Revenue Service initiated an audit of our 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns for the first time in the third quarter of 2011. The audit was concluded in June 2012 with no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the audit). Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests$4,471 2,760 62.0% The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011 increased due mainly to improved year-over-year operating performance for the rentalcars.com business, partially offset by a reduction in redeemable noncontrolling interests from 19.0% in April 2011 to 12.7% in April 2012. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Operating and Statistical Metrics Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our international and domestic operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 ChangeInternational$16,909 $9,480 78.4%Domestic4,748 4,166 14.0%Total$21,658 $13,646 58.7% Gross bookings increased by 58.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, principally due to 52.6% growth in hotel room night reservation. The 78.4% increase in international gross bookings (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 70%) was attributable to growth in international hotel room night reservations for our Booking.com and Agoda businesses, as well as higher ADRs charged for hotel stays and growth in international car reservations for our rentalcars.com business, which was acquired in May 2010. Domestic gross bookings increased by 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to growth in gross bookings from our price-disclosed airline ticket and hotel room night reservation services and our Name Your Own Price® hotel room night 51and airline ticket reservation services. Higher ADRs drove growth in gross bookings related to our Name Your Own Price® hotel business despite a modest year-over-year decline in Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations for the year ended December 31, 2011. Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 ChangeAgency$17,610 $10,781 63.3%Merchant4,048 2,864 41.3%Total$21,658 $13,646 58.7% Agency gross bookings increased 63.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, due to growth in the sale of Booking.com hotel room night reservations. Our U.S. priceline.com business experienced growth in reservations of agency price-disclosed hotel room nights, airline tickets and rental car days. Merchant gross bookings increased 41.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, due to an increase in gross bookings from our Agoda hotel room night reservation service, our rentalcars.com rental car reservation service, our priceline.com merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservation service and our Name Your Own Price® hotel room night, airline ticket and rental car reservation services. Higher ADRs drove growth in gross bookings related to our Name Your Own Price® hotel business despite a modest year-over-year decline in Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Booking.com, our most significant brand, currently includes over 185,000 hotels and accommodations on its website as compared to about 120,000 hotels and accommodations last year (updated hotel counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added hotels over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in these newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate. Our U.S. priceline.com price-disclosed hotel room night reservations benefited from the integration of U.S. hotels from the Booking.com extranet on the priceline.com website. Rental car days sold increased by 45.6% for the year ended December 31, 2011, over the same period in 2010, primarily due to the inclusion of rental car day reservations from rentalcars.com, which we acquired in May 2010, as well as an increase in Name Your Own Price® rental car reservations.Airline tickets sold increased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011, over the same period in 2010, due to an increase in both price-disclosed and Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservations.52 Revenues Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeAgency Revenues$2,339,253 $1,380,603 69.4 %Merchant Revenues2,004,432 1,691,640 18.5 %Other Revenues11,925 12,662 (5.8)%Total Revenues$4,355,610 $3,084,905 41.2 % Agency RevenuesAgency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 69.4% compared to the same period in 2010, primarily as a result of growth in the business of Booking.com. Our U.S. agency hotel room night reservations benefited from the integration of U.S. hotels from the Booking.com extranet on the priceline.com website. Merchant RevenuesMerchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 18.5% compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to an increase in merchant revenues from our Agoda price-disclosed hotel room night reservation service, our rentalcars.com rental car reservation service, our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket and hotel room night reservation services and our priceline.com price-disclosed hotel room night reservation service.Other RevenuesOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted primarily of advertising. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased 5.8% compared to the same period in 2010. Cost of Revenues Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeCost of Revenues$1,275,730 $1,175,934 8.5%% of Merchant Revenues63.6% 69.5% Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2011, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of Name Your Own Price® rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (3) the cost of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 8.5%, compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to the increase in Name Your Own Price® revenues discussed above. Merchant price-disclosed hotel room and car rental reservations are recorded in merchant revenues net of the amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there is no associated cost of revenues for merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of their associated merchant revenues decreased primarily due to the increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues and the addition of rentalcars.com merchant revenue, all of which are recorded on a ""net"" basis.Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues.53Gross Profit Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeGross Profit$3,079,880 $1,908,971 61.3%Gross Margin70.7% 61.9% Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 61.3% compared to the same period in 2010, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010 because Name Your Own Price® revenues, which are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of total revenues compared to retail, price-disclosed revenues which are primarily recorded ""net"" with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported ""gross"" and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a ""net"" basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $2.6 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011, which compares to approximately $1.4 billion for the same period in 2010. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 70% in the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010. Operating Expenses Advertising Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeOnline Advertising$919,214 $552,140 66.5 %% of Total Gross Profit29.8% 28.9% Offline Advertising$35,470 $35,714 (0.7)%% of Total Gross Profit1.2% 1.9% Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (5) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2011, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2010, primarily to support increased hotel room night reservations for Booking.com and Agoda, increased rental car day reservations for rentalcars.com and increased hotel room night reservations for priceline.com. Online advertising as a percentage of gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase is driven primarily by brand mix rather than a change in the fundamental efficiency of our advertising by brand. Our international brands grew faster than our priceline.com U.S. brands, and spent a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. Furthermore, the priceline.com brand obtained an increased share of its traffic through online advertising. We recognize advertising expense as incurred at the time of booking, but recognize the gross profit for price-disclosed hotel room and rental car reservations when the travel is completed. Offline advertising expenses are related to our domestic television, print and radio advertising for priceline.com. For the year ended December 31, 2011, offline advertising was flat compared to the same period in 2010. We recognize expense for production costs of advertising the first time the advertising takes place. 54Sales and Marketing Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeSales and Marketing$162,690 $116,303 39.9%% of Total Gross Profit5.3% 6.1% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2011, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as expenses related to increased content translations. Our U.S. merchant business benefited from the impact of reduced credit card processing fees resulting from Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform and Consumer Protection Act (which amendment caps the interchange fee for debit card transactions and went into effect on October 1, 2011), partially offset by the impact of higher costs resulting from increases in foreign currency transactions and increased cancellation rates from our Agoda business. Costs associated with our U.S. priceline.com business comprise a large component of sales and marketing expenses. Our U.S. priceline.com business grew more slowly than our total gross profit, which benefited from the high growth in our international agency business, and as a result, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 declined compared to the same period in 2010. Personnel Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangePersonnel$352,295 $270,071 30.4%% of Total Gross Profit11.4% 14.1% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2011, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2010, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our international businesses. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included charges amounting to $10.3 million and $13.4 million, respectively, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for certain outstanding unvested performance share units. General and Administrative Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$123,652 $81,185 52.3%% of Total Gross Profit4.0% 4.3% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses; (2) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; and (3) occupancy expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2011, over the same period in 2010, due to higher recruiting, training and travel expenses related to increased headcount at Booking.com, Agoda and rentalcars.com. Additionally, we significantly increased our office capacity worldwide to support continued growth in our international 55operations. The year ended December 31, 2010 included a favorable expense adjustment of approximately $2.7 million in connection with the resolution of certain franchise and sales and use tax issues related to our corporate headquarters location, and a charge of $1.7 million related to a court ruling in South Carolina. Information Technology Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeInformation Technology$33,813 $20,998 61.0%% of Total Gross Profit1.1% 1.1% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) outsourced data center costs relating to our U.S. and international data centers; (2) system maintenance and software license fees; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2010 was due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations.Depreciation and Amortization Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$53,824 $45,763 17.6%% of Total Gross Profit1.7% 2.4% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) amortization of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2011, depreciation expense increased from the same period in 2010 due principally to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com brand. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2011, amortization expense increased from the same period in 2010 due to acquisition-related amortization in connection with our acquisition of rentalcars.com in May 2010. Other Income (Expense) Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeInterest Income$8,119 $3,857 110.5 %Interest Expense(31,721) (29,944) 5.9 %Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(7,526) (14,427) (47.8)%Total$(31,128) $(40,514) (23.2)% For the year ended December 31, 2011, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2010, primarily due to an increase in the average balance invested. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt resulting from the March 2010 issuance of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, and fees on the undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility entered into in October 2011. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operations into U.S. dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange gains of $4.0 million for the year 56ended December 31, 2011 compared to foreign exchange gains of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other.""Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, resulted in losses of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to losses of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other.""In addition, losses of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulted from convertible debt conversions during 2010, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other."" During the fourth quarter of 2011, we began classifying certain foreign currency processing fees, amounting to $2.2 million, as an offset to revenue earned from the third party that processes the payments for merchant hotel transactions.Income Taxes Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$308,663 $218,141 41.5% Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 22.6% and 29.2%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% principally due to lower foreign tax rates, the Innovation Box Tax benefit, and the resolution of an uncertain tax position during the second quarter of 2011. Following the conclusion of an audit, we reversed a reserve of approximately $12.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2011 for unrecognized tax benefits attributable to tax positions taken in 2010. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is lower compared to 2010 primarily due to a higher percentage of foreign income, which is taxed at lower rates, the Innovation Box Tax benefit, and the reversal of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits referred to above. The Innovation Box Tax did not have a material impact on our 2010 results. The impact of the Innovation Box Tax for 2011 reduced our consolidated effective income tax rate by approximately four percentage points. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2011 2010 ChangeNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests$2,760 $601 359.2% The net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 increased primarily due to the improved year-over-year operating performance for rentalcars.com. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2012, we had $5.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Approximately $3.1 billion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held by our international subsidiaries and are denominated primarily in Euros and, to a lesser extent, in British Pound Sterling. We currently intend to permanently reinvest this cash in our foreign operations. We could not repatriate this cash to the United States without utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards and potentially incurring additional tax payments in the United States. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of foreign and U.S. government securities and bank deposits. In October 2011, we entered into a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50%; or 57(ii) the greatest of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association's prime lending rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) an adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $50 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2012, there were no borrowings under the facility, and approximately $1.9 million of letters of credit were issued under the facility. As of December 31, 2012, we had remaining authorizations from our Board of Directors to repurchase $459.2 million of our common stock. We may from time to time make additional repurchases of our common stock, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, and other factors.Our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in deferred merchant bookings and supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our merchant transactions during the last few weeks of every quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012, was $1.8 billion, resulting from net income of $1.4 billion, a favorable impact of non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $217.9 million and net favorable changes in working capital of $143.8 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2012, were primarily related to a $256.0 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $105.3 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of debt discount. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $1.3 billion, resulting from net income of $1.1 billion and net favorable changes in working capital of $84.8 million, and a favorable impact of $197.9 million for non-cash items not affecting cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2011, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by $209.5 million, partially offset by a $125.8 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were principally associated with deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of debt discount of our convertible notes. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 were affected by net purchases of investments of $1.6 billion, payments of $33.9 million for acquisitions, and a change in restricted cash of $2.8 million, partially offset by net cash proceeds of $82.1 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts. Net cash used in investing activities was $904.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 were affected by payments of $68.2 million for acquisitions, principally related to the contingent consideration associated with the 2007 acquisition of Agoda.com, $11.0 million net payments to settle derivative contracts, net purchases of investments of $775.8 million, and a change in restricted cash of $2.9 million. Cash invested in purchase of property and equipment was $55.2 million and $46.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in 2012 was to support the growth of our business, including additional data center capacity and capital expenditures for new offices opened during the year, and we expect to see additional future increases to support the growth of our business. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $668.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, $2.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, and $5.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation partially offset by treasury stock purchases of $257.0 million, $61.1 million spent to purchase a portion of the shares underlying noncontrolling interests in rentalcars.com, and $20.9 million of debt issuance costs. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $151.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily related to treasury stock purchases of $163.2 million, approximately $13.0 million spent to purchase a portion of the shares underlying redeemable noncontrolling interests in rentalcars.com, and $0.2 million of principal paid upon the conversion of senior notes, partially offset by $4.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $21.0 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. 58In November 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire KAYAK Software Corporation, a leading travel meta-search service, in a stock and cash transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction values KAYAK at $1.8 billion ($1.65 billion net of cash acquired) or $40 per share of KAYAK common stock, with $500 million to be paid in cash, which is expected to be made from cash on hand in the United States, and $1.3 billion to be paid in shares of our common stock and assumed stock options (subject to a volume-weighted average trading price calculation and a collar on the value of our common stock). The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013, pending approval from relevant regulatory authorities and KAYAK shareholders. ContingenciesA number of jurisdictions in the United States have initiated lawsuits against online travel companies, including us, related to, among other things, the payment of hotel occupancy and other related taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax and general excise tax). In addition, a number of U.S. states, counties, and municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other related taxes. To date, the majority of taxing jurisdictions in which we facilitate the making of hotel room reservations have not asserted that taxes are due and payable on our U.S. merchant hotel business. With respect to jurisdictions that have not initiated proceedings to date, it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statutes and seek to collect taxes from us only on a prospective basis. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these pending cases and proceedings, and Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Adverse application of state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations."".We are vigorously defending against these claims and proceedings. However, litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse developments in these pending or future cases and proceedings. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of these actions or proceedings could result in substantial liabilities for past and/or future bookings, including, among other things, interest, penalties, punitive damages and/or attorney fees and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given operating period. Also, there have been, and will continue to be, ongoing costs associated with defending our position in pending and any future cases or proceedings.To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have a tax collection responsibility, or we determine that we have such a responsibility, with respect to future transactions, we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customers, which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel reservations to our customers and, consequently, could make our hotel reservation services less competitive (i.e., versus the websites of other online travel companies or hotel company websites) and reduce hotel reservation transactions; alternatively, we could choose to reduce the compensation for our services on merchant hotel transactions. Either action could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.As a result of this litigation and other attempts by jurisdictions to levy similar taxes, we have established an accrual which amounted to approximately $56 million and $33 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The accrual is based on our estimate of the probable cost of resolving these issues. The actual cost may be less or greater, potentially significantly, than the liabilities recorded. We believe that even if we were to suffer adverse determinations in the near term in more of the pending proceedings than currently anticipated given results to date, because of our available cash, it would not have a material impact on our liquidity.59 The following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2012 (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands)Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations $219,029 $31,487 $62,321 $47,121 $78,100Convertible debt(1) 1,639,283 597,200 20,000 20,000 1,002,083Revolving credit facility(2) 7,336 2,255 3,594 1,487 —Redeemable noncontrolling interests 160,287 160,287 — — —Total(3) $2,025,935 $791,229 $85,915 $68,608 $1,080,183_____________________________(1)Convertible debt represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and interest of $64 million. Convertible debt does not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or shares of common stock at our option. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Represents fees on uncommitted funds and outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2012.(3)We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $69 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012, of which approximately $56 million related to our accrual for potential resolution of issues related to hotel occupancy and other related taxes (refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and approximately $7 million related to unrecognized tax benefits (refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for these liabilities. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as ""non-current"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have excluded ""Other long-term liabilities"" in the amount of $69 million from the contractual obligations table because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. Since the contingent conversion threshold for the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 was exceeded as of December 31, 2012, these notes are convertible at the option of the holders. If the holders elect to convert, we will be required to pay the aggregate principal amount in cash and we will deliver cash or shares of common stock, at our option, for the conversion value in excess of the aggregate principal amount. We would likely fund our conversion obligations with cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2012, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-60term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2012. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2012, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future.Fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our available for sale investments assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis points (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments as of December 31, 2012 of approximately $14 million. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity.As of December 31, 2012, the outstanding principal amount of our debt is $1.6 billion. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2012. A substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount is related to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible bonds.As a result of the growth of Booking.com, Agoda.com, and rentalcars.com, we are conducting a significant portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euros). As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Booking.com, Agoda.com and rentalcars.com are subject to risks typical of international business, including differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. Our derivative contracts principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no such outstanding derivative contracts. Foreign exchange gains of $0.7 million, $4.0 million, and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, were recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had outstanding forward currency contracts with a notional value of 1.5 billion Euros and 860 million Euros, respectively, that are designated as hedges of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary for accounting purposes. These contracts are all short-term in nature. Mark-to-market adjustments on these net investment hedges are recorded as currency translation adjustments. The fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2012 was a liability of $62.4 million, with $62.6 million recorded in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" and $0.2 million recorded in ""Prepaid and other current assets"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2011 was an asset of $60.1 million and was recorded in ""Prepaid expenses and other current assets"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a derivative liability of approximately $262 million as of December 31, 2012.

1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2014,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include those discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.Overview We are a leading online travel company that connects consumers wishing to make travel reservations with providers of travel services around the world. We offer consumers accommodation reservations through our Booking.com, priceline.com, and Agoda.com brands. In the United States, we also offer consumers reservations for rental cars, airline tickets, vacation packages and cruises through the priceline.com brand. We offer rental car reservations worldwide through rentalcars.com. We also allow consumers to easily compare airline ticket, hotel reservation and rental car reservation information from hundreds of travel websites at once through KAYAK's websites and mobile applications (or ""apps""). We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands, including Booking.com, priceline.com, Agoda.com, KAYAK and rentalcars.com, collectively as ""The Priceline Group,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us.""We launched our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to include Booking.com, Agoda.com, KAYAK, and rentalcars.com, which are independently managed and operated brands. Our principal goal is to serve consumers with worldwide leadership in online travel services. Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of Booking.com, Agoda.com and rental cars.com, as well as the results of KAYAK's international based websites, in each case regardless of where the consumer is resident, from where the consumer makes a reservation or where the travel service is provided. During the year ended December 31, 2013, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 85% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers), and approximately 94% of our consolidated operating income. A significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. We derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following sources:•Commissions earned from facilitating reservations of accommodations, rental cars, cruises and other travel services;•Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our accommodation, rental car, and vacation package reservation services;•Advertising revenues primarily earned by KAYAK from sending referrals to travel service providers and OTAs as well as from advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps; and•Global distribution system (""GDS"") reservation booking fees related to our Name Your Own Price® accommodation, rental car and airline ticket reservation services, and price-disclosed airline ticket and rental car reservation services.The retail and semi-opaque travel services offered by our U.S. and international brands are recorded in revenue on a ""net"" basis and have no associated cost of revenue. Our priceline.com U.S. brand offers merchant Name Your Own Price® opaque travel services, which are recorded in revenue on a ""gross"" basis and have associated cost of revenue. Therefore, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of our revenues between Name Your Own Price® travel services and other travel services. Gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for our retail, Name Your Own Price® and semi-opaque travel services. Consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business because, in contrast to our revenues, it is not affected by the mix between our Name Your Own Price® travel services and our other travel services. Over the last several years we have experienced strong growth in our accommodation reservation services. We believe this growth is the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the widespread adoption of mobile devices, the high growth of travel overall in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and South America, and the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to build accommodation supply, content and distribution and to improve the customer experience on our websites and mobile apps. We experienced strong year-over-year growth in recent years, though that growth has generally decelerated. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2013, our accommodation room night reservation growth was 37%, a deceleration from 40% in 2012 and 53% in 2011. Given 40the size of our hotel reservation business, we believe it is highly likely that our year-over-year growth rates will continue to decelerate, though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate. Many governments around the world, including the U.S. government and certain European governments, are operating at large financial deficits, resulting in high levels of sovereign debt in such countries. Failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solutions to these issues has resulted in a high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook. This uncertainty, as well as concern over governmental austerity measures including higher taxes and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. At times, we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates and weaker trends in hotel average daily rates (""ADRs"") across many regions of the world, particularly in those European countries that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainties. We believe that these business trends are likely impacted by weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. Disruptions in the economies of such countries could cause, contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro-economic conditions. In addition, during periods of elevated uncertainty, the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to other currencies, including the Euro, has often increased, which adversely affects our gross bookings, gross profit, operating income and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars. The uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior across regions, which may differ, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our results of operations.We compete with both online and traditional travel reservation services. The market for the travel reservation services we offer is intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple and Facebook, have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us.We currently, or potentially will, compete with a variety of companies, including:•Online travel reservation services such as those owned by Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity, Ctrip, Rakuten, ODIGEO, Jalan and Wotif; •large online portal, social networking, group buying and search companies, such as Google, Facebook and Groupon;•traditional travel agencies, wholesalers and tour operators, such as Carlson Wagonlit, American Express, Thomas Cook and Tui Travel, as well as thousands of individual travel agencies around the world;•travel service providers such as accommodation providers, rental car companies and airlines; and•online travel search and price comparison services (generally referred to as ""meta-search"" services), such as trivago (in which Expedia has acquired a majority ownership interest), TripAdvisor, Qunar and HotelsCombined.TripAdvisor, the world's leading travel research and review website and the world's largest online travel service with over 260 million unique monthly visitors across its websites, Google, the world's largest search engine, and other large, established companies with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic have launched meta-search services and may create additional inroads into online travel, both in the United States and internationally. Meta-search services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumer's specific itinerary across travel service provider (e.g. hotels, rental car companies or airlines), OTA and other travel websites and, in many instances, compete directly with us for customers. Meta-search services intend to appeal to consumers by showing broader travel search results than may be available through OTAs or other travel websites, which could lead to travel service providers or others gaining a larger share of search traffic. TripAdvisor has begun supporting its meta-search service with offline advertising, and trivago, a leading meta-search service in Europe, recently expanded its offline advertising campaign into the United States. Google offers ""Hotel Finder"", a meta-search service that Google has at times placed at or near the top of hotel-related search results. As a result of our recent acquisition of KAYAK, a meta-search service, we now compete more directly with other meta-search services. As a meta-search service, KAYAK depends on access to information related to travel service pricing, schedules, availability and other related information from OTAs and travel service providers.As consumers attempt to be more efficient in their shopping behavior, they may favor travel services offered by meta-search websites or search companies over OTAs, which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation websites, increase consumer awareness of our competitors' brands and websites and increase our advertising and other customer acquisition costs. To the extent any such consumer behavior leads to growth in our KAYAK meta-search business, such growth may not result in sufficient increases in profits from our KAYAK meta-search business to offset any related decrease in profits experienced by 41our OTA brands. Further, meta-search services may evolve into more traditional OTAs by offering consumers the ability to make travel reservations directly through their websites. For example, TripAdvisor facilitates hotel reservations on its transactional websites Tingo and Jetsetter and intends to allow consumers to make a reservation while staying on TripAdvisor. To the extent consumers book travel services through a meta-search website or directly with a travel service provider after visiting a meta-search website or meta-search utility on a traditional search engine without using an OTA like us, or if meta-search services limit our participation within their search results, we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition costs to maintain or grow our reservation bookings, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Travel service providers, including multi-national hotel chains, rental car companies and airlines with which we conduct business, compete with us in online channels to drive consumers to their own websites in lieu of third-party distributors such as us. Travel service providers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than models like ours.Widespread adoption of mobile devices, such as the iPhone, Android-enabled smart phones, and tablets such as the iPad, coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousands of useful ""apps"" available on these devices, is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platforms. We have experienced a significant shift of business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Our major competitors and certain new market entrants are offering mobile applications for travel products and other functionality, including proprietary last-minute discounts for accommodation reservations. Advertising and distribution opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes. The gross profit earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance. Further, given the device sizes and technical limitations of tablets and smartphones, mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple travel service providers and instead prefer to use one or a limited number of apps for their mobile travel activity. As a result, the consumer experience with mobile apps as well as brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important. We have made significant progress creating mobile offerings, which have received strong reviews and solid download trends, and which are driving a material and increasing share of our business. We believe that mobile bookings present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices instead of a personal computer and to mobile applications instead of a web browser. If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if our mobile apps are not downloaded and used by consumers, we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. Apple, Inc., one of the most innovative and successful companies in the world and producer of, among other things, the iPhone and iPad, obtained a patent for ""iTravel,"" a mobile app that would allow a traveler to check in for a travel reservation. In addition, Apple's iPhone operating system includes ""Passbook,"" a virtual wallet app that holds tickets, boarding passes, coupons and gift cards, and along with iTravel, may be indicative of Apple's intent to enter the travel reservations business in some capacity. Apple has substantial market share in the smart phone category and controls integration of offerings, including travel services, into its mobile operating system. Apple also has more experience producing and developing mobile apps and has access to greater resources than we have. Apple may use or expand iTravel, Passbook, Siri (Apple's voice recognition ""concierge"" service) or another mobile app as a means of entering the travel reservations marketplace. Similarly, Google's Android operating system is the leading smart phone operating system in the world. As a result, Google could leverage its Android operating system to give its travel services a competitive advantage, either technically or with prominence on its Google Play app store or within its mobile search results. To the extent Apple or Google use their mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor their own travel service offerings, our business could be harmed.There has been a proliferation of new channels through which accommodation providers can offer reservations. For example, some accommodations offer reservations through ""daily deal"" websites such as Groupon and Living Social, which sell coupons to customers at a substantial discount. In 2011, Expedia, one of our largest competitors, entered into a partnership with Groupon to facilitate accommodation reservations to Groupon customers under the ""Groupon Getaways"" brand name. New entrants, such as HotelTonight, BackBid, GuestMob, Tingo, Hipmunk and Room 77, have developed new and differentiated offerings that endeavor to provide savings on accommodation reservations to consumers and that compete directly with us. If any of these new services are successful, we may experience less demand for our services and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rates. 42In August 2013, Expedia and Travelocity announced that they had entered into an exclusive, long-term strategic marketing agreement, whereby Expedia will power the technology platforms for Travelocity's existing websites in the United States and Canada, while providing Travelocity access to Expedia's supply and customer services. To the extent this arrangement enhances Expedia's and/or Travelocity's ability to compete with us in the affected markets, our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected.We use third party websites, including online search engines (primarily Google) and meta-search and travel research services, and affiliate marketing as primary means of generating traffic to our websites. As a result, our online advertising expense has increased significantly in recent years, a trend we expect to continue. In addition, our online advertising expense has generally been growing faster than our gross profit due to (1) lower returns on investment (""ROIs"") from our online advertising, (2) brand mix within The Priceline Group and (3) channel mix within certain of our brands. Our online advertising ROIs were down year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2013. Furthermore, our international brands are generally growing faster than our U.S. brands, and typically spend a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. Finally, certain of our brands are obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channels. We also intend to continue to invest in offline advertising, in particular for our Booking.com, priceline.com and KAYAK brands, and expect to increase our overall offline advertising spend in 2014. For example, building on its first offline advertising campaign, which it launched in the United States in 2013, Booking.com recently began offline advertising campaigns in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom and may expand its offline advertising into other markets during 2014.The inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013 had a favorable impact on online advertising as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 because KAYAK spends a lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brands, and our consolidated results exclude intercompany advertising by our brands on KAYAK. This favorable impact will benefit year-over-year comparisons until the anniversary of the acquisition on May 21, 2014.Advertising efficiency is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are, in some cases, outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign exchange rates and our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers and then having customers return directly to our websites or mobile apps for future bookings. International Trends. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have trailed those of the United States. However, international consumers are rapidly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. We expect that over the long-term, international online travel growth rates will follow a similar trend to that experienced in the United States. In addition, the base of hotel properties in Europe and Asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. Our growth has primarily been generated by our international accommodation reservation service brands, Booking.com and Agoda.com. Booking.com, our most significant brand, includes over 425,000 properties on its website as of February 18, 2014 (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added properties over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from both a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in these newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate. We believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the markets in which we operate. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the leading online accommodation reservation service provider in the world as measured by room nights booked.As our international business represents the substantial majority of our financial results, we expect to continue to see our operating results and other financial metrics largely driven by international performance. For example, certain newer markets in which we operate that are in earlier stages of development have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets, which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as these markets increase in size over time. Also, we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodations available for reservation on our websites, including hotels, bed and breakfasts, hostels and vacation rentals. Vacation rentals generally consist of, among others, properties categorized as single-unit and multi-unit villas, holiday homes, apartments and chalets and are generally self-catered (i.e., include a kitchen), directly bookable properties. Many of the newer accommodations we add to our travel reservation services, especially in highly penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms, lower ADRs or higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of consumers (e.g., hostels and bed and breakfasts), and therefore may also negatively impact our margins. For example, because a vacation rental is either a single unit or a small collection of independent units, vacation rental properties represent more limited booking opportunities than non-vacation rental properties, which generally have more units to rent per property. Our non-hotel 43accommodations in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism seasons, weather or other factors. If we increase our non-hotel accommodation business, these different market characteristics could negatively impact our profit margins; and, if these properties represent an increasing percentage of the properties added to our websites, our gross bookings growth rate and property growth rate will likely diverge over time (since each such property has fewer booking opportunities). As a result of the foregoing, as the percentage of non-hotel accommodations increases, the number of reservations per property will likely decrease.Another impact of the size of our international business is our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Because we conduct a substantial majority of our business outside the United States and report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international business are translated from local currency (principally the Euro and the British Pound Sterling) into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. For example, a strengthening of the Euro increases our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars, while a weakening of the Euro decreases our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars. Certain European Union countries with high levels of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt. Concern around devaluation or abandonment of the Euro common currency, or that sovereign default risk may be more widespread and could include the United States, has led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the Euro, the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. However, such derivative instruments are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuations that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross bookings, revenue or gross profit (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts). For example, while revenue from our international operations grew year-over-year on a local currency basis by approximately 40% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, as a result of the positive impact of currency exchange rates, revenue from our international operations as reported in U.S. Dollars grew 41.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013.The competition authorities of many governments have begun investigations into competitive practices within the online travel industry, and we may be involved or affected by such investigations and their results. For example, national competition authorities in France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Sweden and Switzerland have opened investigations that focus on Booking.com's rate parity clause in its contracts with accommodation providers in those jurisdictions. All of these investigations are at a preliminary stage. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of these investigations or how our business may be affected. Possible outcomes include requiring Booking.com to remove its rate parity clause from its contracts with accommodation providers in those jurisdictions. We note that the German competition authority has required Hotel Reservation Service to remove its rate parity clause from its contracts with hotels, though this decision is currently subject to appeal. To the extent that regulatory authorities require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry, our business, competitive position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding any such investigations could adversely affect our brand and therefore our market share and results of operations. Further, as our business grows, we may increasingly become the target of such investigations or be limited by anti-trust or competition laws. For example, our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions or our ability to expand into complementary businesses, any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete.Domestic Trends. Competition in U.S. online travel remains intense and online travel companies are creating new promotions and consumer value features in an effort to gain competitive advantages. In particular, the competition to provide ""opaque"" hotel reservation services to consumers, an area in which our priceline.com U.S. business has been a leader, has become more intense. For example, Expedia makes opaque hotel reservations available on its principal website under the name ""Expedia Unpublished Rates"" and has, we believe, supported this initiative with steeper discounts through lower margins. As with our opaque Name Your Own Price® and Express Deals® hotel reservation services, the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after booking the reservation. We believe these offerings, in particular ""Expedia Unpublished Rates,"" have adversely impacted the market share and year-over-year room night reservations growth rate for our Name Your Own Price® opaque hotel reservation service, which began to experience a decline in the third quarter of 2011. In addition, some hotels offer discounted room reservations through ""daily deal"" websites such as Groupon and Living Social. If Expedia or others are successful in growing their opaque hotel reservation services, and/or ""daily deal"" websites are successful in garnering a sizable share of discounted hotel bookings, we may have less consumer demand for our opaque hotel reservation services over time, and we would face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rates. In an effort to compete more effectively against these new offerings, in 2012 we launched Express Deals®, a semi-opaque price-disclosed hotel reservation service. While Express Deals® has been a significant contributor to the improved performance of our opaque hotel reservation service, the offering may not ultimately be successful at recovering or growing U.S. hotel reservation service market share. As a result of this increased competition, our share of the discount hotel reservation market in the United States could further decrease. 44While demand for online travel services in the United States continues to experience growth, we believe that the U.S. market share of third-party distributors is impacted in part by a concerted initiative by travel service providers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing. U.S. airlines have, at times, reduced capacity and increased fares. Decreases in capacity reduce the amount of airline tickets available, while significant increases in average airfares have adversely impacted leisure travel demand. Generally, reduced airline capacity and demand negatively impact our priceline.com air ticket reservation service, which in turn can have negative repercussions on our priceline.com hotel and rental car services. We expect continued variability in the breadth and depth of discounted airline tickets and rental car rates made available to us in the future, depending on market conditions from time to time.Seasonality. A meaningful amount of gross bookings are generated early in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. From a cost perspective, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which reservations are booked. However, we generally do not recognize associated revenue until future quarters when the travel occurs. As a result, we typically experience our highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of accommodation checkouts for the year for our North American and European businesses.In addition, the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results. For example, in 2013 our first quarter year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income, and operating margins were favorably affected by Easter falling in the first quarter instead of the second quarter in 2012. Conversely, those year-over-year growth rates were negatively impacted in our second quarter 2013.The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short-term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business. For example, in periods where our growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable advertising expense. In addition, gross profit growth is typically less impacted in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters.We experience the highest levels of booking and travel consumption for our Asia-Pacific and South American businesses in the first and fourth quarters. Therefore, if these businesses continue to grow faster than our North American and European businesses, our operating results for the first and fourth quarters of the year may become more significant over time as a percentage of full year operating results. Other Factors. We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into other international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, higher oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, volcanic eruptions (such as the April 2010 eruption of a volcano in Iceland), travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities or travel related accidents, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above.For example, in late 2012 Hurricane Sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern United States. In early 2011, Japan was struck by a major earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency. In October 2011, severe flooding in Thailand, a key market for our Agoda.com business and the Asian business of Booking.com, negatively impacted booking volumes and cancellation rates in this market. In addition, Thailand has recently experienced disruptive civil unrest, which has negatively impacted booking volumes and cancellation rates in this market. In early 2010, Thailand also experienced civil unrest, which caused the temporary relocation of Agoda.com's Thailand-based operations. Future natural disasters or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operations.We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. We have experienced pressure on operating margins as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability. 45On May 21, 2013, we acquired KAYAK Software Corporation, a leading travel meta-search service, in a stock and cash transaction. The purchase value was $2.1 billion ($1.9 billion net of cash acquired). We paid $0.5 billion in cash, from cash on hand in the United States, and $1.6 billion in shares of our common stock and assumed stock options. See Note 3 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:•Accounting for Travel Transaction Taxes. As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of travel transaction taxes (e.g. hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). In addition, over seventy-nine municipalities or counties, and at least thirteen states, have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of travel transaction taxes. Additional state and local jurisdictions are likely to assert that we are subject to travel transaction taxes and could seek to collect such taxes, retroactively and/or prospectively. Historically, we have not collected travel transaction taxes on the gross profit earned from merchant hotel transactions; however, in a handful of jurisdictions, we have been required recently by passage of a new statute or by court order, to start collecting and remitting certain taxes (local occupancy and/or sales or excise tax) imposed upon our margin and/or service fee, or in the case of Hawaii, on the full amount collected from the consumer. The ultimate resolution of these matters in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have established an accrual (including estimated interest and penalties) for potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. We accrue for legal contingencies where it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated; our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of gross profit represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. The ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. •Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient's service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance ""contingency"") which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results. Stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes charges amounting to $24.1 million, $0.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share units. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we periodically review actual and projected forfeitures. To the extent that actual or projected 46forfeiture rates differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised.•Valuation of Goodwill. We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded.A substantial portion of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of the KAYAK business in May 2013. If KAYAK is unsuccessful in profitably growing its global online travel brand or it experiences a significant reduction in advertising revenues due to factors such as a loss of continued access to travel services information provided by other OTAs and travel service providers or a reduction in advertising on its websites and mobile apps, we may incur an impairment charge related to this goodwill. The estimated fair values of our other reporting units substantially exceed their respective carrying values. Since the annual impairment test in September 2013, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment. •Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset's future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value represents the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued accounting guidance which requires entities to provide additional information about items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") to net income. Changes in AOCI balances by component, both before tax and after tax, must be disclosed and significant items reclassified out of AOCI by component must be reported either on the face of the income statement or in a separate footnote to the financial statements. The accounting guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012. See Note 14 for information on AOCI balances. There were no reclassifications out of AOCI to net income for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011. In July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting update which provides guidance on financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward exists in the same taxing jurisdiction. Per this guidance, an entity must present the unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction to a deferred tax asset, except when the carryforward is not available as of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle taxes or the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose. This amendment does not impact the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions or the disclosure reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits. The update is effective for public companies beginning after December 15, 2013. Early adoption of the update is permitted and an entity may choose to apply this amendment retrospectively to each reporting period presented. The adoption of this accounting update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 47Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2013 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked by our customers and is widely used in the travel business. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by our Booking.com, Agoda.com, and rentalcars.com businesses and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by our priceline.com business, in each case without regard to the travel destination or the location of the customer purchasing the travel.Gross bookings resulting from accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our international and U.S. operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 ChangeInternational$33,300 $23,370 42.5%Domestic5,873 5,086 15.5%Total$39,173 $28,456 37.7% Gross bookings increased by 37.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012 (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 38%), principally due to growth of 36.9% in accommodation room night reservations and growth of 37.0% in rental car day reservations. The 42.5% increase in international gross bookings (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 42%) was primarily attributable to growth in hotel and accommodation room night reservations for our Booking.com and Agoda.com businesses, as well as growth in rental car day reservations for our rentalcars.com business. Domestic gross bookings increased by 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in priceline.com's retail airline ticket service, Express Deals® hotel reservation service, and retail rental car service, partially offset by a decline in our Name Your Own Price® opaque hotel reservation service (driven in part by customer shift to Express Deals®). Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 ChangeAgency$32,672 $23,284 40.3%Merchant6,501 5,172 25.7%Total$39,173 $28,456 37.7% Agency gross bookings increased 40.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to growth in Booking.com accommodation room night reservations, as well as growth in priceline.com's retail airline ticket and rental car services. Merchant gross bookings increased 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Agoda.com accommodation room night reservations, priceline.com Express Deals® hotel room night reservations, rentalcars.com rental car day reservations and Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservations, partially offset by a decline in our Name Your Own Price® opaque hotel reservation service. 48Units sold for accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 ChangeRoom Nights270.5 197.5 36.9%Rental Car Days43.9 32.0 37.0%Airline Tickets7.0 6.4 9.1% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 36.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013, over the same period in 2012, principally due to an increase in Booking.com, Agoda.com and priceline.com Express Deals® and retail accommodation room night reservations, partially offset by a decline in our Name Your Own Price® opaque hotel room night reservations in part due to a concerted effort to emphasize Express Deals® over Name Your Own Price® in our offline advertising campaigns. Booking.com, our most significant brand, includes over 425,000 properties on its website as compared to about 275,000 properties last year (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added properties over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in these newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate and our core European market. Our priceline.com agency hotel reservations benefited from the integration of the growing number of properties on the Booking.com extranet.Rental car day reservations increased by 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013, over the same period in 2012, due to an increase in rental car day reservations for rentalcars.com and priceline.com.Airline ticket reservations increased by 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013, over the same period in 2012, due to an increase in Name Your Own Price® and price-disclosed airline ticket reservations. RevenuesWe classify our revenue into three categories: •Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the travel services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, GDS reservation booking fees related to certain travel services and customer processing fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Substantially all of the revenue for Booking.com is agency revenue comprised of travel commissions. •Merchant revenues are derived from services where we are the merchant of record and therefore charge the customer's credit card for the travel services provided. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night, rental car and airline ticket reservations and vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by travel service providers in connection with (a) the accommodation room reservations provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service at Agoda.com and priceline.com and (b) the reservations provided through our merchant rental car service at rentalcars.com and merchant Express Deals® hotel service at priceline.com, which allows customers to see the price of the reservation prior to purchase but not the identity of the travel service provider; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night, rental car and airline ticket reservations and merchant price-disclosed hotel reservations; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. •Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from KAYAK for sending referrals to travel service providers and OTAs as well as from advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile applications. 49 Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeAgency Revenues$4,410,689 $3,142,815 40.3%Merchant Revenues2,211,474 2,104,752 5.1%Advertising and Other Revenues171,143 13,389 1,178.2%Total Revenues$6,793,306 $5,260,956 29.1% Agency RevenuesAgency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 40.3% compared to the same period in 2012, primarily as a result of growth in the business of Booking.com. Our priceline.com agency revenues benefited from growth in our retail rental car business as well as the integration on the priceline.com website of the growing number of properties on the Booking.com extranet.Merchant RevenuesMerchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 5.1% compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to increases in our Agoda.com hotel reservation service, rentalcars.com rental car reservation service and priceline.com Express Deals® hotel reservation and Name Your Own Price® air services, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® opaque hotel revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Merchant revenue growth over the prior year period was substantially lower than merchant gross bookings growth because our merchant revenues are disproportionately affected by our Name Your Own Price® service. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding supplier cost recorded in cost of revenues, and represented a smaller percentage, year-over-year, of total revenues compared to our faster-growing Agoda.com, rentalcars.com and priceline.com Express Deals® services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of supplier cost. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure of evaluating growth in our business.Advertising and Other RevenuesAdvertising and other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of advertising revenues. Advertising revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes $154.5 million as a result of the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013, and excludes intercompany revenues earned by KAYAK from other Priceline Group brands. Cost of Revenues Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeCost of Revenues$1,077,420 $1,177,275 (8.5)% Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2013, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of Name Your Own Price® rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; (3) the cost of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (4) the cost of vacation packages from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (5) the cost related to accruals for travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by 8.5%, primarily due to a decrease in our Name Your Own Price® hotel reservation service, partially offset by increases in our other Name Your Own Price® services and higher accruals for travel transaction taxes. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes an accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2013 of approximately $20.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia, partially offset by a reduction in our accrual related to travel transaction taxes of $6.3 million recorded in the fourth 50quarter of 2013, principally related to a favorable agreement and ruling in the District of Columbia. Cost of revenue for the year ended December, 2012 includes an accrual of approximately $21 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and in the District of Columbia.Agency revenues have no cost of revenue. Agency revenues principally consist of travel commissions on accommodation reservations. Gross Profit Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeGross Profit$5,715,886 $4,083,681 40.0%Gross Margin84.1% 77.6% Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 40.0% compared to the same period in 2012, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by our Name Your Own Price® service. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in the year ended December 31, 2013 represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in the same period in 2012. Our retail and semi-opaque services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of supplier cost have been growing faster than our Name Your Own Price® services. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $5.02 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013, which compares to $3.56 billion for the same period in 2012. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 40% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses increased by approximately 32.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was positively impacted by the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was negatively impacted by an accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2013 of approximately $20.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia, partially offset by a credit in the fourth quarter of 2013 of $6.3 million, principally related to a favorable agreement and ruling in the District of Columbia. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 was negatively impacted by an accrual of approximately $21 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and in the District of Columbia. Operating Expenses Advertising Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeOnline Advertising$1,798,645 $1,273,637 41.2%% of Total Gross Profit31.5% 31.2% Offline Advertising$127,459 $35,492 259.1%% of Total Gross Profit2.2% 0.9% Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) banner, pop-up and other Internet advertisements; and (5) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2013, online advertising expenses increased 41.2% over the same period in 2012, primarily to generate increased gross bookings. Online advertising as a percentage of gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to (1) lower ROIs for our online advertising, (2) brand mix within The Priceline Group and (3) channel mix within certain of our brands. Our online advertising ROIs were down year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2013. Furthermore, our international brands are generally growing 51faster than our U.S. brands, and typically spend a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. Finally, certain of our brands are obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channels.The inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013 had a favorable impact on online advertising as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 because KAYAK spends a lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brands, and our consolidated results exclude intercompany advertising by our brands on KAYAK. This favorable impact will benefit year-over-year comparisons until the anniversary of the acquisition on May 21, 2014.Offline advertising expenses are related to our television, print and radio advertising for our Booking.com, priceline.com and KAYAK businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2013, offline advertising increased 259.1% compared to the same period in 2012, due mainly to Booking.com launching in the United States its first offline advertising campaign in 2013, as well as the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Booking.com also launched an offline advertising campaign in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2013. Booking.com recently launched offline advertising campaigns in Canada and the United Kingdom and may expand its offline advertising into other markets during 2014.Sales and Marketing Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeSales and Marketing$235,817 $195,934 20.4%% of Total Gross Profit4.1% 4.8% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency accommodation commission receivables; and (4) provisions for credit card chargebacks. For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2012, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as expenses related to increased content translations and the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of gross profit are typically higher for our merchant business, which incurs credit card processing fees. Our merchant business grew more slowly than our agency business, and as a result, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 declined compared to the same period in 2012. In addition, our Agoda.com business achieved a year-over-year decline in its sales and marketing expense per transaction. Personnel Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangePersonnel$698,692 $466,828 49.7%% of Total Gross Profit12.2% 11.4% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2013, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2012, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our businesses and the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $140.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $71.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Stock-based compensation expense of $30.9 million for KAYAK unvested assumed employee stock options and payroll taxes of $3.4 million for KAYAK stock option exercises were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 also includes charges amounting to $24.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for outstanding unvested performance share units. 52In July 2012 and December 2013, the Dutch Government enacted certain amendments to Dutch tax law including a one-time irrevocable levy on an employer applied to employee earnings, equal to 16% of an employee's earnings in excess of 150,000 Euros. This levy resulted in additional payroll taxes recorded in personnel expense of approximately $12 million (approximately $9 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately $14 million (approximately $10 million after tax) principally recorded in the third quarter of 2012.General and Administrative Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$252,994 $173,171 46.1%% of Total Gross Profit4.4% 4.2% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 over the same period in 2012, primarily due to higher recruiting, training and travel expenses related to increased headcount in all our businesses, higher occupancy and office expenses related to the expansion of our international businesses, and the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 included approximately $8.5 million of professional fees related to the acquisition of KAYAK. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes approximately $3 million of professional fees related to the acquisition of KAYAK and a charge of approximately $3 million related to certain leased space that was vacated in connection with the relocation of Booking.com's headquarters to a new location in Amsterdam. Information Technology Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeInformation Technology$71,890 $43,685 64.6%% of Total Gross Profit1.3% 1.1% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) outsourced data center costs; (2) system maintenance and software license fees; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2012 was due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations and the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Depreciation and Amortization Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$117,975 $65,141 81.1%% of Total Gross Profit2.1% 1.6% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) depreciation of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2013, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2012 due primarily to intangible amortization from the KAYAK acquisition for $33.4 million, and increased depreciation expense due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com brand. 53Other Income (Expense) Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeInterest Income$4,167 $3,860 8.0%Interest Expense(83,289) (62,064) 34.2%Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(36,755) (9,720) 278.1%Total$(115,877) $(67,924) 70.6% For the year ended December 31, 2013, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance partially offset by lower yields. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt resulting from the May 2013 issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes and the March 2012 issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange gains of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with foreign exchange gains of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, resulted in losses of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to foreign exchange transaction losses of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company delivered cash of $414.6 million to repay the aggregate principal amount and issued 972,235 shares of its common stock in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount associated with the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2015 that were converted prior to maturity. The conversion of our convertible debt prior to maturity resulted in a non-cash loss of $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, and is recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Income Taxes Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$403,739 $337,832 19.5% Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 17.6% and 19.2%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to lower tax rates outside the United States, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. Our effective tax rates were lower for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, due to growth in our international businesses. According to Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying ""innovative"" activities is taxed at a rate of 5% (""Innovation Box Tax"") rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. Booking.com obtained a ruling from the Dutch tax authorities in February 2011 confirming that a portion of its earnings is eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment. The ruling from the Dutch tax authorities is valid through December 31, 2017. Until our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire, most of our U.S. income will not be subject to a cash tax liability, other than federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes. However, we expect to pay foreign taxes on our non-U.S. income other than in countries where we have operating loss carryforwards. We expect that our international operations will grow their pretax income at higher rates than the U.S. business over the long term and, therefore, it is our 54expectation that our cash tax payments will increase as our international businesses generate an increasing share of our pre-tax income. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2013 2012 ChangeNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests$135 $4,471 (97.0)% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest is lower for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, mainly due to a reduction in redeemable noncontrolling interests. We purchased the remaining outstanding shares underlying the redeemable noncontrolling interests in April 2013.Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2012 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Operating and Statistical Metrics Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our international and domestic operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 ChangeInternational$23,370 $16,909 38.2%Domestic5,086 4,748 7.1%Total$28,456 $21,658 31.4% Gross bookings increased by 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011 (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 37%), principally due to 39.5% growth in hotel room night reservations, partly offset by foreign currency impact and slower growth rates for our non-hotel businesses. The 38.2% increase in international gross bookings for the year ended December 31, 2012 (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 46%) was primarily attributable to growth in hotel room night reservations for our Booking.com and Agoda.com businesses, as well as growth in rental car reservations for our rentalcars.com business. Domestic gross bookings increased by 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to an increase in price-disclosed airline ticket reservations and associated higher airfares, as well as an increase in price-disclosed hotel room night reservations and associated higher average daily rates (""ADRs""). Retail rental car day reservations for our priceline.com business also increased in the year ended December 31, 2012. Our Name Your Own Price® hotel, air, and rental car businesses experienced a decline in reservations in the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 ChangeAgency$23,284 $17,610 32.2%Merchant5,172 4,048 27.8%Total$28,456 $21,658 31.4% 55Agency gross bookings increased 32.2% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due primarily to growth in Booking.com hotel room night reservations. Our U.S. priceline.com business also experienced growth in reservations of agency price-disclosed hotel room nights, airline tickets, and rental car days. Merchant gross bookings increased 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to an increase in Agoda.com hotel room night reservations and rentalcars.com rental car day reservations. Higher ADRs drove growth in merchant gross bookings related to our priceline.com price-disclosed hotel business, while our Name Your Own Price® hotel business experienced a decline in hotel room night reservations for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, due to competitive pressures. Gross bookings related to Name Your Own Price® rental car reservations and airline ticket reservations also experienced a decline for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Units sold for hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 ChangeHotel Room Nights197.5 141.6 39.5%Rental Car Days32.0 23.8 34.9%Airline Tickets6.4 6.2 2.7%Hotel room night reservations increased by 39.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, principally due to an increase in Booking.com, Agoda.com and priceline.com price-disclosed hotel room night reservations, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations as a result of increased domestic competition in the opaque hotel room reservation market, including from Expedia's ""Expedia Unpublished Rates"" service. Booking.com, our most significant brand, includes over 275,000 properties on its website as of February 25, 2013 (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com added properties in 2012 in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in these newer markets, which are growing faster than our overall growth rate and our core European market. Our U.S. priceline.com agency hotel reservations benefited from the integration of properties from the Booking.com extranet on the priceline.com website.Rental car day reservations increased by 34.9% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due primarily to an increase in rental car day reservations for our rentalcars.com business and priceline.com price-disclosed business, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® rental car day reservations due to limited availability of discounted supply as well as lower retail pricing. Airline ticket reservations increased by 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to an increase in price-disclosed airline ticket reservations partially offset by a decrease in Name Your Own Price® ticket reservations for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to limited availability of discounted supply. Revenues Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 Change Agency Revenues$3,142,815 $2,339,253 34.4%Merchant Revenues2,104,752 2,004,432 5.0%Advertising and Other Revenues13,389 11,925 12.3%Total Revenues$5,260,956 $4,355,610 20.8% 56Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 34.4% compared to the same period in 2011, primarily as a result of growth in the business of Booking.com. Our U.S. agency revenues benefited from the integration of properties from the Booking.com extranet on the priceline.com website as well as growth in our priceline.com retail rental car business.Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 5.0% compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to increases in our Agoda.com hotel reservation business, rentalcars.com rental car business and priceline.com merchant price-disclosed hotel reservation business, partially offset by a decline in our Name Your Own Price® businesses. Merchant revenue growth over the prior year period was substantially lower than merchant gross bookings growth because our merchant revenues are disproportionately affected by our Name Your Own Price® business. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and represented a smaller percentage, year-over-year, of total revenues compared to our faster-growing Agoda.com and rentalcars.com businesses, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of provider cost. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Advertising and Other Revenues Advertising and other revenues consisted primarily of advertising revenues. Advertising and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased compared to the same period in 2011.Cost of Revenues Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeCost of Revenues$1,177,275 $1,275,730 (7.7)% Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2012, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of Name Your Own Price® rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (3) the cost of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 7.7%, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to a decrease in our Name Your Own Price® businesses. Merchant price-disclosed hotel room and rental car reservations are recorded in merchant revenues net of the amounts paid to travel service providers, and therefore, there is no associated cost of revenues for merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of merchant revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, a trend we expect to continue, primarily due to the increase in Agoda.com and rentalcars.com revenues, all of which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of provider cost. Cost of revenues also includes approximately $21 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for an accrual recorded for the year ended December 31, 2012 related to travel transaction taxes in the State of Hawaii and in the District of Columbia. Gross Profit Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeGross Profit$4,083,681 $3,079,880 32.6%Gross Margin77.6% 70.7% 57Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 32.6% compared to the same period in 2011, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by our Name Your Own Price® business. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in 2012 represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in 2011. Our retail price-disclosed businesses, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of provider cost, grew faster than our Name Your Own Price® businesses. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $3.6 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012, which compares to $2.6 billion for the same period in 2011. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 48% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Gross profit attributable to our priceline.com U.S. business increased by approximately 2% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Gross profit for our priceline.com U.S. business was negatively impacted by an accrual of approximately $21 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded for the year ended December 31, 2012 related to legal rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia pertaining to travel transaction taxes. Operating Expenses Advertising Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeOnline Advertising$1,273,637 $919,214 38.6%% of Total Gross Profit31.2% 29.8% Offline Advertising$35,492 $35,470 0.1%% of Total Gross Profit0.9% 1.2% Online advertising expenses primarily consisted of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (5) email campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2012, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2011, primarily to support increased hotel room night reservations for Booking.com and Agoda.com, increased rental car day reservations for rentalcars.com and increased travel reservations for priceline.com. Online advertising as a percentage of gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase is driven by (1) brand mix within the Priceline Group, (2) the channel mix within our brands and (3) recently lower returns on investment (""ROIs"") from our online advertising. Our international brands grew faster than our priceline.com U.S. brand, and spent a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. Furthermore, our brands generally obtained an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channels. Finally, our online advertising ROIs were down year-over-year.Offline advertising expenses are related to our television, print and radio advertising for our priceline.com U.S. business. For the year ended December 31, 2012, offline advertising was flat compared to the same period in 2011. Sales and Marketing Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeSales and Marketing$195,934 $162,690 20.4%% of Total Gross Profit4.8% 5.3% Sales and marketing expenses consisted primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2012, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2011, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as expenses related to increased content 58translations. The increase was partially offset by reduced credit card processing fees resulting from the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform and Consumer Protection Act (which amendment caps the interchange fee for debit card transactions and went into effect on October 1, 2011). Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of gross profit are typically higher for our merchant business which incurs credit card processing fees. Our merchant business grew more slowly than our agency business, and as a result, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross profit for year ended December 31, 2012, declined compared to the same period in 2011. Personnel Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangePersonnel$466,828 $352,295 32.5%% of Total Gross Profit11.4% 11.4% Personnel expenses consisted of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2012, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2011, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our international businesses and the one-time wage tax levy of approximately $14 million described below. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $71.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included charges amounting to $0.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for certain outstanding unvested performance share units. In July 2012, the Dutch Government enacted certain amendments to Dutch tax law including, among other things, a one-time irrevocable levy on an employer equal to 16% of an employee's 2012 earnings in excess of 150,000 Euros. The levy was remitted to the tax authorities in 2013. This levy resulted in additional payroll taxes recorded in personnel expense of approximately $14 million (approximately $10 million after tax). Of the total additional payroll taxes, approximately $13 million were recorded in the third quarter of 2012.General and Administrative Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$173,171 $123,652 40.0%% of Total Gross Profit4.2% 4.0% General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of: (1) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses; (2) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; and (3) occupancy expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 over the same period in 2011, primarily due to expansion of our office capacity worldwide to support continued growth in our international operations. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes approximately $3 million of professional fees related to the acquisition of KAYAK and a charge of approximately $3 million related to certain leased space that was vacated in connection with the relocation of Booking.com's headquarters to a new location in Amsterdam. Additionally, we have had higher recruiting, training and travel expenses related to increased headcount in all of our businesses. 59Information Technology Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeInformation Technology$43,685 $33,813 29.2%% of Total Gross Profit1.1% 1.1% Information technology expenses consisted primarily of: (1) outsourced data center costs relating to our U.S. and international data centers; (2) system maintenance and software license fees; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2011 was due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations.Depreciation and Amortization Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$65,141 $53,824 21.0%% of Total Gross Profit1.6% 1.7% Depreciation and amortization expenses consisted of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) amortization of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2012, depreciation expense increased from the same period in 2011 due principally to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com brand. Other Income (Expense) Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeInterest Income$3,860 $8,119 (52.5)%Interest Expense(62,064) (31,721) 95.7 %Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(9,720) (7,526) 29.2 %Total$(67,924) $(31,128) 118.2 % For the year ended December 31, 2012, interest income on cash and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2011, primarily due to lower yields partially offset by an increase in the average balance invested. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt resulting from the March 2012 issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, and fees on the undrawn $1.0 billion revolving credit facility entered into in October 2011. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange gains of $0.7 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and were recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, resulted in losses of $10.5 million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and were recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we began classifying certain foreign currency processing fees as an offset to revenue earned from the third party that processes the 60payments for merchant hotel transactions. Such processing fees recorded to ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 amounted to approximately $5.0 million. Income Taxes Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$337,832 $308,663 9.5% Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 19.2% and 22.6%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the Innovation Box Tax benefit in 2012. Our effective tax rate differed from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to lower foreign tax rates, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. The Internal Revenue Service initiated an audit of our 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns for the first time in the third quarter of 2011. The audit was concluded in June 2012 with no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the audit). Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year EndedDecember 31, ($000) 2012 2011 ChangeNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests4,471 2,760 62.0% The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011 increased due mainly to improved year-over-year operating performance for the rentalcars.com business, partially offset by a reduction in redeemable noncontrolling interests from 19.0% in April 2011 to 12.7% in April 2012. 61Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2013, we had $6.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Approximately $4.9 billion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held by our international subsidiaries and are denominated primarily in Euros and, to a lesser extent, in British Pound Sterling and other currencies. We currently intend to permanently reinvest this cash in our international operations. If we repatriate this cash to the United States, we would utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and beyond that amount incur additional tax payments in the United States. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of foreign and U.S. government securities and bank deposits. In May 2013, we issued in a private placement $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2020, with an interest rate of 0.35%. We used approximately $144.6 million of the net proceeds to repurchase outstanding common stock in privately negotiated, off-market transactions concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes. Interest on the notes is payable in June and December of each year. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these notes. In March 2012, we issued in a private placement $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2018, with an interest rate of 1.0%. We used approximately $166.2 million of the net proceeds to repurchase outstanding common stock in privately negotiated, off-market transactions concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes. Interest on the notes is payable in March and September of each year. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these notes. In October 2011, we entered into a $1.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50%; or (ii) the greatest of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association's prime lending rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) an adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $50 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2013, there were no borrowings under the facility, and approximately $2.2 million of letters of credit were issued under the facility. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company purchased 916,271 shares of its common stock for a total value of $804.7 million, which includes the purchase of 182,538 shares made concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes in May 2013 in privately negotiated, off-market transactions. As of December 31, 2013, we have a remaining aggregate amount of $654.5 million authorized by our Board of Directors to purchase our common stock. We may from time to time make additional repurchases of our common stock, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, and other factors.In April 2013, we purchased the remaining outstanding shares underlying redeemable noncontrolling interests in TravelJigsaw Holdings Limited for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $192.5 million. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.On May 21, 2013, we acquired KAYAK Software Corporation, a leading travel meta-search service, in a stock and cash transaction. The purchase value was $2.1 billion ($1.9 billion net of cash acquired). We paid $0.5 billion in cash, from cash on hand in the United States, and $1.6 billion in shares of our common stock and assumed stock options. See Note 3 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the acquisition. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company delivered cash of $414.6 million to repay the aggregate principal amount and issued 972,235 shares of its common stock in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount associated with the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2015 that were converted prior to maturity. As of February 11, 2014, the Company had received conversion notices that will be settled in the first quarter of 2014 for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $58 million associated with the 2015 Notes, and, as a result, during the first quarter of 2014, the Company will deliver cash of approximately $58 million to satisfy the aggregate principal amount for these conversion notices. 62Our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in deferred merchant bookings and supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our merchant transactions during the last few weeks of every quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013, was $2.3 billion, resulting from net income of $1.9 billion, a favorable impact of non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $355.7 million and net favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $52.9 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2013, were primarily related to a $182.2 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $111.6 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount, a non-cash loss on convertible notes converted prior to maturity, and deferred income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012, was $1.8 billion, resulting from net income of $1.4 billion, a favorable impact of non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $217.9 million and net favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $143.8 million.

The increase in these working capital balances were primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of debt discount.

Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 were affected by net purchases of investments of $1.7 billion, payments of $331.9 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, a change in restricted cash of $2.8 million, and net cash payments of $78.6 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 were affected by net purchases of investments of $1.6 billion, payments of $33.9 million for acquisitions, and a change in restricted cash of $2.8 million, partially offset by net cash proceeds of $82.1 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts. Cash invested in purchase of property and equipment was $84.4 million and $55.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in 2013 was related to additional data center capacity and new offices to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com brand. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $403.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily related to payments for treasury stock purchases of $883.5 million, $192.5 million spent to purchase the remaining shares underlying noncontrolling interests in rentalcars.com, $414.6 million to satisfy the aggregate principal amount due upon the early conversion of senior notes, and $1.0 million of debt issuance costs, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, $91.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, and $17.7 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $668.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, $2.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, and $5.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation partially offset by treasury stock purchases of $257.0 million, $61.1 million spent to purchase a portion of the shares underlying noncontrolling interests in rentalcars.com, and $20.9 million of debt issuance costs. ContingenciesA number of jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against online travel companies, including us, related to, among other things, the payment of travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). In addition, a number of U.S. states, counties and municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of travel transaction taxes. To date, the majority of taxing jurisdictions in which we facilitate the making of travel reservations have not asserted that taxes are due and payable on our travel services. With respect to jurisdictions that have not initiated proceedings to date, it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statutes and seek to collect taxes from us only on a prospective basis. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these pending cases and proceedings, and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Adverse application of state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations"" in this Annual Report. 63As a result of this litigation and other attempts by jurisdictions to levy similar taxes, we have established an accrual for the probable cost of resolving issues related to travel transaction taxes in the amount of approximately $55 million at December 31, 2013 and approximately $56 million at December 31, 2012 (which includes, among other things, amounts related to the litigation in the State of Hawaii, District of Columbia, San Antonio and Chicago). Our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued. The actual cost may be less or greater, potentially significantly, than the liabilities recorded. An estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued cannot be reasonably made. We believe that even if we were to suffer adverse determinations in the near term in more of the pending proceedings than currently anticipated given results to date, because of our available cash, it would not have a material impact on our liquidity.The following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2013 (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands)Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations $320,026 $49,691 $92,369 $68,431 $109,535Convertible debt(1) 2,228,216 177,065 27,000 1,019,056 1,005,095Revolving credit facility(2) 5,477 2,235 3,242 — —Total(3) $2,553,719 $228,991 $122,611 $1,087,487 $1,114,630_____________________________(1)Convertible debt represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and interest of $68 million. Convertible debt does not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or shares of common stock at our option. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Represents fees on uncommitted funds and outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2013.(3)We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $76 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013, of which approximately $55 million related to our accrual for potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes (refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and approximately $15 million related to unrecognized tax benefits (refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for these liabilities. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as ""non-current"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have excluded ""Other long-term liabilities"" in the amount of $76 million from the contractual obligations table because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. Since the contingent conversion threshold for the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 was exceeded as of December 31, 2013, these notes are convertible at the option of the holders. If the holders elect to convert, we will be required to pay the aggregate principal amount in cash and we will deliver cash or shares of common stock, at our option, for the conversion value in excess of the aggregate principal amount. We would likely fund our conversion obligations with cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2013, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 64Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2013. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2013, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future.Fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our available for sale investments assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments as of December 31, 2013 of approximately $16 million. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity.As of December 31, 2013, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt is $2.2 billion. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2013. A substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount is related to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible bonds.We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euros). As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the operating results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency results in gains and losses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. Our derivative contracts principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the Euro and the British Pound Sterling versus the U.S. Dollar. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no such outstanding derivative contracts. Foreign exchange gains of $0.3 million, $0.7 million, and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, were recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had outstanding forward currency contracts with a notional value of 3.0 billion Euros and 1.5 billion Euros, respectively, that are designated as hedges of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary for accounting purposes. These contracts are all short-term in nature. Mark-to-market adjustments on these net investment hedges are recorded as currency translation adjustments. The fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2013 was a liability of $121.3 million, with $121.5 million recorded in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" and $0.2 million recorded in ""Prepaid and other current assets"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2012 was a liability of $62.4 million, with $62.6 million recorded in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" and $0.2 65million recorded in ""Prepaid expenses and other current assets"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a derivative liability of approximately $530.7 million as of December 31, 2013.

1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2015,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include those discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Overview We are a leading provider of online travel and travel related reservation and search services. Through our online travel agent (""OTA"") services, we connect consumers wishing to make travel reservations with providers of travel services around the world. We offer consumers accommodation reservations (including hotels, bed and breakfasts, hostels, apartments, vacation rentals and other properties) through our Booking.com, priceline.com and agoda.com brands. Our priceline.com brand also offers consumers reservations for rental cars, airline tickets, vacation packages and cruises. We offer rental car reservations worldwide through rentalcars.com. We also allow consumers to easily compare airline ticket, hotel reservation and rental car reservation information from hundreds of travel websites at once through KAYAK. We recently acquired OpenTable, a leading provider of online restaurant reservations. We believe that the online restaurant reservation business is complementary to our online travel businesses, and that both OpenTable and our travel businesses will benefit from adding OpenTable to The Priceline Group. We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands, including Booking.com, priceline.com, KAYAK, agoda.com, rentalcars.com and, as of July 24, 2014, OpenTable, collectively as ""The Priceline Group,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us.""We launched our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to include Booking.com, KAYAK, agoda.com, rentalcars.com and OpenTable, which are independently managed and operated brands. Our principal goal is to serve consumers and our travel service provider and restaurant partners with worldwide leadership in online reservation services. Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda.com and rentalcars.com and the results of the internationally based websites of KAYAK and, as of July 24, 2014, OpenTable (in each case regardless of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while making a reservation or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant). During the year ended December 31, 2014, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 87% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers), and approximately 94% of our consolidated operating income. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information. A significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. We derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following sources:•Commissions earned from facilitating reservations of accommodations, rental cars, cruises and other travel services;•Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our accommodation, rental car, airline ticket and vacation package reservation services;•Advertising revenues primarily earned by KAYAK from sending referrals to OTAs and travel service providers, as well as from advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps;•Beginning on July 24, 2014, revenues recognized by OpenTable, which consist of reservation revenues (a fee for restaurant guests seated through OpenTable's online reservation service), subscription fees for restaurant reservation management services and other revenues; and•Global distribution system (""GDS"") reservation booking fees related to our Name Your Own Price® hotel, rental car and airline ticket reservation services, and price-disclosed airline ticket and rental car reservation services.Our priceline.com brand offers merchant Name Your Own Price® opaque travel services, which are recorded in revenue on a ""gross"" basis and have associated cost of revenue. All of our other services are recorded in revenue on a ""net"" basis and have no associated cost of revenue. Therefore, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of our revenues between Name Your Own Price® travel services and other services. Gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for our retail, Name Your Own Price® and semi-opaque travel services and our advertising and other services. Consequently, gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business because, in contrast to our revenues, it is not affected by 40the different methods of recording revenue and cost of revenue between our Name Your Own Price® travel services and our other services. TrendsOver the last several years we have experienced strong growth in our accommodation reservation services. We believe this growth is the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the widespread adoption of mobile devices, the high growth of travel overall in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and South America, and the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to build accommodation supply, content and distribution and to improve the customer experience on our websites and mobile apps. These year-over-year growth rates have generally decelerated in recent years. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2014, our accommodation room night reservation growth was 28%, a deceleration from 37% in 2013, 40% in 2012 and 53% in 2011. Given the size of our hotel reservation business, we expect that our year-over-year growth rates will continue to decelerate, though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate.The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet use and e-commerce activity of international consumers have trailed that of consumers in the United States. However, international consumers are rapidly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. We expect that over the long-term, international online travel growth rates will follow a similar trend to that experienced in the United States. In addition, the base of hotel properties in Europe and Asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. Our growth has primarily been generated by our international accommodation reservation service brands, Booking.com and agoda.com. Booking.com, our most significant brand, included over 600,000 properties on its website as of February 13, 2015, which included over 245,000 vacation rental properties (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added properties over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from both a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in our newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate. We believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the markets in which we operate. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the leading online accommodation reservation service provider in the world as measured by room nights booked.As our international business represents the substantial majority of our financial results, we expect to continue to see our operating results and other financial metrics largely driven by international performance. For example, certain markets in which we operate that are in earlier stages of development have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets, which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as these markets increase in size over time. Also, we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodations available for reservation on our websites, including hotels, bed and breakfasts, hostels and vacation rentals. Vacation rentals generally consist of, among others, properties categorized as single-unit and multi-unit villas, apartments, ""aparthotels"" (which are apartments with a front desk and cleaning service) and chalets and are generally self-catered (i.e., include a kitchen), directly bookable properties. Many of the newer accommodations we add to our travel reservation services, especially in highly penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms, lower average daily rates (""ADRs"") or higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of consumers (e.g., hostels and bed and breakfasts), and therefore may also negatively impact our margins. For example, because a vacation rental is either a single unit or a small collection of independent units, vacation rental properties represent more limited booking opportunities than non-vacation rental properties, which generally have more units to rent per property. Our non-hotel accommodations in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism seasons, weather or other factors. As we increase our non-hotel accommodation business, these different market characteristics could negatively impact our profit margins; and, to the extent these properties represent an increasing percentage of the properties added to our websites, our gross bookings growth rate and property growth rate will likely diverge over time (since each such property has fewer booking opportunities). As a result of the foregoing, as the percentage of non-hotel accommodations increases, the number of reservations per property will likely decrease. In addition, non-hotel accommodations, including vacation rentals, tend to be more seasonal in nature and may close during ""off-season,"" which impacts our property counts quarter to quarter.Concerns persist about the outlook for the global economy in general, and the European Union in particular, with recent declines in broad Eurozone economic indicators raising fears about the pace of economic growth and the risk of deflation. In addition, many governments around the world, including the U.S. government and certain European governments, continue to operate at large financial deficits, resulting in high levels of sovereign debt in such countries. Greece, Ireland, Portugal and certain other European Union countries with high levels of sovereign debt at times have had difficulty refinancing 41their debt. Failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solutions to these issues has resulted in a high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook. This uncertainty, as well as concern over governmental austerity measures including higher taxes and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. At times, we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates and weaker trends in hotel ADRs across many regions of the world, particularly in those European countries that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainties. We believe that these business trends are likely impacted by weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. Disruptions in the economies of such countries could cause, contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro-economic conditions.Greece's newly elected government, which campaigned against austerity measures, may not be able to reach an acceptable solution to the country's debt crisis with the European Union. This may increase the likelihood that Greece, and in turn other countries, could exit the European Union, which could lead to added economic uncertainty and further devaluation or eventual abandonment of the Euro common currency. These and other macro-economic uncertainties, such as sovereign default risk becoming more widespread, declining oil prices and geopolitical tensions, have led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the Euro, the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. The European Central Bank, in an effort to stimulate the European economy, recently launched a quantitative easing program to purchase public debt, which in turn has caused the Euro exchange rate to weaken compared to the U.S. Dollar. Our international business represents a substantial majority of our financial results. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 87% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers), and approximately 94% of our consolidated operating income. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international businesses are translated from local currency (principally the Euro and the British Pound Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. The U.S. Dollar significantly strengthened against the Euro during 2014, moving from an exchange rate of 1.38 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 1, 2014 to 1.13 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 31, 2015. The U.S. Dollar also strengthened significantly during this time frame as compared to many other currencies. As a result, our foreign currency denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses and net income have been negatively impacted as expressed in U.S. Dollars. For example, gross profit from our international operations grew year-over-year on a local currency basis by approximately 32% for the three months ended December 31, 2014, but, as a result of the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, grew 24% as reported in U.S. Dollars. The U.S. Dollar significantly strengthened against the Euro during 2014, moving from an exchange rate of 1.38 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 1, 2014 to 1.21 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of December 31, 2014. The U.S. Dollar strengthened further in January 2015 to an exchange rate of 1.13 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 31, 2015. The U.S. Dollar has also strengthened against many other currencies since January 1, 2014. At these exchange rates, the growth of our total and international gross bookings, expressed in U.S. Dollars, will be significantly adversely impacted in 2015. We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. However, such derivative instruments are short-term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuations that could impact our gross bookings, revenues or gross profit (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts).Significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates can also impact consumer travel behavior. For example, recent dramatic depreciation of the Russian Ruble has resulted in it becoming more expensive for Russians to travel to Europe and most other non-Ruble destinations. Consumers traveling from a country whose currency has weakened against other currencies may book lower ADR accommodations, choose to shorten or cancel their international travel plans or choose to travel domestically rather than internationally, any of which could adversely affect our gross bookings, revenues and results of operations, in particular when expressed in U.S. Dollars.The uncertainty of macro-economic factors, the volatility in foreign exchange rates and their impact on consumer behavior, which may differ across regions, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our results of operations.We compete with both online and traditional travel and travel related reservation and search services. The market for the travel reservation and search services we offer is intensely competitive, a trend we expect to continue, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. We currently, or potentially may in the future, compete with a variety of companies, including:•online travel reservation services such as those owned by Expedia, Orbitz (which has agreed to be acquired by Expedia), Ctrip, Rakuten, eDreams ODIGEO and Jalan; 42•online accommodation search and/or reservation services, such as HomeAway and Airbnb, focused on vacation rental properties, including individually owned properties;•large online companies, including search, social networking and marketplace companies such as Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Amazon and Groupon;•traditional travel agencies, wholesalers and tour operators, such as Carlson Wagonlit, American Express, Thomas Cook and Tui Travel, as well as thousands of individual travel agencies around the world;•travel service providers such as accommodation providers, rental car companies and airlines;•online travel search and price comparison services (generally referred to as ""meta-search"" services), such as TripAdvisor, trivago (in which Expedia has acquired a majority ownership interest), Qunar and HotelsCombined; and•online restaurant reservation services, such as TripAdvisor's LaFourchette and Yelp's SeatMe.For more detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face, see Part I Item 1 Business - ""Competition"" and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance."" and ""Recent trends in consumer adoption and use of mobile devices create new challenges and may enable device companies such as Apple to compete directly with us.""After entering into an exclusive, long-term strategic marketing agreement in August 2013, Expedia acquired Travelocity in January 2015. On February 12, 2015, Expedia announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Orbitz. To the extent these acquisitions enhance Expedia's ability to compete with us, in particular in the United States, which is Expedia's, Travelocity's and Orbitz's largest market, our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected.Widespread adoption of mobile devices, such as the iPhone, Android-enabled smart phones and tablets such as the iPad, coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousands of useful ""apps"" available on these devices, is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platforms. We have experienced a significant shift of business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Our major competitors and certain new market entrants are offering mobile applications for travel products and other mobile functionality, including proprietary last-minute discounts for accommodation reservations. Advertising and distribution opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes. The gross profit earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance. Further, given the device sizes and technical limitations of tablets and smart phones, mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing a similar service and instead prefer to use one or a limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity. As a result, the consumer experience with mobile apps as well as brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important. Our mobile offerings have received strong reviews and achieved solid download trends, and are driving a material and increasing share of our business. We believe that mobile bookings present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices instead of a personal computer and to mobile applications in addition to a web browser. If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if our mobile apps are not downloaded and used by consumers, we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we have observed an increase in promotional pricing to closed user groups (such as loyalty program participants or customers with registered accounts), including through mobile apps. If we are not as effective as our competition in offering discounted prices to closed user groups or if we are unable to entice members of our competitors' closed user groups to use our services, our ability to grow and compete could be harmed. Further, growth in discounted closed user group retail prices for hotel rooms lessens the price difference for members of closed user groups between a retail hotel reservation and an opaque hotel reservation, which may lead to fewer consumers using our opaque hotel reservation services. If we need to fund discounts out of our gross profit, our profitability could be adversely affected.We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through aggressive marketing and promotional campaigns. As a result, both our online and offline advertising expense has increased significantly in recent years, a trend we expect to continue. During 2014, our total online advertising expense was approximately $2.4 billion, a substantial portion of 43which was spent internationally through Internet search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services and affiliate marketing. We also invested $231 million in offline advertising. We intend to continue a strategy of aggressively promoting brand awareness, primarily through online means although we also intend to increase our offline advertising efforts, including by expanding offline campaigns into additional markets. For example, building on its first offline advertising campaign, which it launched in the United States in 2013, Booking.com has begun offline advertising campaigns in other markets, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany. We have observed increased offline advertising by OTAs, meta-search services and travel service providers, particularly in North America and Europe, which may make our offline advertising efforts more expensive and less effective.Online advertising efficiency, expressed as online advertising as a percentage of gross profit, is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are, in some cases, outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers and the extent to which consumers come directly to our websites or mobile apps for bookings. For example, competition for desired rankings in search results and/or a decline in ad clicks by consumers, could increase our costs-per-click and reduce our online advertising efficiency. From 2011 to 2013 our online advertising grew faster than our gross profit due to (1) year-over-year declines in online advertising returns on investment (""ROIs"") and (2) brand mix within The Priceline Group as our international brands grew faster than our U.S. brands and spent a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. In 2014, these long-term trends were more than offset by the inclusion of KAYAK and OpenTable because they spend a lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brands. Also, our consolidated results exclude intercompany advertising by our brands on KAYAK since our acquisition of KAYAK in May 2013. If Google changes how it presents travel search results or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results in a manner that is competitively disadvantageous to us, whether to support its own travel related services or otherwise, our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites could be harmed. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We rely on online advertising channels to enhance our brand awareness and to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites."" and ""Our business could be negatively affected by changes in Internet search engine algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.""The competition authorities of many governments have begun investigations into competitive practices within the online travel industry, and we may be involved or affected by such investigations and their results. For example, Booking.com has been the subject of a competition investigation by U.K. competition authorities since July 2012. Other national competition authorities, including those in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Sweden and Switzerland, have more recently opened investigations that focus on Booking.com's rate parity clause in its contracts with accommodation providers in those jurisdictions. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of all of these investigations or how our business may be affected. Possible outcomes include requiring Booking.com to remove its rate parity clause from its contracts with accommodation providers in those jurisdictions. In the U.K. investigation, Booking.com and the other subjects of the investigation had reached a settlement with the competition authorities; however, that settlement has been vacated on appeal. On December 15, 2014, the French, Italian and Swedish national competition authorities, working in close cooperation with the European Commission, announced their intention to seek public feedback on commitments offered by Booking.com in connection with investigations of Booking.com's rate parity provisions in its contractual arrangements with accommodation providers. See Footnote 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""As the size of our business grows, we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti-trust and competition regulators."" We note that the German competition authority has required Hotel Reservation Service, a leading OTA in Germany, to remove its rate parity clause from its contracts with hotels, and Hotel Reservation Service's initial appeal was denied. To the extent that regulatory authorities require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry, our business, competitive position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding any such investigations could adversely affect our brand and therefore our market share and results of operations.Hotels typically make available only a limited number of hotel rooms for opaque services like ours, especially during periods of high occupancy. As a result, recent high hotel occupancy levels in the United States have had an adverse impact on our access to hotel rooms for our opaque hotel reservation services, which has negatively affected our opaque hotel reservation gross profits.SeasonalityA meaningful amount of gross bookings are generated early in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. From a cost perspective, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as the expense is incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which reservations are booked. However, we generally do not recognize associated revenue until future quarters when the travel occurs. As a result, we typically experience our highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of accommodation checkouts for the year for our European and North American businesses. 44In addition, the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results. For example, in 2013 our second quarter year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were adversely affected by Easter falling in the first quarter instead of the second quarter, as it did in 2012. Conversely, our second quarter 2014 year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were favorably impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, as it did in 2013.The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short-term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business. For example, in periods where our growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable advertising expense. In addition, gross profit growth is typically less impacted in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters.We experience the highest levels of booking and travel consumption for our Asia-Pacific and South American businesses in the first and fourth quarters. Therefore, if these businesses grow faster than our North American and European businesses, our operating results for the first and fourth quarters of the year may become more significant over time as a percentage of full year operating results. Other FactorsWe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel and travel related services and further expand into other international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions, travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities or travel related accidents, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above.For example, in late 2012 Hurricane Sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern United States. In early 2011, Japan was struck by a major earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency. In October 2011, severe flooding in Thailand, a key market for our agoda.com business and the Asian business of Booking.com, negatively impacted booking volumes and cancellation rates in this market. In addition, Thailand has recently experienced disruptive civil unrest, which has negatively impacted booking volumes and cancellation rates in this market. In early 2010, Thailand also experienced civil unrest, which caused the temporary relocation of agoda.com's Thailand-based operations. Future natural disasters, health concerns or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operations.We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. We have experienced pressure on operating margins as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability.On July 24, 2014, we acquired OpenTable, a leading provider of online restaurant reservations, for $2.5 billion ($2.4 billion net of cash acquired) and on May 21, 2013, we acquired KAYAK Software Corporation, a leading travel meta-search service, for $2.1 billion ($1.9 billion net of cash acquired). A substantial portion of the total consideration for these acquisitions related to identifiable acquired intangibles and goodwill (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2015, we intend to invest in OpenTable to accelerate its global expansion, increase the value offered to its restaurant partners and enhance the end-to-end experience for customers across desktop and mobile devices. As a result, we expect OpenTable's profitability in 2015 to decline year-over-year as we invest for future growth. If the investments we intend to make in 2015 and beyond, in particular internationally, are unsuccessful in growing OpenTable's global online restaurant reservation business or OpenTable experiences a significant reduction in revenues or profitability due to factors such as competition, increased capital expenditures or investments in its business, we may incur an impairment. Likewise, if KAYAK is unsuccessful in profitably growing its global online travel brand or it experiences a significant reduction in advertising revenues on its websites or mobile apps or profitability due to factors such as a loss of continued access to travel services information provided by other OTAs or travel service providers, we may incur an impairment. 45Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:•Accounting for Travel Transaction Taxes. As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of travel transaction taxes (e.g. hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). In addition, over seventy-nine municipalities or counties, and at least eleven states, have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of travel transaction taxes. Additional state and local jurisdictions are likely to assert that we are subject to travel transaction taxes and could seek to collect such taxes, retroactively and/or prospectively. Historically, we have not collected travel transaction taxes on the gross profit earned from merchant hotel transactions; however, in a handful of jurisdictions, we have been required recently by passage of a new statute or by court order to start collecting and remitting certain taxes (local occupancy and/or sales or excise tax) imposed upon our margin and/or service fee, or in the case of Hawaii, on the full amount collected from the consumer. The ultimate resolution of these matters in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have established an accrual (including estimated interest and penalties) for potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. We accrue for legal contingencies where it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated; our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of gross profit represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. The ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. •Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient's service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance ""contingency"") which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results. Stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 includes charges amounting to $20.6 million, $24.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, representing the impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share units. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we periodically review actual forfeitures. To the extent that actual forfeiture rates differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised.•Valuation of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to determine 46the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate the purchase price consideration between identifiable intangible assets from goodwill. Our estimates of the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable and, when appropriate, include assistance from a third party valuation firm. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. Excluding OpenTable, which was acquired in July 2014, the estimated fair value of our other reporting units substantially exceed their respective carrying values. Since the annual impairment test in September 2014, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment. Additionally, we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset's future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value represents the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life.As a result of our recent acquisitions of OpenTable and KAYAK in July 2014 and May 2013, respectively, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Refer to Note 20 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2015, we intend to invest in OpenTable to accelerate its global expansion, increase the value offered to its restaurant partners and enhance the end-to-end experience for customers across desktop and mobile devices. As a result, we expect OpenTable's profitability in 2015 to decline year-over-year as we invest for future growth. If the investments we intend to make in 2015 and beyond, in particular internationally, are unsuccessful in growing OpenTable's global online restaurant reservation business or OpenTable experiences a significant reduction in revenues or profitability due to factors such as competition, increased capital expenditures or investments in its business, we may incur an impairment. Likewise, if KAYAK is unsuccessful in profitably growing its global online travel brand or it experiences a significant reduction in advertising revenues on its websites or mobile apps or profitability due to factors such as a loss of continued access to travel services information provided by other OTAs or travel service providers, we may incur an impairment charge.•Income Taxes. We determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences, and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. To date, we have been audited in several taxing jurisdictions with no significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more likely than not outcomes or we may adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. We intend to reinvest our foreign earnings in our non-U.S. operations. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had approximately $7.3 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, of foreign earnings indefinitely reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") and the International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB"") issued a new accounting standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers that is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions. The core principle of the standard is that an ""entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services."" Additionally, the new 47guidance specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. The new standard will also require enhanced disclosures. The accounting standard is effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted under U.S. GAAP and retrospective application is permitted but not required. We are currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements of adopting this new guidance. In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting update which amends the definition of a discontinued operation. The new definition limits discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The new definition includes an acquired business that is classified as held for sale at the date of acquisition. The accounting update requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and a disposal of an individually significant component of an entity. The accounting update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. We adopted this update in the first quarter of 2015 and this accounting update did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.In July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting update which provides guidance on financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward exists in the same taxing jurisdiction. Per this guidance, an entity must present the unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction to a deferred tax asset, except when the carryforward is not available as of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle taxes or the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose. This amendment does not impact the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions or the disclosure reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits. The update is effective for public companies beginning after December 15, 2013. We adopted this update in the first quarter of 2014 and this accounting update did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 48Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2014 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel related services. Specifically, reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units purchased by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked by our customers and is widely used in the travel business. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by our Booking.com, agoda.com and rentalcars.com businesses and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by our priceline.com business, in each case regardless of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while making a reservation or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. We follow a similar approach for reporting the international and domestic revenue and gross profit of those businesses.Gross bookings resulting from accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our international and U.S. operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 ChangeInternational$43,639 $33,300 31.0%Domestic6,661 5,873 13.4%Total$50,300 $39,173 28.4% Gross bookings increased by 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the same period in 2013 (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 30%), principally due to growth of 27.9% in accommodation room night reservations, 3% growth on a local currency basis in accommodation ADRs, growth of 18.1% in rental car day reservations and 12.0% growth in airline ticket reservations. International gross bookings grew by 31.0% (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 33%) for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of growth in accommodation room night reservations for our Booking.com and agoda.com businesses, as well as growth in rental car day reservations for our rentalcars.com business. The U.S. Dollar significantly strengthened against the Euro during 2014, moving from an exchange rate of 1.38 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 1, 2014 to 1.21 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of December 31, 2014. The U.S. Dollar strengthened further in January 2015 to an exchange rate of 1.13 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 31, 2015. The U.S. Dollar has also strengthened against many other currencies since January 1, 2014. At these exchange rates, the growth of our total and international gross bookings, expressed in U.S. Dollars, will be significantly adversely impacted in 2015. We therefore believe that unit growth rates and total gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit growth on a local currency basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.Domestic gross bookings increased by 13.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increases in priceline.com's retail airline ticket, retail hotel, Express Deals® hotel and retail rental car services, partially offset by declines in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Travel service providers typically provide a limited amount of availability to opaque services like ours, especially during periods of healthy travel demand. As a result, the recent healthy travel environment in the United States has had an adverse impace on our access to availability for our opaque reservation services.Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): 49 Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 ChangeAgency$42,892 $32,672 31.3%Merchant7,409 6,501 14.0%Total$50,300 $39,173 28.4% Agency gross bookings increased 31.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to growth in Booking.com accommodation room night reservations, priceline.com's retail airline ticket, rental car and hotel reservation services, and rentalcars.com rental car reservation service. Merchant gross bookings increased 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increases in agoda.com hotel reservation services, rentalcars.com rental car reservation services and priceline.com Express Deals® hotel and retail hotel reservation services, partially offset by declines in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® services.Units sold for accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 ChangeRoom Nights346.0 270.5 27.9%Rental Car Days51.8 43.9 18.1%Airline Tickets7.8 7.0 12.0% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 27.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to an increase in Booking.com, agoda.com and priceline.com accommodation room night reservations. Booking.com, our most significant brand, included over 600,000 properties on its website as of February 13, 2015, which included over 245,000 vacation rental properties, compared to approximately 425,000 properties as of February 18, 2014, which included over 110,000 vacation rental properties (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added properties over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in our newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate and our core European market.Rental car day reservations increased by 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to an increase in price-disclosed rental car day reservations for rentalcars.com and priceline.com, partially offset by a decline in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® rental car reservation service.Airline ticket reservations increased by 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to an increase in price-disclosed airline ticket reservations for priceline.com driven primarily by increased paid advertising placements on KAYAK (which began in the third quarter of 2013), partially offset by a decline in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservation service. RevenuesWe classify our revenue into three categories: •Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the travel services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, GDS reservation booking fees related to certain travel services, travel insurance fees and customer processing fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Substantially all of the revenue for Booking.com is agency revenue comprised of travel commissions. •Merchant revenues are derived from services where we are the merchant of record and therefore charge the customer's credit card for the travel services provided. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the price of Name Your Own Price® hotel, rental car and airline ticket reservations and vacation 50packages charged to a customer; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged to us by travel service providers in connection with (a) the accommodation reservations provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel reservation services at agoda.com and priceline.com and (b) the reservations provided through our merchant rental car service at rentalcars.com and merchant Express Deals® reservation services at priceline.com; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services, Express Deals® reservation services and merchant price-disclosed hotel reservation services; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. •Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (1) revenues earned by KAYAK for sending referrals to OTAs and travel service providers; (2) advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps; (3) reservation revenues earned by OpenTable (a fee for restaurant guests seated through OpenTable's online reservation service); (4) subscription fees earned by OpenTable for restaurant reservation management services; and (5) revenues generated by Booking.com's hotel marketing services. Revenue from KAYAK is net of intercompany revenues earned by KAYAK from other Priceline Group brands.

Our priceline.com agency revenues benefited from growth in our retail rental car, agency airline ticket and agency hotel reservation businesses.Merchant RevenuesMerchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased 1.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to decreases in revenues from priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services, mostly offset by increases in our agoda.com business, rentalcars.com business, priceline.com's Express Deals® and retail merchant hotel reservation services and priceline.com's Express Deals® rental car reservation services. Merchant revenue declined versus the prior year despite growth in merchant gross bookings, because our merchant revenues are disproportionately affected by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® service. Name Your Own Price® revenues, which declined year-over-year, are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and represented a smaller percentage, year-over-year, of total revenues compared to our faster-growing agoda.com, rentalcars.com and priceline.com retail merchant hotel and Express Deals® reservation services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business.Advertising and Other RevenuesAdvertising and other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of advertising revenues, restaurant reservation revenues and subscription revenues for restaurant reservation management services. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes $100.6 million of OpenTable revenue earned since its acquisition on July 24, 2014. Cost of Revenues Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeCost of Revenues$857,841 $1,077,420 (20.4)% 51Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2014, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost paid to travel service providers for priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services, net of applicable taxes and charges; (2) fees paid to third parties by KAYAK and priceline.com to return travel itinerary information in response to search queries; and (3) costs related to accruals for travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by 20.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a decrease in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes an accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2013 of approximately $20.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia, partially offset by a reduction in our accrual related to travel transaction taxes of $6.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013, principally related to a favorable agreement and ruling in the District of Columbia.Agency revenues have no cost of revenue. Agency revenues principally consist of travel commissions on accommodation reservations. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeGross Profit$7,584,130 $5,715,886 32.7%Gross Margin89.8% 84.1% Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 32.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 34%), primarily as a result of the increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in the year ended December 31, 2014 these revenues represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in the year ended December 31, 2013. Our retail and semi-opaque reservation services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel provider cost have been growing faster than priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $6.6 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014, which compares to $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 34% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses increased by approximately 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was positively impacted by the inclusion of OpenTable and KAYAK since their acquisitions on July 24, 2014 and May 21, 2013, respectively. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was negatively impacted by an accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2013 of approximately $20.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia, partially offset by a credit in the fourth quarter of 2013 of $6.3 million, principally related to a favorable agreement and ruling in the District of Columbia. The U.S. Dollar is significantly stronger against the Euro and many other currencies as of January 31, 2015 compared to 2014. At these exchange rates, the growth of our total and international gross bookings, expressed in U.S. Dollars, will be significantly adversely impacted in 2015. 52Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeOnline Advertising$2,360,221 $1,798,645 31.2%% of Total Gross Profit31.1% 31.5% Offline Advertising$231,309 $127,459 81.5%% of Total Gross Profit3.0% 2.2% Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; and (4) banner, pop-up and other Internet and mobile advertisements.

Online advertising as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from the inclusion of KAYAK and OpenTable because they spend a lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brands. Also, our consolidated results exclude intercompany advertising by our brands on KAYAK since the acquisition on May 21, 2013. In addition, the share of our business coming directly to our websites with no associated online advertising expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2014. These favorable impacts were almost entirely offset for the year ended December 31, 2014 by (1) a year-over-year decline in advertising ROIs and (2) brand mix within The Priceline Group as Booking.com, agoda.com and rentalcars.com grew faster than priceline.com and typically spend a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising, trends that we expect to continue. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was negatively impacted by an accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2013 of approximately $20.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia, partially offset by a reduction in our accrual related to travel transaction taxes of $6.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013, principally related to a favorable agreement and ruling in the District of Columbia.Offline advertising expenses are primarily related to our Booking.com, KAYAK and priceline.com businesses and primarily consist of television advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2014, offline advertising increased 81.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the launch of offline advertising campaigns by Booking.com in Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada in 2014 and Australia in the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as incremental offline advertising by KAYAK. Offline advertising growth for the year ended December 31, 2014 was also impacted by the inclusion of KAYAK in our consolidated results since its acquisition on May 21, 2013.Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeSales and Marketing$310,910 $235,817 31.8%% of Total Gross Profit4.1% 4.1% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency accommodation commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2014, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes, higher public relations costs and the inclusion of OpenTable since its acquisition on July 24, 2014. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of gross profit are typically higher for our merchant businesses, which incur credit card processing fees. Our merchant business grew more slowly than our agency business, and as a result, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 were favorably impacted compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This impact was offset during the year ended December 31, 2014 by the inclusion of OpenTable in our consolidated results since its acquisition on July 24, 2014 because OpenTable spends a higher percentage of gross profit on sales and marketing than our agency businesses. 53Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangePersonnel$950,191 $698,692 36.0%% of Total Gross Profit12.5% 12.2% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our businesses. The inclusion of OpenTable and KAYAK in our consolidated results since their acquisitions on July 24, 2014 and May 21, 2013, respectively, contributed to this increase in personnel expenses. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $140.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 includes charges amounting to $20.6 million and $24.1 million, respectively, representing the impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for outstanding unvested performance share units. Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 also includes $26.5 million of compensation expense related to 2014 acquisitions.In December 2013, the Dutch Government enacted certain amendments to Dutch tax law including a one-time irrevocable levy on an employer applied to employee earnings, equal to 16% of an employee's earnings in excess of 150,000 Euros. This levy resulted in additional payroll taxes recorded in personnel expense of approximately $12 million (approximately $9 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2013. There was no similar tax levy in 2014.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$352,869 $252,994 39.5%% of Total Gross Profit4.7% 4.4% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) personnel related expenses such as travel, recruiting and training expenses; and (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to higher occupancy and office expenses related to the expansion of our international businesses and higher personnel related expenses related to increased headcount in all of our businesses. The inclusion of OpenTable and KAYAK in our consolidated results since their acquisitions on July 24, 2014 and May 21, 2013, respectively, contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 included approximately $6.9 million of professional fees related to consummated acquisitions. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 included approximately $8.5 million of professional fees related to the acquisition of KAYAK. 54Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeInformation Technology$97,498 $71,890 35.6%% of Total Gross Profit1.3% 1.3% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; (3) outsourced data center costs; and (4) payments to outside consultants. Information technology expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations. The inclusion of OpenTable and KAYAK in our consolidated results since their acquisitions on July 24, 2014 and May 21, 2013, respectively, contributed to the increase in information technology expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$207,820 $117,975 76.2%% of Total Gross Profit2.7% 2.1% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) depreciation of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to increased intangible amortization from the OpenTable and KAYAK acquisitions and increased depreciation expense due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com business. Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeInterest Income$13,933 $4,167 234.4 %Interest Expense(88,353) (83,289) 6.1 %Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(9,444) (36,755) (74.3)%Total$(83,864) $(115,877) (27.6)% For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance and higher yields. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to interest expense attributable to our Senior Notes issued in August 2014 and September 2014 and interest expense attributable to our Senior Convertible Notes issued in May 2013, partially offset by early conversions of our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2015. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange gains of $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with foreign exchange gains of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 55Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, of $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to foreign exchange transaction losses of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we delivered cash of $122.9 million to repay the aggregate principal amount and issued 300,256 shares of our common stock and paid cash of $2.2 million in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount associated with our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2015 that were converted prior to maturity. The conversion of our convertible debt prior to maturity resulted in a non-cash loss of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a non-cash loss of $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which is recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$567,695 $403,739 40.6% Our effective tax rates, expressed as income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 19.0% and 17.6%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to lower tax rates outside the United States, partially offset by U.S. state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. Our effective tax rate was higher for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the acquisitions of OpenTable on July 24, 2014 and KAYAK on May 21, 2013, both of which are principally taxed at the higher U.S. tax rates.Under Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying ""innovative"" activities is taxed at a rate of 5% (""Innovation Box Tax"") rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. Booking.com obtained a ruling from the Dutch tax authorities confirming that a portion of its earnings is eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment. The ruling from the Dutch tax authorities is valid through December 31, 2017. Until our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire, most of our U.S. income will not be subject to a cash tax liability, other than federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes. However, we expect to pay foreign taxes on our non-U.S. income except in countries where we have operating loss carryforwards. We expect that our international operations will grow their pretax income faster than the U.S. business over the long term and, therefore, it is our expectation that our cash tax payments will increase as our international businesses generate an increasing share of our pre-tax income. We will be subject to increased income taxes in the event that our cash balances held outside the United States are remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2014, we held approximately $6.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments outside of the United States. We currently intend to use our cash held outside the United States to reinvest in our non-U.S. operations. If our cash balances outside the United States continue to grow and our ability to reinvest those balances outside the United States diminishes, it will become increasingly likely that we will be subject to additional income tax expense in the United States with respect to our unremitted non-U.S. earnings. We would not make additional income tax payments unless we were to actually repatriate our international cash to the United States. We would pay only U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and certain U.S. state income taxes as long as we have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset our U.S. taxable income. This could result in us being subject to a cash income tax liability on the earnings of our U.S. businesses sooner than would otherwise have been the case.Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests$— $135 NA We purchased the remaining outstanding shares underlying the redeemable noncontrolling interests in April 2013. 56Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2013 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Operating and Statistical Metrics Gross bookings resulting from accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our international and U.S. operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 ChangeInternational$33,300 $23,370 42.5%Domestic5,873 5,086 15.5%Total$39,173 $28,456 37.7% Gross bookings increased by 37.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012 (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 38%), principally due to growth of 36.9% in accommodation room night reservations and growth of 37.0% in rental car day reservations. The 42.5% increase in international gross bookings (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 42%) was primarily attributable to growth in hotel and accommodation room night reservations for our Booking.com and agoda.com businesses, as well as growth in rental car day reservations for our rentalcars.com business. Domestic gross bookings increased by 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in priceline.com's retail airline ticket service, Express Deals® hotel reservation service, and retail rental car service, partially offset by a decline in our Name Your Own Price® opaque hotel reservation service (driven in part by customer shift to Express Deals®). Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 ChangeAgency$32,672 $23,284 40.3%Merchant6,501 5,172 25.7%Total$39,173 $28,456 37.7% Agency gross bookings increased 40.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to growth in Booking.com accommodation room night reservations, as well as growth in priceline.com's retail airline ticket and rental car services. Merchant gross bookings increased 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the sale of agoda.com accommodation room night reservations, priceline.com Express Deals® hotel room night reservations, rentalcars.com rental car day reservations and Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservations, partially offset by a decline in our Name Your Own Price® opaque hotel reservation service. Units sold for accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 ChangeRoom Nights270.5 197.5 36.9%Rental Car Days43.9 32.0 37.0%Airline Tickets7.0 6.4 9.1% 57Accommodation room night reservations increased by 36.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013, over the same period in 2012, principally due to an increase in Booking.com, agoda.com and priceline.com Express Deals® and retail accommodation room night reservations, partially offset by a decline in our Name Your Own Price® opaque hotel room night reservations in part due to a concerted effort to emphasize Express Deals® over Name Your Own Price® in our offline advertising campaigns. Booking.com, our most significant brand, includes over 425,000 properties on its website as compared to about 275,000 properties last year (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added properties over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in these newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate and our core European market. Our priceline.com agency hotel reservations benefited from the integration of the growing number of properties on the Booking.com extranet.Rental car day reservations increased by 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013, over the same period in 2012, due to an increase in rental car day reservations for rentalcars.com and priceline.com.Airline ticket reservations increased by 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013, over the same period in 2012, due to an increase in Name Your Own Price® and price-disclosed airline ticket reservations. RevenuesWe classify our revenue into three categories: •Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the travel services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, GDS reservation booking fees related to certain travel services and customer processing fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Substantially all of the revenue for Booking.com is agency revenue comprised of travel commissions. •Merchant revenues are derived from services where we are the merchant of record and therefore charge the customer's credit card for the travel services provided. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night, rental car and airline ticket reservations and vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by travel service providers in connection with (a) the accommodation room reservations provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service at agoda.com and priceline.com and (b) the reservations provided through our merchant rental car service at rentalcars.com and merchant Express Deals® hotel service at priceline.com, which allows customers to see the price of the reservation prior to purchase but not the identity of the travel service provider; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night, rental car and airline ticket reservations and merchant price-disclosed hotel reservations; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. •Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from KAYAK for sending referrals to travel service providers and OTAs as well as from advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile applications. Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeAgency Revenues$4,410,689 $3,142,815 40.3%Merchant Revenues2,211,474 2,104,752 5.1%Advertising and Other Revenues171,143 13,389 1,178.2%Total Revenues$6,793,306 $5,260,956 29.1% 58Agency RevenuesAgency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 40.3% compared to the same period in 2012, primarily as a result of growth in the business of Booking.com. Our priceline.com agency revenues benefited from growth in our retail rental car business as well as the integration on the priceline.com website of the growing number of properties on the Booking.com extranet.Merchant RevenuesMerchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 5.1% compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to increases in our agoda.com hotel reservation service, rentalcars.com rental car reservation service and priceline.com Express Deals® hotel reservation and Name Your Own Price® air services, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® opaque hotel revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Merchant revenue growth over the prior year period was substantially lower than merchant gross bookings growth because our merchant revenues are disproportionately affected by our Name Your Own Price® service. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding supplier cost recorded in cost of revenues, and represented a smaller percentage, year-over-year, of total revenues compared to our faster-growing agoda.com, rentalcars.com and priceline.com Express Deals® services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of supplier cost. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business.Advertising and Other RevenuesAdvertising and other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of advertising revenues. Advertising revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes $154.5 million as a result of the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013, and excludes intercompany revenues earned by KAYAK from other Priceline Group brands. Cost of Revenues Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeCost of Revenues$1,077,420 $1,177,275 (8.5)% Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2013, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of Name Your Own Price® rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; (3) the cost of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (4) the cost of vacation packages from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (5) the cost related to accruals for travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by 8.5%, primarily due to a decrease in our Name Your Own Price® hotel reservation service, partially offset by increases in our other Name Your Own Price® services and higher accruals for travel transaction taxes. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes an accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2013 of approximately $20.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia, partially offset by a reduction in our accrual related to travel transaction taxes of $6.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013, principally related to a favorable agreement and ruling in the District of Columbia. Cost of revenue for the year ended December, 2012 includes an accrual of approximately $21 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and in the District of Columbia.Agency revenues have no cost of revenue. Agency revenues principally consist of travel commissions on accommodation reservations. 59Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeGross Profit$5,715,886 $4,083,681 40.0%Gross Margin84.1% 77.6% Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 40.0% compared to the same period in 2012, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by our Name Your Own Price® service. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in the year ended December 31, 2013 represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in the same period in 2012. Our retail and semi-opaque services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of supplier cost have been growing faster than our Name Your Own Price® services. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $5.02 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013, which compares to $3.56 billion for the same period in 2012. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 40% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses increased by approximately 32.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was positively impacted by the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was negatively impacted by an accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2013 of approximately $20.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia, partially offset by a credit in the fourth quarter of 2013 of $6.3 million, principally related to a favorable agreement and ruling in the District of Columbia. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 was negatively impacted by an accrual of approximately $21 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and in the District of Columbia.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, online advertising expenses increased 41.2% over the same period in 2012, primarily to generate increased gross bookings. Online advertising as a percentage of gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to (1) lower ROIs for our online advertising, (2) brand mix within The Priceline Group and (3) channel mix within certain of our brands. Our online advertising ROIs were down year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2013. Furthermore, our international brands are generally growing faster than our U.S. brands, and typically spend a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. Finally, certain of our brands are obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channels.The inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013 had a favorable impact on online advertising as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 because KAYAK spends a lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brands, and our consolidated results exclude intercompany advertising by our brands on 60KAYAK. This favorable impact will benefit year-over-year comparisons until the anniversary of the acquisition on May 21, 2014.Offline advertising expenses are related to our television, print and radio advertising for our Booking.com, priceline.com and KAYAK businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2013, offline advertising increased 259.1% compared to the same period in 2012, due mainly to Booking.com launching in the United States its first offline advertising campaign in 2013, as well as the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Booking.com also launched an offline advertising campaign in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2013. Booking.com recently launched offline advertising campaigns in Canada and the United Kingdom and may expand its offline advertising into other markets during 2014.Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeSales and Marketing$235,817 $195,934 20.4%% of Total Gross Profit4.1% 4.8% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency accommodation commission receivables; and (4) provisions for credit card chargebacks. For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2012, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as expenses related to increased content translations and the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of gross profit are typically higher for our merchant business, which incurs credit card processing fees. Our merchant business grew more slowly than our agency business, and as a result, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 declined compared to the same period in 2012. In addition, our agoda.com business achieved a year-over-year decline in its sales and marketing expense per transaction.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2012, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our businesses and the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $140.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $71.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Stock-based compensation expense of $30.9 million for KAYAK unvested assumed employee stock options and payroll taxes of $3.4 million for KAYAK stock option exercises were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 also includes charges amounting to $24.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for outstanding unvested performance share units.In July 2012 and December 2013, the Dutch Government enacted certain amendments to Dutch tax law including a one-time irrevocable levy on an employer applied to employee earnings, equal to 16% of an employee's earnings in excess of 150,000 Euros. This levy resulted in additional payroll taxes recorded in personnel expense of approximately $12 million (approximately $9 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately $14 million (approximately $10 million after tax) principally recorded in the third quarter of 2012. 61General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$252,994 $173,171 46.1%% of Total Gross Profit4.4% 4.2% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 over the same period in 2012, primarily due to higher recruiting, training and travel expenses related to increased headcount in all our businesses, higher occupancy and office expenses related to the expansion of our international businesses, and the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 included approximately $8.5 million of professional fees related to the acquisition of KAYAK. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes approximately $3 million of professional fees related to the acquisition of KAYAK and a charge of approximately $3 million related to certain leased space that was vacated in connection with the relocation of Booking.com's headquarters to a new location in Amsterdam. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeInformation Technology$71,890 $43,685 64.6%% of Total Gross Profit1.3% 1.1% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) outsourced data center costs; (2) system maintenance and software license fees; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2012 was due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations and the inclusion of KAYAK since its acquisition on May 21, 2013. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$117,975 $65,141 81.1%% of Total Gross Profit2.1% 1.6% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) depreciation of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2013, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2012 due primarily to intangible amortization from the KAYAK acquisition for $33.4 million, and increased depreciation expense due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com brand. 62Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeInterest Income$4,167 $3,860 8.0%Interest Expense(83,289) (62,064) 34.2%Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(36,755) (9,720) 278.1%Total$(115,877) $(67,924) 70.6% For the year ended December 31, 2013, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance partially offset by lower yields. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt resulting from the May 2013 issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes and the March 2012 issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange gains of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with foreign exchange gains of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, resulted in losses of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to foreign exchange transaction losses of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company delivered cash of $414.6 million to repay the aggregate principal amount and issued 972,235 shares of its common stock in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount associated with the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2015 that were converted prior to maturity. The conversion of our convertible debt prior to maturity resulted in a non-cash loss of $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, and is recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$403,739 $337,832 19.5% Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 17.6% and 19.2%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to lower tax rates outside the United States, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. Our effective tax rates were lower for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, due to growth in our international businesses. According to Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying ""innovative"" activities is taxed at a rate of 5% (""Innovation Box Tax"") rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. Booking.com obtained a ruling from the Dutch tax authorities in February 2011 confirming that a portion of its earnings is eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment. The ruling from the Dutch tax authorities is valid through December 31, 2017. 63Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 ChangeNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests$135 $4,471 (97.0)% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest is lower for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, mainly due to a reduction in redeemable noncontrolling interests. We purchased the remaining outstanding shares underlying the redeemable noncontrolling interests in April 2013. 64Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2014, we had $8.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments. Approximately $6.9 billion is held by our international subsidiaries and is denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, Euros and, to a lesser extent, British Pounds Sterling and other currencies. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the United States. If we repatriate cash to the United States, we would utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and beyond that amount incur additional tax payments in the United States. Cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term investments are comprised of U.S. and foreign corporate bonds, U.S. and foreign government securities, high grade commercial paper, foreign equity securities, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. municipal securities and bank deposits. In October 2011, we entered into a $1.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50%; or (ii) the greatest of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association's prime lending rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) an adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $50.0 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings under the facility, and approximately $4.0 million of letters of credit issued under the facility.On July 24, 2014, we acquired OpenTable, Inc., a leading provider of online restaurant reservations, in a cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $2.5 billion (approximately $2.4 billion net of cash acquired) or $103.00 per share of OpenTable common stock. We funded the acquisition from cash on hand in the United States and $995 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility, which was repaid during the third quarter of 2014.In August 2014, we issued in a private placement $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, with an interest rate of 0.9%. Interest on the notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year. We used approximately $147.3 million of the net proceeds to concurrently repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include repurchases of our common stock from time to time, repaying outstanding debt and corporate acquisitions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these notes.In August 2014, we used $500 million of our non-U.S. cash to invest in a five-year senior convertible note issued by Ctrip.com International Ltd. (""Ctrip""). Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we invested $421.9 million of our non-U.S. cash in Ctrip American Depositary Shares. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these investments. In September 2014, we issued 1.0 billion Euro aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2024, with an interest rate of 2.375%. Interest on the notes is payable annually on September 23, beginning September 23, 2015. We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include repurchases of our common stock from time to time, repaying outstanding debt and corporate acquisitions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these notes.In the third and fourth quarters of 2014, we repurchased 114,645 shares of our common stock in privately negotiated, off-market transactions and 438,897 shares of our common stock in the open market for aggregate costs of $147.3 million and $500.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had a remaining aggregate amount of $7.2 million authorized by our Board of Directors to purchase our common stock. On February 5, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $3.0 billion of our common stock. We may from time to time make additional repurchases of our common stock, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, and other factors.Our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our travel service providers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant seasonal swings in deferred merchant bookings and travel service provider payables depending on the absolute level of our merchant transactions during the last few weeks of every quarter. 65During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid $122.9 million to satisfy the aggregate principal amount due and issued 300,256 shares of our common stock and paid cash of $2.2 million in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount for debt converted prior to maturity related to the conversion of our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2015.Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $2.9 billion, resulting from net income of $2.4 billion and a favorable impact of non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $518.0 million, slightly offset by net unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $25.4 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2014, were primarily related to a $203.9 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $182.2 million increase in accounts receivable and $48.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and deferred income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013, was $2.3 billion, resulting from net income of $1.9 billion, a favorable impact of non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $355.7 million and net favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $52.9 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2013, were primarily related to a $182.2 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $111.6 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount, a non-cash loss on convertible notes converted prior to maturity, and deferred income taxes. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were affected by payments of $2.5 billion for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net cash payments of $80.3 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts slightly offset by net sales of investments of $350.3 million and a change in restricted cash of $9.3 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 were affected by net purchases of investments of $1.7 billion, payments of $331.9 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, a change in restricted cash of $2.8 million, and net cash payments of $78.6 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment was $131.5 million and $84.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in 2014 was related to additional data center capacity and new offices to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com business. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily consisted of total proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of Convertible Senior Notes and Euro denominated Senior Notes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $23.4 million and the exercise of employee stock options of $16.4 million, partially offset by treasury stock purchases of $750.4 million and payments of $125.1 million related to the conversion of Senior Notes. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $403.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily related to payments for treasury stock purchases of $883.5 million, $192.5 million spent to purchase the remaining shares underlying noncontrolling interests in rentalcars.com, $414.6 million to satisfy the aggregate principal amount due upon the early conversion of senior notes, and $1.0 million of debt issuance costs, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, $91.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, and $17.7 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.ContingenciesA number of jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against online travel companies, including us, related to, among other things, the payment of travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). In addition, a number of U.S. states, counties and municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of travel transaction taxes. To date, the majority of taxing jurisdictions in which we facilitate the making of travel reservations have not asserted that taxes are due and payable on our travel services. With respect to jurisdictions that have not initiated proceedings to date, it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statutes and seek to collect taxes from us only on a prospective basis. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these pending cases and proceedings and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Adverse application of state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations."" in this Annual Report. 66As a result of this litigation and other attempts by jurisdictions to levy similar taxes, we have established an accrual for the potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes in the amount of approximately $52 million at December 31, 2014 and approximately $55 million at December 31, 2013. Our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued. The actual cost may be less or greater, potentially significantly, than the liabilities recorded. An estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued cannot be reasonably made. We believe that, even if we were to suffer adverse determinations in the near term in more of the pending proceedings than currently anticipated given results to date, because of our available cash, it would not have a material impact on our liquidity.The following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2014 (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands)Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations $437,386 $79,902 $133,436 $93,157 $130,891Senior Notes(1) 4,681,331 102,891 102,478 1,084,534 3,391,428Revolving credit facility(2) 3,212 1,938 1,274 — —Earnout - acquisition 10,700 — — 10,700 —Total(3) $5,132,629 $184,731 $237,188 $1,188,391 $3,522,319_____________________________(1)Represents the aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and interest of $434 million. Convertible debt does not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or shares of common stock at our option. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Represents fees on uncommitted funds and outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2014.(3)We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $104 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014, of which approximately $52 million related to our accrual for the potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and approximately $32 million related to unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for these liabilities. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as ""non-current"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have excluded ""Other long-term liabilities"" in the amount of $93 million from the contractual obligations table because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. On December 15, 2014, our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 became convertible at the option of the holders without regard to our stock price and will remain convertible without regard to our stock price until the trading day prior to the maturity date of March 15, 2015. If the holders elect to convert, we will be required to pay the aggregate principal amount in cash and we have elected to deliver cash for the conversion value in excess of the aggregate principal amount. We would likely fund our conversion obligations from cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. 67Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2014. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2014, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future.Fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our available for sale investments assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments as of December 31, 2014 of approximately $85 million. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity.As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt is $4.2 billion. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2014. A substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount is related to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible bonds.We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euros). As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the operating results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency results in gains and losses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. Our derivative contracts principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the Euro and the British Pound Sterling versus the U.S. Dollar. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no such outstanding derivative contracts associated with foreign currency translation risk. Foreign exchange gains of $13.7 million, $0.3 million, and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, were recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 68",2023-12-30 18:44:28.091247

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include those discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and constant currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-period financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the prior-period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-period monthly average exchange rates.OverviewWe help people experience the world by providing consumers, travel service providers and restaurants with leading travel and restaurant reservation and related services. Through our online travel companies (""OTCs""), we connect consumers wishing to make travel reservations with providers of travel services around the world. We are the leader in the worldwide online accommodation reservation market based on room nights booked. We offer consumers a broad array of accommodation reservations (including hotels, bed and breakfasts, hostels, apartments, vacation rentals and other properties) through our Booking.com, priceline.com and agoda.com brands. Our priceline.com brand also offers consumers reservations for rental cars, airline tickets, vacation packages and cruises. We offer rental car reservations worldwide through rentalcars.com. We also allow consumers to easily compare airline ticket, hotel reservation and rental car reservation information from hundreds of travel websites at once through KAYAK. We provide restaurants with reservation management services and consumers with the ability to make restaurant reservations at participating restaurants through OpenTable, a leading provider of online restaurant reservations. We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands, including Booking.com, priceline.com, KAYAK, agoda.com, rentalcars.com, OpenTable and various smaller brands, collectively as ""The Priceline Group,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us.""We launched our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to include five other primary, independently operated brands: Booking.com, KAYAK, agoda.com, rentalcars.com and OpenTable. Our principal goal is to help people experience the world by serving both consumers and our travel service provider and restaurant partners with worldwide leadership in online reservation and related services. Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda.com and rentalcars.com and the results of the internationally-based websites of KAYAK and OpenTable (in each case regardless of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while making a reservation or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant). During the year ended December 31, 2015, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 88% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services booked by our customers, net of cancellations), approximately 86% of our consolidated gross profit and approximately 94% of our consolidated operating income. A significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information. We derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following sources:•Commissions earned from facilitating reservations of accommodations, rental cars, cruises and other travel services;•Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our accommodation, rental car, airline ticket and vacation package reservation services;•Beginning on May 21, 2013, advertising revenues primarily earned by KAYAK from sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers, as well as from advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps;•Beginning on July 24, 2014, revenues recognized by OpenTable, which consist of reservation revenues (reservation fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service), subscription fees for restaurant reservation management services and other revenues; and•Damage excess waiver fees, travel insurance fees and global distribution system (""GDS"") reservation booking fees, in each case related to certain of our travel services. 40Our priceline.com brand offers merchant Name Your Own Price® opaque travel services, which are recorded in revenue on a ""gross"" basis and have associated cost of revenue. All of our other services are recorded in revenue on a ""net"" basis and have no associated cost of revenue. Therefore, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of our revenues between Name Your Own Price® travel services and other services. Gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for all of our services. Consequently, gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business because, in contrast to our revenues, it is not affected by the different methods of recording revenue and cost of revenue between our Name Your Own Price® travel reservation services and our other services. TrendsOver the last several years we have experienced strong growth in our accommodation reservation services. We believe this growth is the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the widespread adoption of mobile devices, the high growth of travel overall in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and South America, and the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to build accommodation supply, content and distribution and to improve the consumer experience on our websites and mobile apps. These year-over-year growth rates have generally decelerated in recent years. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our accommodation room night reservation growth was 25%, a deceleration from 28% in 2014, 37% in 2013 and 40% in 2012. Given the size of our hotel reservation business, we expect that our year-over-year growth rates will continue to decelerate, though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate.The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet use and e-commerce activity of international consumers have trailed that of consumers in the United States. However, international consumers are increasingly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. We expect that over the long term, international online travel growth rates will follow a similar trend to that experienced in the United States. In addition, the base of hotel properties in Europe and Asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the leading online accommodation reservation service provider in the world as measured by room nights booked. We believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the markets in which we operate.Our growth has primarily been generated by our worldwide accommodation reservation service brand, Booking.com, which is our most significant brand, and has been due, in part, to the availability of a large and growing number of directly bookable properties through Booking.com. Booking.com included over 850,000 properties on its website as of February 15, 2016, which included approximately 390,000 vacation rental properties (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website), and compares to over 635,000 properties (including approximately 269,000 vacation rental properties) a year ago. In September 2015, Booking.com changed the way it calculates property counts. As a result, properties that are contracted with Booking.com but temporarily do not have availability on Booking.com (for example properties that are closed during their off-peak season or for renovations) will remain included in Booking.com's property counts during these temporary periods. Booking.com previously excluded properties that were temporarily unavailable for booking. We believe that continuously including them provides a more consistent and useful property count. We believe that continuing to expand the number and variety of accommodations available through our services, in particular Booking.com, will help us to continue to grow our accommodation reservation business.As our international business represents the substantial majority of our financial results, we expect our operating results and other financial metrics to continue to be largely driven by international performance. For example, certain markets in which we operate that are in earlier stages of development have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets, which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as these markets increase in size over time. Also, we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodations available for reservation on our websites, including hotels, bed and breakfasts, hostels and vacation rentals. Vacation rentals generally consist of, among others, properties categorized as single-unit and multi-unit villas, apartments, ""aparthotels"" (which are apartments with a front desk and cleaning service) and chalets and are generally self-catered (i.e., include a kitchen), directly bookable properties. The approximately 390,000 vacation rental properties on Booking.com's website as of February 15, 2016 (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com's website) represent approximately 1.9 million instantly bookable and confirmable units within these properties. Many of the newer accommodations we add to our travel reservation services, especially in highly penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms, lower average daily rates (""ADRs"") or higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of consumers (e.g., hostels and bed and breakfasts), and therefore may also negatively impact our margins. For example, because a vacation rental is either a single unit or a small collection of independent units, vacation rental properties represent more limited booking 41opportunities than non-vacation rental properties, which generally have more units to rent per property. Our non-hotel accommodations in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism seasons, weather or other factors. As we increase our non-hotel accommodation business, these different market characteristics could negatively impact our profit margins; and, to the extent these properties represent an increasing percentage of the properties added to our websites, we expect that our gross bookings growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time (since each such property has fewer booking opportunities). As a result of the foregoing, as the percentage of non-hotel accommodations increases, we expect that the number of reservations per property will likely continue to decrease. Concerns persist about the outlook for the global economy in general, including the European Union, with recent declines in broad Eurozone economic indicators raising fears about the pace of economic growth and the risk of deflation. In addition, many governments around the world, including the U.S. government and certain European governments, continue to operate at large financial deficits, resulting in high levels of sovereign debt in such countries. Greece, Ireland, Portugal and certain other European Union countries with high levels of sovereign debt at times have had difficulty refinancing their debt. Failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solutions to these issues has resulted in a high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook. This uncertainty, as well as concern over governmental austerity measures including higher taxes and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. At times, we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates and cancellation rates and weaker trends in hotel ADRs across many regions of the world, particularly in those European countries that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainties. We believe that these business trends are likely impacted by weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. Similarly, while China's economy experienced rapid growth over the past 20 years, growth of the Chinese economy slowed in 2015 and concerns about its future growth have had an adverse impact on financial markets, currency exchange rates and other economies. Disruptions in the economies of such countries could cause, contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro-economic conditions, which in turn could negatively affect travel to or from such countries or the travel industry in general and therefore have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Greece, in particular, has recently faced and continues to face significant economic challenges, in large part due to its high levels of sovereign debt and difficulties refinancing that debt. This may increase the likelihood that Greece, and in turn other countries, could exit the European Union, which could lead to added economic uncertainty and further devaluation or eventual abandonment of the Euro common currency. These and other macro-economic uncertainties, such as sovereign default risk becoming more widespread, declining oil prices and geopolitical tensions, have led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the Euro, the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. In March 2015, the European Central Bank, in an effort to stimulate the European economy, launched a quantitative easing program to purchase public debt. As noted earlier, our international business represents a substantial majority of our financial results. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international businesses are translated from local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. The U.S. Dollar significantly strengthened against the Euro during 2014, moving from an exchange rate of 1.38 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 1, 2014 to 1.21 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of December 31, 2014. The U.S. Dollar strengthened further in 2015 to an exchange rate of 1.09 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of December 31, 2015. The U.S. Dollar also strengthened significantly during this time frame as compared to many other currencies. As a result, our foreign currency denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses and net income have been negatively impacted as expressed in U.S. Dollars. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. The aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes, and accrued interest thereon, provide a natural hedge of the net assets of certain of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries.Gross profit from our international operations grew year-over-year on a constant currency basis by approximately 28% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, but, as a result of the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, grew 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, as reported in U.S. Dollars. We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. However, such derivative instruments are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuations that could impact our gross bookings, revenues or gross profit (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts).Significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, stock markets and oil prices can also impact consumer travel behavior. Consumers traveling from a country whose currency has weakened against other currencies may book lower ADR accommodations, choose to shorten or cancel their international travel plans or choose to travel domestically rather than internationally, any of which could adversely affect our gross bookings, revenues and results of operations, in particular when expressed in U.S. Dollars. For example, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro in 2015 resulted in it 42becoming more expensive for Europeans to travel to the United States. Similarly, dramatic depreciation of the Russian Ruble in 2014 and 2015 resulted in it becoming more expensive for Russians to travel to Europe and most other non-Ruble destinations. In addition, although lower oil prices may lead to increased travel activity as consumers have more discretionary funds and airline fares decrease, recent declines in oil prices and stock market volatility may be indicative of broader macro-economic weakness, which in turn could negatively affect the travel industry and our business.The uncertainty of macro-economic factors, the volatility in foreign exchange rates and their impact on consumer behavior, which may differ across regions, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our results of operations.We compete with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The market for the services we offer is intensely competitive, a trend we expect to continue, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. We currently, or may potentially in the future, compete with a variety of companies, including:•online travel reservation services such as those owned by Expedia (including Travelocity and Orbitz), Ctrip (in which we hold a minority interest), Rakuten, eDreams ODIGEO and Jalan; •online accommodation search and/or reservation services, such as Airbnb and HomeAway (which is owned by Expedia), currently focused on vacation rental properties and other non-hotel accommodations, including individually owned properties;•large online companies, including search, social networking and marketplace companies such as Google, Facebook, Alibaba and Groupon;•traditional travel agencies, wholesalers and tour operators, such as Carlson Wagonlit, American Express, Thomas Cook and Tui Travel, as well as thousands of individual travel agencies around the world;•travel service providers such as accommodation providers, rental car companies and airlines;•online travel search and price comparison services (generally referred to as ""meta-search"" services), such as TripAdvisor, trivago (in which Expedia holds a majority ownership interest), Qunar (which is controlled by Ctrip) and HotelsCombined;•online restaurant reservation services, such as TripAdvisor's LaFourchette, Yelp's SeatMe and Zomato; and•companies offering new rental car business models or car- or ride-sharing services that affect demand for rental cars, some of which have developed innovative technologies to improve efficiency of point-to-point transportation and extensively utilize mobile platforms, such as Uber, Lyft and Zipcar.For more detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face, see Part I Item 1 Business - ""Competition"" and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance."" and ""Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices create new challenges and may enable device companies such as Apple to compete directly with us.""During 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity, Orbitz and HomeAway. To the extent these acquisitions enhance Expedia's ability to compete with us, in particular in the United States, which is Expedia's, Travelocity's, Orbitz's and HomeAway's largest market, our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected.Widespread adoption of mobile devices, such as the iPhone, Android-enabled smart phones and tablets such as the iPad, coupled with the web browsing functionality and development of thousands of useful ""apps"" available on these devices, is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platforms. We have experienced a significant shift of business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Our major competitors and certain new market entrants are offering mobile apps for travel products and other mobile functionality, including proprietary last-minute discounts for accommodation reservations. Advertising and distribution opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes. The gross profit earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance. Further, given the device sizes and technical limitations of tablets and smart phones, mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple apps 43from multiple companies providing a similar service and instead prefer to use one or a limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity. As a result, the consumer experience with mobile apps as well as brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important. Our mobile offerings have received generally strong reviews and are driving a material and increasing share of our business. We believe that mobile bookings present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices instead of a personal computer. If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if our mobile offerings are not used by consumers, we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our business, future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we have observed an increase in promotional pricing to closed user groups (such as loyalty program participants or consumers with registered accounts), including through mobile apps. If we are not as effective as our competitors in offering discounted prices to closed user groups or if we are unable to entice members of our competitors' closed user groups to use our services, our ability to grow and compete could be harmed. If we need to fund discounts out of our gross profit, our profitability could be adversely affected. Further, growth in discounted closed user group retail prices for hotel rooms lessens the price difference for members of closed user groups between a retail hotel reservation and an opaque hotel reservation, which we believe has led to fewer consumers using our opaque hotel reservation services. In addition, hotels typically make available only a limited number of hotel rooms for opaque services like those of our priceline.com business, especially during periods of high occupancy. Recent high hotel occupancy levels in the United States (which have had an adverse impact on our access to hotel rooms for our opaque hotel reservation services) and, we believe, the increased use by consumers of discounted closed user group retail prices for hotel rooms have negatively affected our opaque hotel reservation gross profit.We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through aggressive marketing and promotional campaigns. Both our online and offline advertising expense has increased significantly in recent years, a trend we expect to continue. During 2015, our total online advertising expense was approximately $2.8 billion, primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our websites. We also invested approximately $215 million in offline advertising during that period. We intend to continue a strategy of aggressively promoting brand awareness, primarily through online means although we also intend to increase our offline advertising efforts, including by expanding offline campaigns into additional markets. For example, building on its first offline advertising campaign, which it launched in the United States in 2013, Booking.com has begun offline advertising campaigns in other markets, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Brazil and Japan. We have observed increased offline advertising by OTCs, meta-search services and travel service providers, particularly in North America, South America and Europe, which may make our offline advertising efforts more expensive and less effective.Online advertising efficiency, expressed as online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit, is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are, in some cases, outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers and the extent to which consumers come directly to our websites or mobile apps for bookings. For example, competition for desired rankings in search results and/or a decline in ad clicks by consumers could increase our costs-per-click and reduce our online advertising efficiency. From 2011 to 2013, our online advertising expense grew faster than our gross profit due to (1) year-over-year declines in online advertising returns on investment (""ROIs"") and (2) brand mix within The Priceline Group as our international brands grew faster than our U.S. brands and spent a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. In 2014, these long-term trends continued, but were more than offset by the inclusion of KAYAK and OpenTable because they spend a lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brands. Also, our consolidated results exclude intercompany advertising by our brands on KAYAK since our acquisition of KAYAK in May 2013. In 2015, online advertising efficiency declined compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower ROIs. If Google changes how it presents travel search results or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results in a manner that is competitively disadvantageous to us, whether to support its own travel-related services or otherwise, our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites could be harmed. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We rely on online advertising channels to enhance our brand awareness and to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites."" and ""Our business could be negatively affected by changes in Internet search engine algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.""The national competition authorities (""NCAs"") of many governments have begun investigations into competitive practices within the online travel industry, and we may be involved or affected by such investigations and their results. Various NCAs, including those in France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Sweden, Ireland and Switzerland, opened investigations of Booking.com's contractual parity arrangements with accommodation providers in those jurisdictions, and a number of other NCAs are looking at these issues. It is uncertain how these issues will finally be resolved. For example, the French, Italian and Swedish NCAs accepted commitments offered by Booking.com to resolve and close their investigations and Booking.com 44voluntarily implemented these commitments throughout the European Economic Area and Switzerland on July 1, 2015, which resolved the concerns of various other countries. However, in August 2015 France adopted legislation known as the ""Macron Law"" making price parity agreements illegal, including those that had been approved by the French NCA. For more information on these investigations and their potential effects on our business, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""As the size of our business grows, we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti-trust and competition regulators."" To the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines or require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry or legislation is enacted with a similar effect, our business, competitive position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding any such investigations could adversely affect our brand and therefore our market share and results of operations.SeasonalityA meaningful amount of our gross bookings are generated early in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. From a cost perspective, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as the expense is incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which reservations are booked. However, we generally do not recognize associated revenue until future quarters when the travel occurs. As a result, we have historically experienced our highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of accommodation checkouts for the year for our European and North American businesses. We experience the highest levels of booking and travel consumption for our Asia-Pacific and South American businesses in the first and fourth quarters. As these businesses have generally been growing faster than our European and North American businesses, our operating results for the fourth quarter of the year have become more significant over time as a percentage of full year operating results. In addition, the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results. For example, in 2013 our second quarter year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were adversely affected by Easter falling in the first quarter instead of the second quarter, as it did in 2012. Conversely, our second quarter 2014 year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were favorably impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, as it did in 2013. Similarly to 2013, in 2016 Easter will fall in the first quarter instead of the second quarter, and will therefore likely have a positive effect on our first quarter 2016 year-over-year growth rates and a negative effect on our second quarter 2016 year-over-year growth rates as compared to the same periods in 2015 when Easter fell in the second quarter.The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business. For example, in periods where our growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable advertising expense. In addition, gross profit growth is typically less impacted in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters.Other FactorsWe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel and travel-related services and further expand into other international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Zika, Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu, SARS and MERS, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities or travel-related accidents, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, our business and operations were negatively impacted by the terror attacks in Paris in November 2015; Hurricane Sandy, which disrupted travel in the northeastern United States in late 2012; a major earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency in Japan in 2011; severe flooding in Thailand in October 2011; and disruptive civil unrest in Thailand in 2010 and 2014. In addition, MERS had an adverse impact on our business in northeast Asia in 2015. Future terrorist attacks, natural disasters, health concerns or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operations.We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. We have experienced pressure on operating margins as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth. For example, we are investing in growth initiatives at OpenTable, including international expansion, and in building our BookingSuite partner-facing software services platform. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability. 45Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:•Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient's service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance ""contingency"") which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results. Stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes charges amounting to $22.6 million, $20.6 million and $24.1 million, respectively, representing the impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share units. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we periodically review actual forfeitures. To the extent that actual forfeiture rates differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised.•Valuation of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair value are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable and, when we deem appropriate, include assistance from a third party valuation firm. The purchase price consideration is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price consideration over the net of the amounts allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date.We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. As of September 30, 2015, we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units using standard valuation techniques and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. A substantial portion of our intangibles and goodwill relates to our acquisitions of OpenTable in July 2014 and KAYAK in May 2013. Other than OpenTable, the fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values as of September 30, 2015. Since the annual impairment test in September 2015, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment. As of September 30, 2015, OpenTable’s carrying value was $2.5 billion, of which $1.5 billion relates to goodwill. The fair value of OpenTable slightly exceeded its carrying value as of September 30, 2015. OpenTable’s fair value was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approaches (EBITDA multiples of comparable 46publicly-traded companies and for precedent transactions). We also performed sensitivity analysis, calculating estimated fair values using different rates for the weighted-average cost of capital in the income approach and different EBITDA multiples in our market approach. OpenTable’s estimated fair value remained in excess of its carrying value. Since the acquisition, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, in OpenTable to accelerate its global expansion, increase the value offered to its restaurant partners and enhance the end-to-end experience for consumers across desktop and mobile devices. As expected, these investments resulted in lower OpenTable post-acquisition EBITDA compared to pre-acquisition levels. In addition, the time required to execute these investments has exceeded our initial expectations. Despite the delays, we continue to believe that these investments will result in significant future earnings. Future events and changing market conditions may, however, lead us to reevaluate the assumptions we have used to test for goodwill impairment, including key assumptions regarding OpenTable's expected growth rates and operating margins, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates, currency exchange rates and market EBITDA comparables. If OpenTable’s investments, in particular its investments in its global expansion efforts, are not successful, there is a substantial likelihood that we would recognize a related goodwill impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset's future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value represents the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life.•Income Taxes. We determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences, and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. To date, we have been audited in several taxing jurisdictions with no significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more likely than not outcomes or we may adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. We intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign undistributed earnings in our non-U.S. operations. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately $9.9 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively, of cumulative undistributed international earnings. It is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Classification of Deferred Taxes and Presentation of Debt Issuance CostsIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting update which requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. This update is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of this update is permitted and an entity may choose to adopt this update on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We adopted this accounting update in the fourth quarter of 2015 and applied it retrospectively to prior periods. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of adopting this standard. In April 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting update which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in our financial statements. Under this new guidance, debt issuance costs, excluding costs associated with a revolving credit facility, 47will be presented in our balance sheets as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. This accounting change is consistent with the current presentation under U.S. GAAP for debt discounts and it also converges the guidance under U.S. GAAP with that in the International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""). Debt issuance costs will reduce the proceeds from debt borrowings in our cash flow statement instead of being presented as a separate line in the financing section of that statement. Amortization of debt issuance costs will continue to be reported as interest expense in our income statement. This accounting update does not affect the current accounting guidance for the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. This update is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is allowed for all entities for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We adopted this accounting update in the fourth quarter of 2015 and applied it retrospectively to prior periods. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of adopting this standard. Other Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn January 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting update which amends the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the accounting update retains many current requirements, it significantly revises accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The accounting update also amends certain fair value disclosures of financial instruments and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale debt securities in combination with the entity’s evaluation of their other deferred tax assets. The update requires entities to carry all investments in equity securities, including other ownership interests such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies at fair value, with fair value changes recognized through net income. This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for equity method accounting, investments that result in consolidation of the investee or investments in which the entity has elected the practicability exception to fair value measurement. Under current U.S. GAAP, our available-for-sale investments in equity securities with readily identifiable market value are remeasured to fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). However, under the new accounting literature, fair value adjustments will be recognized through net income and could vary significantly quarter to quarter. For the investments currently accounted for under the cost method, an entity can elect to measure its investments, which do not have a readily determinable fair value, at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Additionally, this accounting update will simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. In addition, this accounting update eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is currently required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost in the balance sheet. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption, although allowed in certain circumstances, is not applicable to us.In September 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting update which simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. Under this new guidance, an acquirer must recognize these adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The new accounting guidance also requires an acquirer to present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to provision amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We adopted this new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2015 and this accounting standard did not have an impact to our consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting update which requires an entity that enters into a cloud computing arrangement to determine if the arrangement contains a software license. The accounting update cites software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service and other similar hosting arrangements as examples of cloud computing arrangements. A software license arrangement exists if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the customer has a contractual right to take possession of the underlying software without significant penalty and (2) it is feasible for the customer to run the software on their own hardware or to contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to run the software. If the arrangement meets both of these criteria, the customer would need to identify what portion of the cost relates to purchasing the software and what portion relates to paying for the service of hosting the software. The purchased software would be accounted for using the internal-use software guidance and the service costs would be accounted for as an operating expense. If the arrangement does not meet both of the criteria, the cost is an operating expense for a service contract. The guidance in this update does not change the accounting for a service contract. The update is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is allowed for all 48entities. We adopted this accounting update in the fourth quarter of 2015 and this accounting update did not have an impact to our consolidated financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB"") issued a new accounting standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers that is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions. The core principle of the standard is that an ""entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services."" Additionally, the new guidance specified the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. The new standard will also require enhanced disclosures. The accounting standard was initially effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact to our consolidated financial statements of adopting this new guidance. In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting update which amended the definition of a discontinued operation. The new definition limits discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The new definition includes an acquired business that is classified as held for sale at the date of acquisition. The accounting update requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and a disposal of an individually significant component of an entity. The accounting update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. We adopted this update in the first quarter of 2015 and this accounting update did not have an impact to our consolidated financial statements. 49Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-related services. Specifically, reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by our Booking.com, agoda.com and rentalcars.com businesses and U.S. gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by our priceline.com business, in each case regardless of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while making a reservation or the location of the travel service provider. We follow a similar approach for reporting the international and U.S. revenue and gross profit of those businesses.Gross bookings resulting from accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our international and U.S. operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 ChangeInternational$48,971 $43,639 12.2 %U.S.6,557 6,661 (1.6)%Total$55,528 $50,300 10.4 % Gross bookings increased by 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 25%), principally due to growth of 24.9% in accommodation room night reservations, 2% growth on a constant currency basis in ADRs and growth of 15.6% in rental car day reservations, partially offset by the impact foreign exchange rate fluctuations. International gross bookings grew by 12.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 28%). International gross bookings growth on a constant currency basis was primarily attributable to growth in accommodation room night reservations for our Booking.com and agoda.com businesses, as well as international ADR growth on a constant currency basis and growth in rental car day reservations for our rentalcars.com business. The U.S. Dollar significantly strengthened against the Euro during 2015, moving from an exchange rate of 1.21 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 1, 2015 to 1.09 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of December 31, 2015. The U.S. Dollar has also strengthened against many other currencies since January 1, 2015. We therefore believe that unit growth rates and total gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant currency basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.U.S. gross bookings decreased by 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to declines in gross bookings by priceline.com's retail airline ticket service (due to lower airfares), Name Your Own Price® reservation services and vacation package reservation service, partially offset by increases in gross bookings by priceline.com's retail hotel and rental car reservation services and priceline.com's Express Deals® hotel reservation service. Travel service providers typically provide a limited amount of availability to opaque services like those of priceline.com, especially during periods of healthy travel demand. As a result, the recent healthy travel environment (which has had an adverse impact on our access to opaque availability) and the increased use by consumers of discounted closed user group prices for hotel rooms have negatively affected our opaque reservation services. 50Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 ChangeAgency$47,969 $42,892 11.8%Merchant7,559 7,409 2.0%Total$55,528 $50,300 10.4% Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we are the merchant of record. Agency gross bookings increased 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to growth in gross bookings from Booking.com agency accommodation room night reservations, as well as growth in gross bookings by priceline.com and rentalcars.com agency retail rental car reservation services, and priceline.com and agoda.com agency retail hotel reservation services, partially offset by lower retail airfares. Merchant gross bookings increased 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increases in gross bookings by merchant retail hotel reservation services for Booking.com and priceline.com, rentalcars.com's rental car reservation service, and priceline.com's Express Deals® hotel reservation service as well as the inclusion of our Rocketmiles hotel reservation service since its acquisition in February 2015. These increases were partially offset by declines in gross bookings by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services and the impact of the stronger U.S. Dollar on agoda.com's merchant retail hotel reservation service. The U.S. Dollar was significantly stronger against the Euro and many other currencies throughout 2015 compared to 2014, which significantly adversely affected the growth of our agency and merchant gross bookings, expressed in U.S. Dollars.Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 ChangeRoom Nights432.3 346.0 24.9 %Rental Car Days59.9 51.8 15.6 %Airline Tickets7.7 7.8 (1.6)% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 24.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in Booking.com, agoda.com and priceline.com accommodation room night reservations and the inclusion of Rocketmiles accommodation room night reservations since its acquisition in February 2015. Booking.com included over 850,000 properties on its website as of February 15, 2016, which included approximately 390,000 vacation rental properties (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website), compared to over 635,000 properties (including approximately 269,000 vacation rental properties) a year ago. In September 2015, Booking.com changed the way it calculates property counts. As a result, properties that are contracted with Booking.com but temporarily do not have availability on Booking.com (for example properties that are closed during their off-peak season or for renovations) will remain included in Booking.com's property counts during these temporary periods. Booking.com previously excluded properties that were temporarily unavailable for booking. We believe that continuously including them provides a more consistent and useful property count.Rental car day reservations increased by 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in price-disclosed rental car day reservations for rentalcars.com and priceline.com, partially offset by a decline in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® rental car day reservations.Airline ticket reservations decreased by 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to a decline in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservations. 51RevenuesWe classify our revenue into three categories: •Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the travel services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, GDS reservation booking fees related to certain travel services, travel insurance fees and customer processing fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Substantially all of the revenue for Booking.com is agency revenue comprised of travel commissions. •Merchant revenues are derived from services where we are the merchant of record and therefore charge the customer's credit card for the travel services provided. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction net revenues (i.e., to the extent applicable, the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged to us by travel service providers) in connection with (a) the accommodation reservations provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel reservation services at agoda.com, priceline.com and Booking.com and (b) the reservations provided through our merchant rental car service at rentalcars.com and Express Deals® reservation services at priceline.com; (2) transaction revenues representing the price of Name Your Own Price® hotel, rental car and airline ticket reservations and vacation packages charged to a customer (with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues); (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with (a) priceline.com's Express Deals® and Name Your Own Price® reservation services and (b) merchant retail hotel reservation services at priceline.com and agoda.com; and (4) ancillary fees, including damage excess waiver and travel insurance fees and GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. •Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (1) revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps; (2) revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) reservation fees (reservation fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service) and (b) subscription fees earned by OpenTable for restaurant reservation management services; (3) revenues earned by priceline.com for advertising on its websites; and (4) revenues generated by Booking.com's BookingSuite branded accommodation marketing and business analytics services. Revenue from KAYAK is net of intercompany revenues earned by KAYAK from other Priceline Group brands.

The U.S. Dollar was significantly stronger against the Euro and many other currencies throughout 2015 compared to 2014, which significantly adversely affected the growth of our agency revenues, expressed in U.S. Dollars.Merchant RevenuesMerchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 4.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to decreases in revenues from priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® hotel, airline ticket and rental car reservation services, partially offset by increases in our merchant price-disclosed hotel and rental car businesses. Our priceline.com Name Your Own Price® reservation services, which declined year-over-year, are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues. Our other merchant revenues, which in total grew year-over-year, are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs. As a result, changes in Name Your Own Price® reservation revenue disproportionately affect merchant revenues as compared to our other merchant revenues. We therefore 52believe that gross profit is an important measure of evaluating growth in our business. The U.S. Dollar was significantly stronger against the Euro and many other currencies throughout 2015 compared to 2014, which significantly adversely affected the growth of our merchant revenues, expressed in U.S. Dollars.Advertising and Other RevenuesAdvertising and other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of advertising revenues, restaurant reservation revenues and subscription revenues for restaurant reservation management services. Advertising and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased 49.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable revenues in 2015 compared to only a partial year's results in 2014, as well as growth in our KAYAK business. Cost of Revenues Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeCost of Revenues$632,180 $857,841 (26.3)% For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost paid to travel service providers for priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® and vacation package reservation services, net of applicable taxes and charges; and (2) fees paid to third parties by KAYAK and priceline.com to return travel itinerary information for consumer search queries. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by 26.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of revenue benefited from a reversal of previously accrued travel transaction taxes of $16.4 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to a favorable ruling in the State of Hawaii. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a net reduction in cost of revenue in the third quarter of 2015 of $13.7 million related to travel transaction taxes, principally due to a cash refund from the State of Hawaii for the aforementioned favorable ruling. Agency revenues have no cost of revenue. Agency revenues principally consist of travel commissions on accommodation reservations. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeGross Profit$8,591,807 $7,584,130 13.3%Gross Margin93.1% 89.8% Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 13.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 27%), primarily as a result of the increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in the year ended December 31, 2015 these revenues represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in the year ended December 31, 2014. Our price-disclosed reservation services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs, have been growing faster than priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure for evaluating growth in our business.Our international operations accounted for approximately $7.4 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased by 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 28%). Gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses increased 53by 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by the inclusion of OpenTable, which benefited year-over-year comparisons through the anniversary of the acquisition on July 24, 2015. In addition, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by a reversal of previously accrued travel transaction taxes of $16.4 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to a favorable ruling in the State of Hawaii. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was also positively impacted by a net reduction in cost of revenue in the third quarter of 2015 of $13.7 million related to travel transaction taxes, principally due to a cash refund from the State of Hawaii for the aforementioned favorable ruling.The U.S. Dollar was significantly stronger against the Euro and many other currencies throughout 2015 compared to 2014. At these exchange rates, the growth of our total and international gross bookings, expressed in U.S. Dollars, was significantly adversely impacted in 2015.Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeOnline Advertising$2,797,237 $2,360,221 18.5 %% of Total Gross Profit32.6% 31.1% Offline Advertising$214,685 $231,309 (7.2)%% of Total Gross Profit2.5% 3.0% Online advertising expenses consist primarily of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; and (4) banner, pop-up and other Internet and mobile advertisements. For the year ended December 31, 2015, online advertising expenses increased 18.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased spending on online performance marketing to generate increased gross bookings. Online advertising as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 benefited from the inclusion of OpenTable because OpenTable spends a lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising relative to our other brands. In addition, the share of our business coming directly to our websites with no associated online advertising expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. These favorable impacts were more than offset for the year ended December 31, 2015 by a year-over-year decline in advertising ROIs.Offline advertising expenses are primarily related to our Booking.com, KAYAK and priceline.com businesses and primarily consist of television advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2015, offline advertising decreased 7.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower spending at KAYAK and, to a lesser extent, priceline.com.Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeSales and Marketing$353,221 $310,910 13.6%% of Total Gross Profit4.1% 4.1% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) customer relations costs; (4) public relations costs; (5) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency accommodation commission receivables; and (6) provisions for credit card chargebacks. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to increased gross booking volumes, customer relations costs and the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable's results as compared to only a partial year's results in 2014. 54Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangePersonnel$1,166,226 $950,191 22.7%% of Total Gross Profit13.6% 12.5% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our businesses. Additionally, the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable's results in our 2015 consolidated results as compared to only a partial year's results in 2014 contributed to the increase in personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$415,420 $352,869 17.7%% of Total Gross Profit4.8% 4.7% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) personnel-related expenses such as travel, recruiting and training expenses; and (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to higher occupancy and office expenses related to the expansion of our international businesses and higher personnel-related expenses related to increased headcount in all of our businesses. Additionally, the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable's results in our 2015 consolidated results as compared to only a partial year's results in 2014 contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeInformation Technology$113,617 $97,498 16.5%% of Total Gross Profit1.3% 1.3% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; (3) outsourced data center costs; and (4) payments to outside consultants. Information technology expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations. Additionally, the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable's results in our 2015 consolidated results as compared to only a partial year's results in 2014 contributed to the increase in information technology expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. 55Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$272,494 $207,820 31.1%% of Total Gross Profit3.2% 2.7% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) depreciation of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2015, depreciation and amortization expense increased, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to increased intangible amortization from the OpenTable acquisition and increased depreciation expense due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com business. Additionally, the inclusion of OpenTable in our consolidated results since its acquisition on July 24, 2014 contributed to the increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeInterest Income$55,729 $13,933 300.0%Interest Expense(160,229) (88,353) 81.4%Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(26,087) (9,444) 176.2%Total$(130,587) $(83,864) 55.7% For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance and higher yields. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to interest expense attributable to our Senior Notes issued in August 2014, September 2014, March 2015 and November 2015, partially offset by the maturity of our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes in March 2015. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange losses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to foreign exchange gains of $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, resulted in losses of $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which includes approximately $5.7 million of hedging cost and a foreign exchange loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, compared to foreign exchange losses of $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $2.2 million of net realized gains related to investments, which are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The conversion of our convertible debt prior to maturity in the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in non-cash losses of $6.3 million, which are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 56Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$576,960 $567,695 1.6% Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 18.4% and 19.0%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to lower tax rates outside the United States, partially offset by U.S. state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. Our effective tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increased proportion of our income being taxed at lower international tax rates. According to Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 5% (""Innovation Box Tax"") rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on the Company's effective tax rate for those periods. While we expect Booking.com to continue to qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatment with respect to a portion of its earnings for the foreseeable future, the loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit, whether due to a change in tax law or a determination by the Dutch government that Booking.com's activities are not ""innovative"" or for any other reason, would substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations.Until our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire, most of our U.S. income will not be subject to a cash tax liability, other than federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes. However, we expect to pay foreign taxes on our international income except in countries where we have operating loss carryforwards. We expect that our international operations will grow their pretax income faster than the U.S. business over the long term and, therefore, it is our expectation that our cash tax payments will increase as our international businesses generate an increasing share of our pretax income. We will be subject to increased income taxes in the event that our cash balances held outside the United States are remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we held approximately $9.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments outside of the United States. We currently intend to use our cash held outside the United States to reinvest in our international operations. If our cash balances outside the United States continue to grow and our ability to reinvest those balances outside the United States diminishes, under U.S. GAAP we will be obligated to record additional income tax expense in the United States with respect to our unremitted international earnings. We would not make additional income tax payments unless we were to actually repatriate our international cash to the United States. We would pay only U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and certain U.S. state income taxes as long as we have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset our U.S. taxable income. This could result in us being subject to a cash income tax liability on the earnings of our U.S. businesses sooner than would otherwise have been the case. 57Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2014 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Operating and Statistical Metrics Gross bookings resulting from accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our international and U.S. operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 ChangeInternational$43,639 $33,300 31.0%U.S.6,661 5,873 13.4%Total$50,300 $39,173 28.4% Gross bookings increased by 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 (growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 30%), principally due to growth of 27.9% in accommodation room night reservations, 3% growth on a constant currency basis in ADRs, growth of 18.1% in rental car day reservations and 12.0% growth in airline ticket reservations. International gross bookings grew by 31.0% (growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 33%) for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of growth in accommodation room night reservations for our Booking.com and agoda.com businesses, as well as growth in rental car day reservations for our rentalcars.com business. The U.S. Dollar significantly strengthened against the Euro during 2014, moving from an exchange rate of 1.38 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 1, 2014 to 1.21 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of December 31, 2014. The U.S. Dollar has also strengthened against many other currencies since January 1, 2014. We therefore believe that unit growth rates and total gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant currency basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business. U.S. gross bookings increased by 13.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increases in priceline.com's retail airline ticket, retail hotel, Express Deals® hotel and retail rental car services, partially offset by declines in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Travel service providers typically provide a limited amount of availability to opaque services like ours, especially during periods of healthy travel demand. As a result, the recent healthy travel environment in the United States has had an adverse impact on our access to availability for our opaque reservation services.Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 ChangeAgency$42,892 $32,672 31.3%Merchant7,409 6,501 14.0%Total$50,300 $39,173 28.4% Agency gross bookings increased 31.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to growth in Booking.com accommodation room night reservations, priceline.com's retail airline ticket, rental car and hotel reservation services, and rentalcars.com rental car reservation service. Merchant gross bookings increased 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increases in agoda.com hotel reservation services, rentalcars.com rental car reservation services and priceline.com Express Deals® hotel and retail hotel reservation services, partially offset by declines in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® services. 58Units sold for accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 ChangeRoom Nights346.0 270.5 27.9%Rental Car Days51.8 43.9 18.1%Airline Tickets7.8 7.0 12.0% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 27.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to an increase in Booking.com, agoda.com and priceline.com accommodation room night reservations. Booking.com, our most significant brand, included over 600,000 properties on its website as of February 13, 2015, which included over 245,000 vacation rental properties, compared to approximately 425,000 properties as of February 18, 2014, which included over 110,000 vacation rental properties (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Booking.com has added properties over the past year in its core European market as well as higher-growth markets such as North America (which is a newer market for Booking.com), Asia-Pacific and South America. An increasing amount of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in our newer markets which are growing faster than our overall growth rate and our core European market.Rental car day reservations increased by 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to an increase in price-disclosed rental car day reservations for rentalcars.com and priceline.com, partially offset by a decline in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® rental car reservation service.Airline ticket reservations increased by 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to an increase in price-disclosed airline ticket reservations for priceline.com driven primarily by increased paid advertising placements on KAYAK (which began in the third quarter of 2013), partially offset by a decline in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservation service. Revenues Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeAgency Revenues$5,845,802 $4,410,689 32.5 %Merchant Revenues2,186,054 2,211,474 (1.1)%Advertising and Other Revenues410,115 171,143 139.6 %Total Revenues$8,441,971 $6,793,306 24.3 % Agency RevenuesAgency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased 32.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of growth in the business of Booking.com. Our priceline.com agency revenues benefited from growth in our retail rental car, agency airline ticket and agency hotel reservation businesses.Merchant RevenuesMerchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased 1.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to decreases in revenues from priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services, mostly offset by increases in our agoda.com business, rentalcars.com business, priceline.com's Express Deals® and retail merchant hotel reservation services and priceline.com's Express Deals® rental car reservation services. Merchant revenue declined versus the prior year despite growth in merchant gross bookings, because our merchant revenues are disproportionately affected by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® service. Name Your Own Price® revenues, which declined year-over-year, are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and represented a smaller percentage, year-over-year, of total revenues compared to our faster-growing agoda.com, rentalcars.com and priceline.com retail merchant 59hotel and Express Deals® reservation services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business.Advertising and Other RevenuesAdvertising and other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of advertising revenues, restaurant reservation revenues and subscription revenues for restaurant reservation management services. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes $100.6 million of OpenTable revenue earned since its acquisition on July 24, 2014. Cost of Revenues Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeCost of Revenues$857,841 $1,077,420 (20.4)% Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2014, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost paid to travel service providers for priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services, net of applicable taxes and charges; (2) fees paid to third parties by KAYAK and priceline.com to return travel itinerary information in response to search queries; and (3) costs related to accruals for travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by 20.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a decrease in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes an accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2013 of approximately $20.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia, partially offset by a reduction in our accrual related to travel transaction taxes of $6.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013, principally related to a favorable agreement and ruling in the District of Columbia.Agency revenues have no cost of revenue. Agency revenues principally consist of travel commissions on accommodation reservations. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeGross Profit$7,584,130 $5,715,886 32.7%Gross Margin89.8% 84.1% Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 32.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 (growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 34%), primarily as a result of the increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in the year ended December 31, 2014 these revenues represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in the year ended December 31, 2013. Our retail and semi-opaque reservation services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel provider cost have been growing faster than priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $6.6 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014, which compares to $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a constant currency basis, by approximately 34% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses increased by approximately 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was positively impacted by the inclusion of OpenTable and KAYAK since their acquisitions on July 24, 2014 and May 21, 2013, respectively. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 60negatively impacted by an accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2013 of approximately $20.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) for travel transaction taxes, principally related to unfavorable rulings in the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia, partially offset by a credit in the fourth quarter of 2013 of $6.3 million, principally related to a favorable agreement and ruling in the District of Columbia. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeOnline Advertising$2,360,221 $1,798,645 31.2%% of Total Gross Profit31.1% 31.5% Offline Advertising$231,309 $127,459 81.5%% of Total Gross Profit3.0% 2.2% Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; and (4) banner, pop-up and other Internet and mobile advertisements. For the year ended December 31, 2014, online advertising expenses increased 31.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily to generate increased gross bookings. Online advertising as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from the inclusion of KAYAK and OpenTable because they spend a lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brands. Also, our consolidated results exclude intercompany advertising by our brands on KAYAK since the acquisition on May 21, 2013. In addition, the share of our business coming directly to our websites with no associated online advertising expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2014. These favorable impacts were almost entirely offset for the year ended December 31, 2014 by (1) a year-over-year decline in advertising ROIs and (2) brand mix within The Priceline Group as Booking.com, agoda.com and rentalcars.com grew faster than priceline.com and typically spend a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising. Offline advertising expenses are primarily related to our Booking.com, KAYAK and priceline.com businesses and primarily consist of television advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2014, offline advertising increased 81.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the launch of offline advertising campaigns by Booking.com in Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada in 2014 and Australia in the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as incremental offline advertising by KAYAK. Offline advertising growth for the year ended December 31, 2014 was also impacted by the inclusion of KAYAK in our consolidated results since its acquisition on May 21, 2013.Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeSales and Marketing$310,910 $235,817 31.8%% of Total Gross Profit4.1% 4.1% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency accommodation commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2014, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes, higher public relations costs and the inclusion of OpenTable since its acquisition on July 24, 2014. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of gross profit are typically higher for our merchant businesses, which incur credit card processing fees. Our merchant business grew more slowly than our agency business, and as a result, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 were favorably impacted compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This impact was offset during the year ended December 31, 2014 by the inclusion of OpenTable in our consolidated results since its acquisition on July 24, 2014 because OpenTable spends a higher percentage of gross profit on sales and marketing than our agency businesses. 61Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangePersonnel$950,191 $698,692 36.0%% of Total Gross Profit12.5% 12.2% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our businesses. The inclusion of OpenTable and KAYAK in our consolidated results since their acquisitions on July 24, 2014 and May 21, 2013, respectively, contributed to this increase in personnel expenses. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $140.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 includes charges amounting to $20.6 million and $24.1 million, respectively, representing the impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for outstanding unvested performance share units. Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 also includes $26.5 million of compensation expense related to 2014 acquisitions.In December 2013, the Dutch Government enacted certain amendments to Dutch tax law including a one-time irrevocable levy on an employer applied to employee earnings, equal to 16% of an employee's earnings in excess of 150,000 Euros. This levy resulted in additional payroll taxes recorded in personnel expense of approximately $12 million (approximately $9 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2013. There was no similar tax levy in 2014.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$352,869 $252,994 39.5%% of Total Gross Profit4.7% 4.4% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) personnel related expenses such as travel, recruiting and training expenses; and (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to higher occupancy and office expenses related to the expansion of our international businesses and higher personnel related expenses related to increased headcount in all of our businesses. The inclusion of OpenTable and KAYAK in our consolidated results since their acquisitions on July 24, 2014 and May 21, 2013, respectively, contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 included approximately $6.9 million of professional fees related to consummated acquisitions. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 included approximately $8.5 million of professional fees related to the acquisition of KAYAK. 62Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeInformation Technology$97,498 $71,890 35.6%% of Total Gross Profit1.3% 1.3% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; (3) outsourced data center costs; and (4) payments to outside consultants. Information technology expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations. The inclusion of OpenTable and KAYAK in our consolidated results since their acquisitions on July 24, 2014 and May 21, 2013, respectively, contributed to the increase in information technology expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$207,820 $117,975 76.2%% of Total Gross Profit2.7% 2.1% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) depreciation of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to increased intangible amortization from the OpenTable and KAYAK acquisitions and increased depreciation expense due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com business. Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeInterest Income$13,933 $4,167 234.4 %Interest Expense(88,353) (83,289) 6.1 %Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(9,444) (36,755) (74.3)%Total$(83,864) $(115,877) (27.6)% For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance and higher yields. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to interest expense attributable to our Senior Notes issued in August 2014 and September 2014 and interest expense attributable to our Senior Convertible Notes issued in May 2013, partially offset by early conversions of our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2015. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange gains of $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with foreign exchange gains of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 63Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, of $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to foreign exchange transaction losses of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we delivered cash of $122.9 million to repay the aggregate principal amount and issued 300,256 shares of our common stock and paid cash of $2.2 million in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount associated with our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2015 that were converted prior to maturity. The conversion of our convertible debt prior to maturity resulted in a non-cash loss of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a non-cash loss of $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which is recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$567,695 $403,739 40.6% Our effective tax rates, expressed as income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 19.0% and 17.6%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to lower tax rates outside the United States, partially offset by U.S. state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. Our effective tax rate was higher for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the acquisitions of OpenTable on July 24, 2014 and KAYAK on May 21, 2013, both of which are principally taxed at the higher U.S. tax rates.According to Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 5% (""Innovation Box Tax"") rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on the Company's effective tax rate for those periods. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 ChangeNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests$— $135 NA We purchased the remaining outstanding shares underlying the redeemable noncontrolling interests in April 2013. 64Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2015, we had $10.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments. Approximately $9.8 billion is held by our international subsidiaries and is denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, Euros and, to a lesser extent, British Pounds Sterling and other currencies. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the United States. If we repatriate cash to the United States, we would utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and beyond that amount incur additional tax payments in the United States. Cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments are comprised of U.S. and foreign corporate bonds, U.S. and foreign government securities, high-grade commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, Ctrip American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") and bank deposits. On May 26, 2015, we invested $250 million in five-year senior convertible notes issued at par by Ctrip.com International Ltd. (""Ctrip""). On December 11, 2015, we invested $500 million in a ten-year senior convertible note issued at par value by Ctrip. During 2015, we invested an additional $208.4 million in Ctrip ADSs. In June 2015, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.50%; or the greatest of (a) Bank of America, N.A.'s prime lending rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (c) an adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.085% to 0.20%.The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $70.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $50.0 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding and approximately $2.5 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 2,539,921 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $3.1 billion. As of December 31, 2015, there was no remaining authorization from our Board of Directors to purchase our common stock.In the first quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program allowing us to purchase of up to $3.0 billion of our common stock. We may from time to time make repurchases of our common stock, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. We expect to use cash on hand and generated by our operations in the United States to fund our share repurchases. We may also utilize our revolving credit facility or raise funds through the debt capital markets to fund share repurchases. In September 2015, we paid $18.4 million to settle a contingent liability related to an acquisition. The portion of the payment related to the acquisition-date estimated fair value of $10.7 million is shown as a financing activity and the remaining portion of the payment for $7.7 million, which was charged to general and administrative expenses as a fair value adjustment, is included as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.In March 2015, we issued Senior Notes due 2027 for an aggregate principal amount of 1.0 billion Euros, with an interest rate of 1.8%. Interest on the notes is payable annually on March 3, beginning March 3, 2016. In addition, in March 2015, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2025, with an interest rate of 3.65%. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, beginning September 15, 2015. In November 2015, we issued Senior Notes due 2022 for an aggregate principal amount of 750 million Euros, with an interest rate of 2.15%. Interest on the 2022 Notes is payable annually on November 25, beginning November 25, 2016. The net proceeds of these notes were used for general corporate purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these notes.In March 2015, in connection with the maturity or conversion prior to maturity of the remaining outstanding 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due March 15, 2015, we paid $37.5 million to satisfy the aggregate principal amount due and paid an additional $110.1 million in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount.Our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from consumers and then we pay most of our travel service providers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in accounts receivable, 65deferred merchant bookings and travel service provider payables seasonally depending on the absolute level of our merchant transactions during the last few weeks of every quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $3.1 billion, resulting from net income of $2.6 billion and a favorable impact of $558.9 million for non-cash items not affecting cash flows, partially offset by net unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $8.0 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2015, were primarily related to a $166.2 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $68.7 million increase in accounts receivable and $81.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and deferred income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $2.9 billion, resulting from net income of $2.4 billion and a favorable impact of non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $518.0 million, slightly offset by net unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $25.4 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2014, were primarily related to a $203.9 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $182.2 million increase in accounts receivable and $48.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and deferred income taxes.Net cash used in investing activities was $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 were affected by net purchases of investments of $3.6 billion, $140.3 million used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by net proceeds of $5.2 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were affected by payments of $2.5 billion for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and net cash payments of $80.3 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts slightly offset by net sales of investments of $350.3 million and a change in restricted cash of $9.3 million. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment was $173.9 million and $131.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in 2015 was related to additional data center capacity and new offices to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com business.Net cash used in financing activities was $730.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of treasury stock purchases of $3.1 billion, payments of $147.6 million related to the conversion of Senior Notes and payment of $10.7 million related to the settlement of the acquisition-date estimated contingent liability related to an acquisition, primarily offset by the total proceeds of $2.4 billion from the issuance of Senior Notes, excess tax benefits on stock-based awards of $101.5 million and the exercise of employee stock options of $20.9 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily consisted of total proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of Convertible Senior Notes and Euro denominated Senior Notes, excess tax benefits on stock-based awards of $23.4 million and the exercise of employee stock options of $16.4 million, partially offset by treasury stock purchases of $750.4 million and payments of $125.1 million related to the conversion of Senior Notes.ContingenciesFrench tax authorities recently concluded an audit that started in 2013 of the years 2003 through 2012 to determine whether Booking.com is in compliance with its tax obligations in France, and Booking.com received a formal assessment in December 2015. While we believe that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with French tax law, as a result of the audit the French tax authorities claim that Booking.com has a permanent establishment in France and seek to recover unpaid income taxes and VAT of approximately 356 million Euros, the majority of which would represent penalties and interest. We intend to contest any such assessment. If we are unable to resolve the matter with the French authorities, we would expect to challenge the assessment in the French courts. In order to contest the assessment in court, we may be required to pay, upfront, the full amount or a significant part of any such assessment, though any such payment would not constitute an admission by us that we owe the taxes. French authorities may decide to also audit subsequent tax years, which could result in additional assessments. See Part I Item IA Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""A number of U.S. jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against online travel companies, including us, related to, among other things, the payment of travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). In addition, a number of U.S. states, counties and municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started 66inquiries relating to the payment of travel transaction taxes. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Adverse application of state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations"" in this Annual Report.As a result of this litigation and other attempts by U.S. jurisdictions to levy similar taxes, we have established an accrual (including estimated interest and penalties) for the potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes in the amount of approximately $27 million at December 31, 2015 compared to approximately $52 million at December 31, 2014. A March 2015 ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court significantly reduced our (and other OTCs') liability and as a result we reduced our accrual for travel transaction taxes (including estimated interest and penalties) by $16.4 million with a corresponding reduction to cost of revenues in the first quarter of 2015. The accrual is based on our estimate of the probable cost of resolving these issues. Our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued. The actual cost may be less or greater, potentially significantly, than the liabilities recorded. An estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued cannot be reasonably made. If we were to suffer adverse determinations in the near term in more of the pending proceedings than currently anticipated given results to date, because of our available cash we believe that it would not have a material impact on our liquidity.The following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands)Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations $465,528 $92,552 $151,874 $114,243 $106,859Senior Notes(1) 7,347,065 103,658 1,202,315 1,185,565 4,855,527Revolving credit facility(2) 11,926 3,146 5,049 3,731 —Earnout - acquisition 9,170 — — 9,170 —Total(3) $7,833,689 $199,356 $1,359,238 $1,312,709 $4,962,386(1)Represents the aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and cumulative interest to maturity of $858 million. Convertible debt does not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or shares of common stock at our option. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Represents fees on uncommitted funds and outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2015.(3)We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $135 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015, of which approximately $43 million related to deferred rents, approximately $42 million related to unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and approximately $27 million related to our accrual for the potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for the liabilities related to travel transaction taxes and unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Therefore, we have excluded long-term liabilities of $126 million from the contractual obligations table above because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments or the liability related to deferred rents, which represents the difference in rent expense recognized in the income statements and rent payments related to operating leases. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. 67Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2015. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2015, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future.Fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our available-for-sale investments assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments as of December 31, 2015 of approximately $135.1 million. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity.As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was approximately $6.5 billion. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2015. A substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount is related to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible notes.We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euros). As a result, we face exposures to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the operating results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, result in gains and losses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The U.S. Dollar significantly strengthened against the Euro during 2014, moving from an exchange rate of 1.38 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of January 1, 2014 to 1.21 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of December 31, 2014. The U.S. Dollar has strengthened further in 2015 to an exchange rate of 1.09 U.S. Dollars per Euro as of December 31, 2015. The U.S. Dollar also strengthened significantly during this time frame as compared to many other currencies. As a result, our foreign currency denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses and net income have been negatively impacted as expressed in U.S. Dollars. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. The aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes, and accrued interest thereon, provide a natural hedge of the net assets of certain of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries.From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations in our consolidated operating results. Our derivative contracts principally address foreign exchange 68fluctuation risk for the Euro and the British Pound Sterling versus the U.S. Dollar. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no such outstanding derivative contracts. Foreign exchange losses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and foreign exchange gains of $13.7 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.",2023-12-30 18:44:28.379283
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2017,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include those discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.OverviewOur mission is to help people experience the world. We seek to achieve our mission by providing consumers, travel service providers and restaurants with worldwide leadership in online reservation and related services. We operate six primary, independently managed brands: •Booking.com - the world’s leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations, based on room nights booked.•priceline.com - a leading hotel, rental car, airline ticket and vacation package reservation service in the United States.•KAYAK - a leading meta-search service allowing consumers to easily search and compare travel itineraries and prices, including airline ticket, accommodation and rental car reservation information.•agoda.com - a leading accommodation reservation service catering primarily to consumers in the Asia-Pacific region.•Rentalcars.com - a leading worldwide rental car reservation service.•OpenTable - a leading provider of restaurant reservation and information services to consumers and restaurant reservation management services to restaurants.We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands collectively as ""The Priceline Group,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us.""Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda.com and Rentalcars.com and the international businesses of KAYAK and OpenTable (in each case regardless of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant). During the year ended December 31, 2016, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 88% of our consolidated gross profit. A significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.We derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following sources:•Commissions earned from facilitating reservations of accommodations, rental cars, cruises and other travel services on an agency basis;•Transaction gross profit on a merchant basis and customer processing fees from our accommodation, rental car, airline ticket and vacation package reservation services;•Advertising revenues primarily earned by KAYAK from sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers, as well as from advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps;•Beginning on July 24, 2014, reservation revenues paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation services, subscription fees for restaurant reservation management services provided by OpenTable and other OpenTable revenues; and•Damage excess waiver fees, travel insurance fees and global distribution system (""GDS"") reservation booking fees, in each case related to certain of our travel services. 34Our priceline.com brand offers merchant Name Your Own Price® opaque travel services, which are recorded in revenue on a ""gross"" basis and have associated cost of revenue. All of our other services are recorded in revenue on a ""net"" basis and have no associated cost of revenue. Therefore, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of our revenues between Name Your Own Price® travel services and other services. Gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for all of our services. Consequently, gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business because, in contrast to our revenues, it is not affected by the different methods of recording revenue and cost of revenue between our Name Your Own Price® travel reservation services and our other services. TrendsOver the last several years we have experienced strong growth in our accommodation reservation services. We believe this growth is the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the widespread adoption of mobile devices, the high growth of travel overall in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and South America, and the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to build accommodation supply, content and distribution and to improve the consumer experience on our websites and mobile apps. These year-over-year growth rates have generally decelerated. Given the size of our accommodation reservation business, we expect that our year-over-year growth rates will generally continue to decelerate, though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate and there may be periods of acceleration from time to time. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2016, our accommodation room night reservation growth was 29%, as compared to 25% in 2015, 28% in 2014, 37% in 2013 and 40% in 2012. Our international business represents the substantial majority of our financial results, and we expect our operating results and other financial metrics to continue to be largely driven by international performance. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet use and e-commerce activity of international consumers have trailed that of consumers in the United States. However, international consumers are increasingly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. We expect that over the long term, international online travel growth rates will follow a similar trend to that experienced in the United States. In addition, the base of hotel properties in Europe and Asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the leading online accommodation reservation service provider in the world as measured by room nights booked. We believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the markets in which we operate.Our growth has primarily been generated by our worldwide accommodation reservation service brand, Booking.com, which is our most significant brand, and has been due, in part, to the availability of a large and growing number of directly bookable properties through Booking.com. Booking.com included over 1,115,000 properties on its website as of December 31, 2016, which included over 568,000 vacation rental properties (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website), and compares to over 852,000 properties (including over 390,000 vacation rental properties) as of December 31, 2015. We intend to continue to invest in adding accommodations available for reservation on our websites, including hotels, bed and breakfasts, hostels and vacation rentals. Vacation rentals generally consist of, among others, properties categorized as single-unit and multi-unit villas, apartments, ""aparthotels"" (which are apartments with a front desk and cleaning service) and chalets and are generally self-catered (i.e., include a kitchen), directly bookable properties. Many of the newer accommodations we add to our travel reservation services, especially in highly penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms or higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of consumers (e.g., hostels and bed and breakfasts). Because a vacation rental is typically either a single unit or a small collection of independent units, vacation rental accommodations represent more limited booking opportunities than non-vacation rental properties, which generally have more units to rent per property. Our vacation rental accommodations in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism seasons, weather or other factors. Our vacation rental accommodation business may also experience lower profit margins due to certain additional costs related to offering these accommodations on our websites. As we increase our vacation rental accommodation business, these different characteristics could negatively impact our profit margins; and, to the extent these properties represent an increasing percentage of the properties added to our websites, we expect that our gross bookings growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time (since each such property has fewer booking opportunities). As a result of the foregoing, as the percentage of vacation rental properties increases, we expect that the number of reservations per property will likely continue to decrease. We believe that continuing to expand the number and variety of accommodations available through our services, in particular Booking.com, will help us to continue to grow our accommodation reservation business. 35As part of our strategy to increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com, Booking.com is increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis where it facilitates payments on behalf of customers. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for properties that do not accept credit cards and to increase its ability to offer flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. Although we will incur additional payment processing costs and chargebacks related to these transactions, which are recorded as sales and marketing expenses in our statement of operations and which will negatively impact our operating margins, we believe that adding these types of properties and service offerings will benefit our customers and our gross bookings, room night and earnings growth rates.Concerns persist about the outlook for the global economy in general, including uncertainty in the European Union and China. Perceived or actual adverse economic conditions, including slow, slowing or negative economic growth, unemployment rates and weakening currencies and concerns over government responses such as higher taxes and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. Further, uncertainty regarding the future of the European Union following the United Kingdom’s vote to leave (“Brexit”) and concerns regarding certain E.U. members with sovereign debt default risks could also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. At times, we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates, increased cancellation rates and weaker trends in hotel ADRs across many regions of the world, particularly in those countries that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainties, which we believe are due at least in part to macro-economic conditions and concerns. For more detail, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""These and other macro-economic uncertainties, such as sovereign default risk becoming more widespread, declining oil prices, geopolitical tensions and differing central bank monetary policies, have led to significant volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and other currencies. Significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, stock markets and oil prices can also impact consumer travel behavior. As noted earlier, our international business represents a substantial majority of our financial results. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international businesses are translated from local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. Throughout 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened significantly year-over-year relative to substantially all currencies in which we transact, most notably the Euro, Brazilian Real, British Pound Sterling, Russian Ruble and Australian Dollar. In 2016, the U.S. Dollar continued to be stronger year-over-year relative to the British Pound Sterling, Russian Ruble and many other major currencies in which we transact. Since the ""Brexit"" referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016, the U.S. Dollar has strengthened significantly against the British Pound Sterling. As a result of these currency exchange rate changes, our foreign currency denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses and net income have been negatively impacted as expressed in U.S. Dollars, although to a much lesser extent in 2016 than in 2015. For example, gross profit from our international operations grew 22.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, but, without the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates, grew year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 25%. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. The aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes, and accrued interest thereon, provide a natural hedge of the net assets of certain of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries. For more information, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.""We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated operating results into U.S. Dollars. However, such derivative instruments are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuations that could impact growth rates for our gross bookings, revenues or gross profit (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts).We compete globally with both online and traditional providers of travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Amazon and Facebook, have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market, including by establishing a flight meta-search product (“Google Flights”) and a hotel meta-search business (""Hotel Ads"") that are growing rapidly, as well as its ""Book on Google"" reservation functionality. Our markets are also subject to rapidly changing conditions, including technological developments, consumer behavior changes, regulatory changes and travel service provider consolidation. We expect these trends to continue. For example, we have experienced a significant shift of both direct and indirect business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Advertising and distribution 36opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes. In addition, the gross profit earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance. For more detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face, see Part I Item 1 Business - ""Competition"", Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance."" and ""Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates new challenges and may enable device companies such as Apple to compete directly with us."" and ""We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological changes.""We have observed an increase in promotional pricing to closed user groups (such as loyalty program participants or consumers with registered accounts), including through mobile apps. For example, Marriott International, Hilton, Hyatt Hotels, InterContinental Hotel Group and Choice Hotels International have launched additional initiatives to encourage consumers to book accommodations directly through their websites, with increased discounting and incentives.In addition to providing retail travel reservation services, our priceline.com brand is a leading provider of discounted opaque travel reservation services in the United States through its Name Your Own Price® and Express Deals® offerings. These discounted services are referred to as ""opaque"" because certain elements of the reservation, including the name of the travel service provider, are not made known to the traveler until after the reservation is made. In general, we expect that over time our opaque services will continue to decrease in relative importance to our overall business due, we believe, to a variety of factors, including the growth rates of our retail businesses, competition, relative complexity, travel restrictions often required by the travel service provider, difficulty in offering these services on mobile devices, increased discounts available to consumers through closed user groups, and limited availability of discounted travel reservations from travel service providers, particularly during periods of high consumer demand.We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Both our performance and brand advertising expenses have increased significantly in recent years, a trend we expect to continue. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our total performance advertising expense was approximately $3.5 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our websites. We also invested approximately $296 million, $274 million and $257 million in brand advertising during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing television advertising, online video advertising (for example, on YouTube and Facebook) and online display advertising. We intend to continue a strategy of promoting brand awareness through both online and offline advertising efforts, including by expanding brand campaigns into additional markets. We have observed increased brand advertising by OTCs, meta-search services and travel service providers, particularly in North America and Europe, which may make our brand advertising efforts more expensive and less effective.Performance advertising efficiency, expressed as performance advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit, is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are, in some cases, outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers and the extent to which consumers come directly to our websites or mobile apps for bookings. For example, competition for desired rankings in search results and/or a decline in ad clicks by consumers could increase our costs-per-click and reduce our performance advertising efficiency. We have also experienced increasing cancellation rates, which we expect to continue and which negatively affects our advertising efficiency and results of operations. Changes by Google in how it presents travel search results, including by placing its own offerings at or near the top of search results, or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites. We have observed a long-term trend of decreasing performance advertising returns on investment (""ROIs""), a trend we expect to continue, though the rate of decrease may fluctuate and there may be periods of stable or increasing ROIs from time to time. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We rely on performance and brand advertising channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites and grow our business."" and ""Our business could be negatively affected by changes in Internet search engine algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.""The national competition authorities (""NCAs"") of many governments have conducted or are conducting investigations into competitive practices within the online travel industry, and we may be involved or affected by such investigations and their results. Some countries have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practices within the online travel industry. For example, in August 2015, France adopted legislation known as the ""Macron Law"" making price parity agreements illegal, including those that had been approved by the French NCA, and similar legislation may be enacted in other counties. For more information on these investigations and their potential effects on our business, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""As the size of our business grows, we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti-trust and competition regulators."" 37SeasonalityA meaningful amount of our gross bookings are generated early in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. However, we generally do not recognize revenue from these bookings until the travel occurs, which can be in a quarter other than when the reservation is booked. In contrast, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as the expense is incurred, which, in the case of performance advertising in particular, is typically in the quarter in which associated reservations are booked. As a result of this potential timing difference between when we record advertising expense and when we recognize associated revenue, we have historically experienced our highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of accommodation checkouts for the year for our European and North American businesses. The first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience volatility in earnings growth rates due to these seasonal timing factors. For our Asia-Pacific business, we experience the highest levels of accommodation bookings in the third and fourth quarters of the year, and the highest levels of travel consumption in the fourth quarter. As the relative growth rates for these businesses fluctuate, the quarterly distribution of our operating results may vary.In addition, the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results. For example, in 2016, our first quarter year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were positively impacted by Easter falling in the first quarter instead of the second quarter, as it did in 2015. Conversely, our second quarter 2016 year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were adversely impacted by Easter falling in the first quarter instead of the second quarter, as it did in 2015. Similarly to 2015, in 2017 Easter will fall in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, and will therefore have a negative effect on our first quarter 2017 year-over-year growth rates and a positive effect on our second quarter 2017 year-over-year growth rates as compared to the same periods in 2016 when Easter fell in the first quarter. The timing of other holidays such as Chinese New Year, Carnival and Ramadan can also impact our quarterly year-over-year growth rates.The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business. For example, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable advertising expense. In addition, gross profit growth is typically less impacted by decelerating gross bookings growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters. Conversely, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate accelerates, our operating margins are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable advertising expense. In addition, gross profit growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters.Other FactorsWe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel and travel-related services. Factors beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, droughts and volcanic eruptions, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Zika, Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu, SARS and MERS, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities or travel-related accidents, can disrupt travel or otherwise result in declines in travel demand. Because these events or concerns are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services, which can adversely affect our business and results of operations. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - “Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.”We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. We have experienced pressure on operating margins as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain and highly competitive environment in which we operate makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated 38Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:•Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient's service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance ""contingency"") which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes charges amounting to $20.7 million, $22.6 million and $20.6 million, respectively, representing the impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share units. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we periodically review actual forfeitures and update our estimates for future forfeitures, if necessary. To the extent that actual forfeiture rates differ from current estimates, a cumulative expense adjustment is recorded in the period in which the estimate is revised (see ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting changes that are effective January 1, 2017).•Valuation of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair value are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable and, when we deem appropriate, include assistance from a third party valuation firm. The purchase price consideration is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price consideration over the net of the amounts allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date.We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. A substantial portion of our intangibles and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable in July 2014 and KAYAK in May 2013. As of September 30, 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing. Other than OpenTable, the fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values. For OpenTable, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill of $940.7 million, which is not tax deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of OpenTable goodwill of $580.1 million as of September 30, 2016. The goodwill impairment charge was included in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. OpenTable’s estimated fair value was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approaches (EBITDA multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies and precedent transactions). Since the annual impairment test as of September 30, 2016, there have been no further events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment. The goodwill impairment is primarily the result of a change in OpenTable’s business strategy that occurred during the third quarter of 2016. OpenTable’s post-acquisition strategy was premised on significant and rapid investment in international expansion and various other growth initiatives, resulting in near-term reduced earnings and profit margins but with the goal of achieving significantly increased revenues and profitability 39in the long term. This strategy has resulted in limited progress to date. As a result, while OpenTable intends to continue to pursue and invest in international expansion and its other growth initiatives, it intends to do so in a more measured and deliberate manner. This change in strategy resulted in OpenTable updating its forecasted financial results to reflect (a) a material reduction in forecasted long-term financial results from these initiatives, partially offset by (b) improved earnings and profit margins in the near term as a result of the reduced investments. Based on the updated forecast, we estimated a significant reduction in the fair value of the OpenTable business and recorded the goodwill impairment discussed above. Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to again re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in the updated forecast, including key assumptions regarding OpenTable's expected growth rates and operating margins and the success and timing of its international expansion and other growth initiatives, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates, currency exchange rates, market EBITDA comparables, and changes in accounting policies or practices, including the January 2017 accounting update that changes the goodwill impairment testing methodology (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If OpenTable does not achieve the results currently expected, its investments, in particular its investments in its international expansion efforts and other growth initiatives, are not successful, or any of the assumptions underlying our estimate of the value of the OpenTable business, including those mentioned above, prove to be incorrect, we may further refine our forecast for the OpenTable business and recognize an additional goodwill impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may not be recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset's future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value represents the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. We tested the recoverability of OpenTable’s other long-lived assets and concluded there was no impairment as of September 30, 2016. •Income Taxes. We determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. To date, we have been audited in several taxing jurisdictions with no significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more likely than not outcomes or we may adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. We intend to indefinitely reinvest the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries outside of the United States. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had approximately $13.0 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively, of cumulative unremitted international earnings. We estimate that the deferred tax liability we would record if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested internationally is approximately $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2016.Recent Accounting Pronouncements - See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details, which is incorporated into this Item 7 by reference thereto. 40Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-related services. Specifically, reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked through our OTC brands by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through our OTC brands by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. Our non-OTC brands (KAYAK and OpenTable) have different business metrics from those of our OTC brands and therefore search queries through KAYAK and restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not contribute to our gross bookings. Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 ChangeAgency$58,638 $47,969 22.2%Merchant9,449 7,559 25.0%Total$68,087 $55,528 22.6% Gross bookings increased by 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 25%), principally due to growth of 28.7% in accommodation room night reservations and growth of 11.2% in rental car day reservations, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, a slight decrease in accommodation ADRs (the decline on a constant-currency basis was less than 1%) and decreases in airfares and airline ticket reservations. We believe that unit growth rates and total gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant-currency basis, each of which exclude the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Agency gross bookings increased by 22.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to growth in gross bookings from Booking.com agency retail accommodation room night reservations.Merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Merchant gross bookings increased by 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to growth in gross bookings from the merchant accommodation reservation services for Booking.com and agoda.com, the merchant rental car reservation service for Rentalcars.com and the merchant airline ticket reservation service for priceline.com.Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 ChangeRoom Nights556.6 432.3 28.7 %Rental Car Days66.6 59.9 11.2 %Airline Tickets7.3 7.7 (5.2)% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to strong execution by our brand teams to add accommodations to our websites, 41advertise our brands to consumers and provide a continuously improving experience for customers on our desktop and mobile platforms. Rental car day reservations increased by 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an increase in rental car day reservations for Rentalcars.com.Airline ticket reservations decreased by 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a decline in priceline.com's retail airline ticket reservations and the discontinuation on September 1, 2016 of priceline.com’s Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservation offering, partially offset by an increase in priceline.com's Express Deals® airline ticket reservations. RevenuesWe classify our revenue into three categories: •Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Agency revenues consist primarily of travel reservation commissions, as well as certain GDS reservation booking fees and travel insurance fees, and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Substantially all of the revenue for Booking.com is agency revenue comprised of accommodation reservation commissions. •Merchant revenues are derived from services where we facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged to us by travel service providers) and travel reservation commissions in connection with (a) the accommodation reservations provided through our merchant retail accommodation reservation services at agoda.com, Booking.com and priceline.com and (b) the reservations provided through our merchant rental car service at Rentalcars.com and priceline.com’s Express Deals® reservation services; (2) transaction revenues representing the price of Name Your Own Price® reservations charged to a customer (with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues); (3) ancillary fees, including damage excess waiver and travel insurance fees and certain GDS reservation booking fees; and (4) customer processing fees charged in connection with (a) priceline.com's opaque reservation services and (b) the merchant retail accommodation reservation services at priceline.com and agoda.com. •Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (1) revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps; (2) revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) reservation fees (fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service) and (b) subscription fees earned by OpenTable for restaurant reservation management services; (3) revenues earned by priceline.com for advertising on its websites; and (4) revenues generated by Booking.com's BookingSuite branded accommodation marketing and business analytics services.

Merchant RevenuesMerchant revenues decreased by 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to decreases in revenues from priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services, 42partially offset by increases in our merchant price-disclosed accommodation reservation services, particularly at Booking.com, as well as our merchant price-disclosed rental car and airline ticket reservation services. On September 1, 2016, priceline.com’s Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservation offering was discontinued. Our priceline.com Name Your Own Price® reservation services, which declined year-over-year, are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues. Our other merchant revenues, which in total grew year-over-year, are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs. As a result, changes in Name Your Own Price® reservation revenue disproportionately affect merchant revenues as compared to our other merchant revenues. Advertising and Other RevenuesAdvertising and other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of advertising revenues, restaurant reservation revenues and subscription revenues for restaurant reservation management services. Advertising and other revenues increased by 16.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to growth in our KAYAK business, reservation fees at OpenTable, advertising revenue at priceline.com and subscription revenue at OpenTable. Cost of Revenues Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeCost of Revenues$428,314 $632,180 (32.2)% For the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost paid to travel service providers for priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® and vacation package reservation services, net of applicable taxes and charges; and (2) fees paid to third parties by KAYAK and priceline.com to return travel itinerary information for consumer search queries. Cost of revenues decreased by 32.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 was positively impacted by a reduction of travel transaction taxes of $5.1 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to a cash refund from the State of Hawaii based on a favorable ruling in the first quarter of 2015. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by a reversal of previously accrued travel transaction taxes of $16.4 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and a reduction of travel transaction taxes of $13.7 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded in the third quarter of 2015, principally related to a cash refund from the State of Hawaii, in both cases based on the aforementioned favorable ruling. Agency revenues have no cost of revenue. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeGross Profit$10,314,692 $8,591,807 20.1%Gross Margin96.0% 93.1% Total gross profit increased by 20.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 23%), primarily as a result of the increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in the year ended December 31, 2016 these revenues represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our price-disclosed reservation services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs, have been growing and priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services have been declining. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure for evaluating growth in our business. 43Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was positively impacted by a reduction of travel transaction taxes of $5.1 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to a cash refund from the State of Hawaii based on a favorable ruling in the first quarter of 2015. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by a reversal of previously accrued travel transaction taxes of $16.4 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and a reduction of travel transaction taxes of $13.7 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded in the third quarter of 2015, principally related to a cash refund from the State of Hawaii, in both cases based on the aforementioned favorable ruling. Gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is due in part to the timing of booking versus travel resulting from the impact of accelerating gross bookings growth in the year ended December 31, 2016 and an expanding booking window (a lengthening of the average time between the making of a travel reservation and the travel). Other contributing factors to the variance are business mix impacts and the use of discounted closed user group rates.Our international operations accounted for approximately $9.1 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased by 22.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 25%). Gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses increased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth in gross profit for the U.S. businesses of KAYAK and OpenTable, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit for priceline.com resulting from higher favorable travel transaction tax adjustments recorded in 2015 as compared to 2016. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangePerformance Advertising$3,479,287 $2,738,218 27.1%% of Total Gross Profit33.7% 31.9% Brand Advertising$295,698 $273,704 8.0%% of Total Gross Profit2.9% 3.2% Performance advertising expenses consist primarily of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; and (4) other performance-based advertisements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, performance advertising expenses increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily to generate increased gross bookings and gross profit. Performance advertising as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth of paid traffic channels, a year-over-year decline in advertising ROIs and timing of booking versus travel resulting from acceleration in gross bookings growth during the year.Brand advertising expenses are primarily related to our Booking.com, KAYAK, priceline.com and agoda.com businesses and consist mainly of television advertising, online video advertising (including the airing of our television advertising online) and online display advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2016, brand advertising expenses increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased online video and television advertising, including associated production costs, at Booking.com, partially offset by lower television advertising at KAYAK and priceline.com.In January 2016, we changed the presentation of advertising expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 44Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeSales and Marketing$435,225 $353,221 23.2%% of Total Gross Profit4.2% 4.1% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) customer relations costs; (4) provisions for customer chargebacks associated with merchant transactions; (5) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency accommodation commission receivables; and (6) promotional and trade show costs. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to increased transaction volumes and a higher provision for customer chargebacks associated with merchant transactions.Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangePersonnel$1,350,032 $1,166,226 15.8%% of Total Gross Profit13.1% 13.6% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes, and employee health and other benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our businesses.

General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to higher occupancy and office expenses related to the expansion of our international businesses, higher fees for outside professionals and higher personnel-related expenses related to increased headcount in our businesses. These increases were partially offset by $7.7 million of expense recognized in 2015 for a fair value adjustment to the contingent liability related to an acquisition. 45Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeInformation Technology$142,393 $113,617 25.3%% of Total Gross Profit1.4% 1.3% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; (3) outsourced data center costs; and (4) payments to outside consultants. Information technology expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased depreciation expenses due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion, as well as increased capitalized software development costs.Impairment of Goodwill Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeImpairment of Goodwill$940,700 $— N/A% of Total Gross Profit9.1% —% During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill related to OpenTable, which is not tax deductible, of $940.7 million (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeInterest Income$94,946 $55,729 70.4 %Interest Expense(207,900) (160,229) 29.8 %Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(16,913) (26,087) (35.2)%Impairment of Cost-method Investments(63,208) — N/ATotal$(193,075) $(130,587) 47.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance and higher yields. Interest 46expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to interest expense attributable to our Senior Notes issued in March 2015, November 2015 and May 2016, partially offset by the maturity of our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes in March 2015. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.""Foreign currency transactions and other"" includes foreign exchange gains or losses on derivative contracts, foreign exchange transaction gains or losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, and net realized gains or losses on investments. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange gains of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to foreign exchange losses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, resulted in foreign exchange losses of $19.6 million and $21.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign exchange losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included approximately $5.7 million of hedging cost and a foreign exchange loss related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $1.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of net realized gains related to investments. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized impairments of $63.2 million, most of which was not tax deductible, related to cost-method investments (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$578,251 $576,960 0.2% Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 21.3% and 18.4%, respectively. Our 2016 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to lower international tax rates, partially offset by the non-deductible impairment charge for goodwill of $940.7 million related to OpenTable recognized in 2016 (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the non-deductible impairment of our cost-method investment in Hotel Urbano recognized in 2016 (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our 2015 effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate as a result of lower international tax rates, partially offset by U.S. state income taxes. The non-deductible impairment charges referred to above have caused our effective tax rate to be higher for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase has been partially offset by the favorable impact of an increased proportion of our income being taxed at lower international tax rates due to the growth of our international businesses and the tax benefits recorded in 2016 arising from U.S. state tax law changes resulting in a net decrease to deferred tax liabilities, mostly associated with acquired intangible assets.A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on the Company's effective tax rate for those periods. While we expect Booking.com to continue to qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatment with respect to a portion of its earnings for the foreseeable future, the loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit, whether due to a change in tax law or a determination by the Dutch government that Booking.com's activities are not ""innovative"" or for any other reason, would substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We may not be able to maintain our 'Innovation Box Tax' benefit.""Until our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire, most of our U.S. income will not be subject to a cash tax liability, other than U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes. However, we expect to pay foreign taxes on our international income except in countries where we have net operating loss carryforwards. We expect that our international operations will grow their pretax income faster than our U.S. businesses over the long term and, therefore, it is our expectation that our cash tax payments will increase as our international businesses generate an increasing share of our pretax income and as our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire. 47As of December 31, 2016, we held approximately $12.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments outside of the United States. We intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our international subsidiaries outside of the United States. If that intention changes and we decide to repatriate that cash to the United States, whether due to cash needs in the United States or otherwise, we would incur related U.S. income tax expense, but we would only make income tax payments when we repatriate the cash. We would pay only U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and U.S. state income taxes as long as we have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset our U.S. taxable income. As of December 31, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $727.8 million and $583.9 million for U.S. federal and state tax purposes, respectively. If our foreign earnings were repatriated, we could be subject to a cash income tax liability on the earnings of our U.S. businesses sooner than would otherwise have been the case. After our net operating loss carryforwards have been fully utilized or expire, foreign tax credits associated with the repatriation of international cash may be used to reduce U.S. federal taxes on the repatriation. 48Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 Operating and Statistical Metrics Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 ChangeAgency$47,969 $42,892 11.8%Merchant7,559 7,409 2.0%Total$55,528 $50,300 10.4% Gross bookings increased by 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 25%), principally due to growth of 24.9% in accommodation room night reservations, 2% growth on a constant-currency basis in ADRs and growth of 15.6% in rental car day reservations, partially offset by the impact foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that unit growth rates and total gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant-currency basis, each of which exclude the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Agency gross bookings increased 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to growth in gross bookings from Booking.com agency accommodation room night reservations, as well as growth in gross bookings by priceline.com and Rentalcars.com agency retail rental car reservation services, and priceline.com and agoda.com agency retail hotel reservation services, partially offset by lower retail airfares. Merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Merchant gross bookings increased 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increases in gross bookings by merchant retail hotel reservation services for Booking.com and priceline.com, Rentalcars.com's rental car reservation service, and priceline.com's Express Deals® hotel reservation service as well as the inclusion of our Rocketmiles hotel reservation service since its acquisition in February 2015. These increases were partially offset by declines in gross bookings by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services and the impact of the stronger U.S. Dollar on agoda.com's merchant retail hotel reservation service. The U.S. Dollar was significantly stronger against the Euro and many other currencies throughout 2015 compared to 2014, which significantly adversely affected the growth of our agency and merchant gross bookings, expressed in U.S. Dollars.Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 ChangeRoom Nights432.3 346.0 24.9 %Rental Car Days59.9 51.8 15.6 %Airline Tickets7.7 7.8 (1.6)% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 24.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in Booking.com, agoda.com and priceline.com accommodation room night reservations and the inclusion of Rocketmiles accommodation room night reservations since its acquisition in February 2015. Booking.com included over 850,000 properties on its website as of February 15, 2016, which included approximately 390,000 vacation rental properties (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website), compared to over 635,000 properties (including approximately 269,000 vacation rental properties) a year ago. In September 2015, Booking.com changed the way it calculates property counts. As a result, properties that are contracted with Booking.com but temporarily do not have availability on Booking.com (for example properties that are closed during their off-peak season or for renovations) will remain 49included in Booking.com's property counts during these temporary periods. Booking.com previously excluded properties that were temporarily unavailable for booking. We believe that continuously including them provides a more consistent and useful property count.Rental car day reservations increased by 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in price-disclosed rental car day reservations for Rentalcars.com and priceline.com, partially offset by a decline in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® rental car day reservations.Airline ticket reservations decreased by 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to a decline in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservations.

The U.S. Dollar was significantly stronger against the Euro and many other currencies throughout 2015 compared to 2014, which significantly adversely affected the growth of our agency revenues, expressed in U.S. Dollars.Merchant RevenuesMerchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 4.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to decreases in revenues from priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® hotel, airline ticket and rental car reservation services, partially offset by increases in our merchant price-disclosed hotel and rental car businesses. Our priceline.com Name Your Own Price® reservation services, which declined year-over-year, are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues. Our other merchant revenues, which in total grew year-over-year, are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs. As a result, changes in Name Your Own Price® reservation revenue disproportionately affect merchant revenues as compared to our other merchant revenues. The U.S. Dollar was significantly stronger against the Euro and many other currencies throughout 2015 compared to 2014, which significantly adversely affected the growth of our merchant revenues, expressed in U.S. Dollars.Advertising and Other RevenuesAdvertising and other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of advertising revenues, restaurant reservation revenues and subscription revenues for restaurant reservation management services. Advertising and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased 49.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable revenues in 2015 compared to only a partial year's results in 2014, as well as growth in our KAYAK business. Cost of Revenues Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeCost of Revenues$632,180 $857,841 (26.3)% 50For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost paid to travel service providers for priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® and vacation package reservation services, net of applicable taxes and charges; and (2) fees paid to third parties by KAYAK and priceline.com to return travel itinerary information for consumer search queries. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by 26.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of revenue benefited from a reversal of previously accrued travel transaction taxes of $16.4 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to a favorable ruling in the State of Hawaii. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a net reduction in cost of revenue in the third quarter of 2015 of $13.7 million related to travel transaction taxes, principally due to a cash refund from the State of Hawaii for the aforementioned favorable ruling. Agency revenues have no cost of revenue. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeGross Profit$8,591,807 $7,584,130 13.3%Gross Margin93.1% 89.8% Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 13.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 27%), primarily as a result of the increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Name Your Own Price® revenues are recorded ""gross"" with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in the year ended December 31, 2015 these revenues represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in the year ended December 31, 2014. Our price-disclosed reservation services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs, have been growing faster than priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure for evaluating growth in our business.Our international operations accounted for approximately $7.4 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased by 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 28%). Gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses increased by 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by the inclusion of OpenTable, which benefited year-over-year comparisons through the anniversary of the acquisition on July 24, 2015. In addition, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by a reversal of previously accrued travel transaction taxes of $16.4 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to a favorable ruling in the State of Hawaii. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was also positively impacted by a net reduction in cost of revenue in the third quarter of 2015 of $13.7 million related to travel transaction taxes, principally due to a cash refund from the State of Hawaii for the aforementioned favorable ruling.The U.S. Dollar was significantly stronger against the Euro and many other currencies throughout 2015 compared to 2014. At these exchange rates, the growth of our total and international gross bookings, expressed in U.S. Dollars, was significantly adversely impacted in 2015. 51Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangePerformance Advertising$2,738,218 $2,334,453 17.3%% of Total Gross Profit31.9% 30.8% Brand Advertising$273,704 $257,077 6.5%% of Total Gross Profit3.2% 3.4% Performance advertising expenses consist primarily of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; and (4) banner, pop-up and other Internet and mobile advertisements. For the year ended December 31, 2015, performance advertising expenses increased 17.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased spending on online performance marketing to generate increased gross bookings. Performance advertising as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 benefited from the inclusion of OpenTable because OpenTable spends a lower percentage of gross profit on performance advertising relative to our other brands. In addition, the share of our business coming directly to our websites with no associated performance advertising expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. These favorable impacts were more than offset for the year ended December 31, 2015 by a year-over-year decline in advertising ROIs.Brand advertising expenses are primarily related to our Booking.com, KAYAK and priceline.com businesses and primarily consist of television advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2015, brand advertising increased 6.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased online video and television advertising, including associated production costs, at Booking.com, partially offset by lower television advertising at KAYAK and, to a lesser extent, priceline.com.Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeSales and Marketing$353,221 $310,910 13.6%% of Total Gross Profit4.1% 4.1% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) customer relations costs; (4) public relations costs; (5) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency accommodation commission receivables; and (6) provisions for customer chargebacks. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to increased gross booking volumes, customer relations costs and the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable's results as compared to only a partial year's results in 2014.Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangePersonnel$1,166,226 $950,191 22.7%% of Total Gross Profit13.6% 12.5% 52Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our businesses. Additionally, the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable's results in our 2015 consolidated results as compared to only a partial year's results in 2014 contributed to the increase in personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$415,420 $352,869 17.7%% of Total Gross Profit4.8% 4.7% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) personnel-related expenses such as travel, recruiting and training expenses; and (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to higher occupancy and office expenses related to the expansion of our international businesses and higher personnel-related expenses related to increased headcount in all of our businesses. Additionally, the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable's results in our 2015 consolidated results as compared to only a partial year's results in 2014 contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeInformation Technology$113,617 $97,498 16.5%% of Total Gross Profit1.3% 1.3% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; (3) outsourced data center costs; and (4) payments to outside consultants. Information technology expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations. Additionally, the inclusion of a full year of OpenTable's results in our 2015 consolidated results as compared to only a partial year's results in 2014 contributed to the increase in information technology expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$272,494 $207,820 31.1%% of Total Gross Profit3.2% 2.7% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) depreciation of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2015, depreciation and amortization expense increased, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to increased intangible amortization from the OpenTable acquisition and increased depreciation expense due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com 53business. Additionally, the inclusion of OpenTable in our consolidated results since its acquisition on July 24, 2014 contributed to the increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeInterest Income$55,729 $13,933 300.0%Interest Expense(160,229) (88,353) 81.4%Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(26,087) (9,444) 176.2%Total$(130,587) $(83,864) 55.7% For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance and higher yields. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to interest expense attributable to our Senior Notes issued in August 2014, September 2014, March 2015 and November 2015, partially offset by the maturity of our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes in March 2015. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign exchange losses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to foreign exchange gains of $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Foreign exchange transaction losses, including costs related to foreign exchange transactions, resulted in losses of $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which includes approximately $5.7 million of hedging cost and a foreign exchange loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, compared to foreign exchange losses of $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $2.2 million of net realized gains related to investments, which are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The conversion of our convertible debt prior to maturity in the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in non-cash losses of $6.3 million, which are recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$576,960 $567,695 1.6% Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 18.4% and 19.0%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to lower tax rates outside the United States, partially offset by U.S. state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. Our effective tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increased proportion of our income being taxed at lower international tax rates. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on the Company's effective tax rate for those periods. 54Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016, we had $13.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments. Approximately $12.6 billion is held by our international subsidiaries and is denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, Euros and, to a lesser extent, British Pounds Sterling and other currencies. Cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments are comprised of U.S. and international corporate bonds, U.S. and international government securities, high-grade commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, convertible debt securities and equity securities of Ctrip, money market funds and time deposits (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).We intend to indefinitely reinvest the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries outside of the United States. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $13.0 billion cumulative unremitted international earnings. We estimate that the deferred tax liability we would record if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested internationally is approximately $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. If we repatriate cash to the United States, we would utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and beyond that amount incur additional tax payments in the United States.In May 2016, we issued Senior Notes due June 1, 2026, with an interest rate of 3.6% (the ""2026 Notes"") for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, beginning December 1, 2016. The net proceeds of these notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include share repurchases, repayment of debt and acquisitions. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the 2026 Notes.In June 2015, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.50%; or the greatest of (a) Bank of America, N.A.'s prime lending rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (c) an adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.085% to 0.20%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $70.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $50.0 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding and approximately $3.8 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. Our Convertible Senior Notes due March 15, 2018, with an interest rate of 1.0% (the ""2018 Notes""), are convertible at the option of the holders as of December 31, 2016, and, accordingly, we reported the carrying value of the 2018 Notes as a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. We have received a notice for conversion of $3 thousand aggregate principal amount for the 2018 Notes through February 24, 2017. If note holders exercise their option to convert, we would be required to repay the principal amount of the 2018 Notes in cash and may deliver shares of common stock or cash, at our option, to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. We may borrow under the revolving credit facility to satisfy our obligation. In September 2016, we invested $25 million in a Ctrip six-year senior convertible note issued at par value and $25 million in Ctrip ordinary shares. In September 2016, we signed a turnkey agreement to construct an office building in the Netherlands for the future headquarters of Booking.com for approximately 270 million Euros. Upon signing the agreement, we paid approximately 48 million Euros to the developer, principally related to acquired land use rights, and we expect to pay approximately 34 million Euros related to building construction during 2017, with the remainder of payments being paid periodically beginning in 2018 until the expected completion of the building in late 2020. We will also incur capital expenditures to fit out and furnish the office space. We utilized international cash for the September 2016 payment and we expect all future payments to be made from international cash. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 762,984 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $1.0 billion, which includes stock repurchases in December 2016 of 10,215 shares for an aggregate cost of $15.0 million that were settled in January 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a remaining authorization of $2.1 billion to purchase its common stock. In the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock, in addition to amounts previously authorized. We may from time to time make additional repurchases of our common stock, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. We 55may use cash-on-hand and cash generated by our operations in the United States to fund our share repurchases. We may also utilize our revolving credit facility or raise funds through the debt capital markets to fund share repurchases.On February 7, 2017, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Momondo Group. We will use approximately $550 million of our international cash to fund this acquisition. The deal is expected to close later in the year, subject to regulatory approval. Our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from consumers and then we pay most of our travel service providers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in accounts receivable, deferred merchant bookings and travel service provider payables seasonally depending on the absolute level of our merchant transactions during the last few weeks of every quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $3.9 billion, resulting from net income of $2.1 billion, a favorable impact of $1.6 billion for non-cash items not affecting cash flows and net favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $215.9 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2016, were primarily related to a $516.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $284.2 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were principally associated with impairment of goodwill, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of cost-method investments, amortization of debt discount on our convertible notes and deferred income taxes.Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $3.1 billion, resulting from net income of $2.6 billion and a favorable impact of $558.9 million for non-cash items not affecting cash flows, partially offset by net unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $8.0 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2015, were primarily related to a $166.2 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $68.7 million increase in accounts receivable and $81.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and deferred income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $2.9 billion, resulting from net income of $2.4 billion and a favorable impact of non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $518.0 million, slightly offset by net unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $25.4 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2014, were primarily related to a $203.9 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $182.2 million increase in accounts receivable and $48.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and deferred income taxes.Net cash used in investing activities was $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 were principally affected by net purchases of investments of $3.1 billion and $48.5 million for the acquisition of land use rights. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 were affected by net purchases of investments of $3.6 billion, $140.3 million used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by net proceeds of $5.2 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were affected by payments of $2.5 billion for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and net cash payments of $80.3 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts slightly offset by net sales of investments of $350.3 million. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment was $219.9 million, $173.9 and $131.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increases for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were related to additional data center capacity and new offices to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com and agoda.com brands in 2016 and principally related to our Booking.com brand in 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities was $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of net proceeds of $994.7 million from the issuance of Senior Notes, excess tax benefits on stock-based awards and other equity deductions of $61.0 million and the exercise of employee stock options of $15.6 million, partially offset by treasury stock purchases of $1.0 billion. Net cash used in financing activities was $730.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of treasury stock purchases of $3.1 billion, payments of $147.6 million related to 56the conversion of Senior Notes and payment of $10.7 million related to the settlement of the acquisition-date estimated contingent liability related to an acquisition, primarily offset by the total proceeds of $2.4 billion from the issuance of Senior Notes, excess tax benefits on stock-based awards of $101.5 million and the exercise of employee stock options of $20.9 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily consisted of total proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of Convertible Senior Notes and Euro denominated Senior Notes, excess tax benefits on stock-based awards of $23.4 million and the exercise of employee stock options of $16.4 million, partially offset by treasury stock purchases of $750.4 million and payments of $125.1 million related to the conversion of Senior Notes.ContingenciesFrench tax authorities recently concluded an audit that started in 2013 of the years 2003 through 2012 to determine whether Booking.com is in compliance with its tax obligations in France. Booking.com received formal assessments in December 2015 in which the French tax authorities claim that Booking.com has a permanent establishment in France and seek to recover unpaid income taxes and value-added taxes of approximately 356 million Euros, the majority of which would represent penalties and interest. We believe that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with French tax law and we intend to contest the assessments. If we are unable to resolve the matter with the French authorities, we would expect to challenge the assessments in the French courts. In order to contest the assessments in court, we may be required to pay, upfront, the full amount or a significant part of any such assessments, though any such payment would not constitute an admission by us that we owe the taxes. At the end of 2016, French authorities announced their intention to also audit the tax years 2013 to 2015, which could result in additional assessments. See Part I Item IA Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""A number of U.S. jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against online travel companies, including us, related to, among other things, the payment of travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). In addition, a number of U.S. states, counties and municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of travel transaction taxes. For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Adverse application of U.S. state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations."" in this Annual Report.As a result of this litigation and other attempts by U.S. jurisdictions to levy similar taxes, we have established an accrual (including estimated interest and penalties) for the potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes in the amount of approximately $27 million as of both December 31, 2016 and 2015. The accrual is based on our estimate of the probable cost of resolving these issues. Our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued. The actual cost may be less or greater, potentially significantly, than the liabilities recorded. An estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued cannot be reasonably made. If we were to suffer adverse determinations in the near term in more of the pending proceedings than currently anticipated given results to date, because of our available cash we believe that it would not have a material impact on our liquidity.The following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016: Payments due by Period (in thousands)Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations(1) $523,820 $102,339 $193,885 $134,124 $93,472Land lease obligation(1) 63,851 1,317 2,633 2,633 57,268Building construction obligation(1) 233,385 34,860 136,516 62,009 —Senior Notes(2) 8,481,228 137,794 1,260,587 2,250,337 4,832,510Revolving credit facility(3) 9,447 3,188 5,075 1,184 —Earnout - acquisition 9,170 — 9,170 — —Total(4) $9,320,901 $279,498 $1,607,866 $2,450,287 $4,983,250(1)See the section on ""Operating Leases"" and ""Building Construction"" section of Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2)Represents the aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and cumulative interest to maturity of $1.1 billion. Convertible debt does not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding 57principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or shares of common stock at our option. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(3)Represents fees on uncommitted funds and outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2016.(4)We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $139 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016, of which approximately $53 million related to deferred rents, approximately $30 million related to unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and approximately $27 million related to our accrual for the potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for the liabilities related to travel transaction taxes and unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Therefore, we have excluded long-term liabilities of $130 million from the contractual obligations table above because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments or the liability is related to deferred rents, which represents the difference in rent expense recognized in the income statements and rent payments related to operating leases. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use currency exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2016. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2016, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future.Fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our available-for-sale investments assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. As of December 31, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments in debt securities by approximately $204 million. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity. This amount excludes our investment in Ctrip.com International Ltd. (""Ctrip"") senior convertible notes, which are also subject to market price risk, which could potentially have a more significant impact on the change in fair value. The fair 58value of our Ctrip senior convertible notes will likely increase as the market price of Ctrip's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") increase and decrease as the price of Ctrip's ADSs fall. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was approximately $7.4 billion. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. A substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount is related to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible notes.We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euros). As a result, we face exposures to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the operating results of our international operations are translated from local currencies into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, result in gains and losses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Throughout 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened significantly year-over-year relative to substantially all currencies in which we transact, most notably the Euro, Brazilian Real, British Pound Sterling, Russian Ruble and Australian Dollar. In 2016, the U.S. Dollar continued to be stronger year-over-year relative to the British Pound Sterling, Russian Ruble and many other major currencies in which we transact. Since the “Brexit” referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016, the U.S. Dollar has strengthened significantly against the British Pound Sterling. As a result of these currency exchange rate changes, our foreign currency denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses and net income have been negatively impacted as expressed in U.S. Dollars, although to a much lesser extent in 2016 than in 2015. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. The aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes, and accrued interest thereon, provide a natural hedge of the net assets of certain of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries.From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations in our consolidated operating results. Our derivative contracts principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and certain other currencies versus the U.S. Dollar. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no such outstanding derivative contracts. Foreign exchange gains of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, foreign exchange losses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and foreign exchange gains of $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 were recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.",2023-12-30 18:44:28.338434
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2018,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include those discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.OverviewOur mission is to help people experience the world. We aim to achieve our mission to help people experience the world through global leadership in online travel and restaurant reservation and related services by:•providing consumers with the best choices and prices at any time, in any place, on any device;•making it easy for people to find, book and experience their travel desires; and•providing platforms, tools and insights to our business partners to help them be successful.We operate six primary brands: •Booking.com - the world’s leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations, based on room nights booked.•priceline.com - a leading hotel, rental car, airline ticket and vacation package reservation service in the United States.•KAYAK - a leading meta-search service allowing consumers to easily search and compare travel itineraries and prices, including airline ticket, accommodation and rental car reservation information, from hundreds of travel websites at once.•agoda.com - a leading accommodation reservation service catering primarily to consumers in the Asia-Pacific region.•Rentalcars.com - a leading worldwide rental car reservation service.•OpenTable - a leading provider of restaurant reservation and information services to consumers and restaurant reservation management and customer acquisition services to restaurants.We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands collectively as ""Booking Holdings,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us.""Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda.com and Rentalcars.com (which began operating as part of Booking.com on January 1, 2018) and the international businesses of KAYAK and OpenTable. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the United States is part of our international results. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 89% of our consolidated gross profit. A significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.We derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following sources:•Commissions earned from facilitating reservations of accommodations, rental cars and other travel services on an agency basis;•Transaction gross profit on a merchant basis and customer processing fees from our accommodation, rental car, airline ticket and vacation package reservation services; 36•Advertising revenues primarily earned by KAYAK from sending referrals to online travel companies (""OTCs"") and travel service providers, as well as from advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps;•Reservation revenues paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation services, subscription fees for restaurant reservation management services provided by OpenTable; and•Damage excess waiver fees, travel insurance fees and global distribution system (""GDS"") reservation booking fees, in each case related to certain of our travel services.Our priceline.com brand offers merchant Name Your Own Price® opaque travel services, which are recorded in revenue on a ""gross"" basis and have associated cost of revenue. All of our other services are generally recorded in revenue on a ""net"" basis and have no significant associated cost of revenue. Therefore, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of our revenues between Name Your Own Price® travel services and other services. Gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for all of our services. Consequently, gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business because, in contrast to our revenues, it is not affected by the different methods of recording revenue and cost of revenue between our Name Your Own Price® travel reservation services and our other services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard which will change the presentation of our Name Your Own Price® revenue to a net basis (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, and, as a result, we will no longer report cost of revenues or gross profit.TrendsOver the last several years we have experienced strong growth in our accommodation reservation services. We believe this growth is the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the widespread adoption of mobile devices and the growth of travel overall, including in higher growth emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and South America. We also believe this growth is the result of the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to add accommodations to our travel reservation services, increase and improve content, build distribution and improve the consumer experience on our websites and mobile apps, as well as consistently and effectively marketing our brands through performance and brand advertising efforts. These year-over-year growth rates have generally decelerated. Given the size of our accommodation reservation business, we expect that our year-over-year growth rates will generally continue to decelerate, though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate and there may be periods of acceleration from time to time.Our international business represents the substantial majority of our financial results, and we expect our operating results and other financial metrics to continue to be largely driven by international performance. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States, and recent international online travel growth rates have exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. Over the long term, we expect that international online travel growth rates will follow a similar trend to that experienced in the United States. In addition, the base of hotel properties in Europe and Asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the leading online accommodation reservation service provider in the world as measured by room nights booked. We believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the markets in which we operate.Our growth has primarily been generated by our worldwide accommodation reservation service brand, Booking.com, which is our most significant brand, and has been due, in part, to the availability of a large and growing number of instantly bookable properties through Booking.com. Booking.com included approximately 1,586,000 properties on its website as of December 31, 2017, consisting of approximately 396,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 1,190,000 homes, apartments and other unique places to stay (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website), compared to approximately 1,115,000 properties (including approximately 339,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 776,000 homes, apartments and other unique places to stay) as of December 31, 2016. Booking.com has begun categorizing properties listed on its website as either (a) hotels, motels and resorts, which groups together more traditional accommodation types (including hostels, resorts, inns and motels), or (b) homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, also referred to as alternative accommodations, which encompasses all other types of accommodations, including homes, apartments, villas, igloos and beyond. Booking.com previously classified properties as hotels, vacation rentals or other. We believe the new categories are more consistent with those used by other industry participants and allow for a more direct comparison of traditional and unique property counts among companies.We intend to continue to invest in adding accommodations available for reservation on our websites, such as hotels, motels, resorts, homes, apartments and other unique places to stay. Many of the newer accommodations we add to our travel 37reservation services, especially in highly-penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms or higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of consumers (e.g., hostels and bed and breakfasts). Because alternative accommodations are often either a single unit or a small collection of independent units, these properties generally represent more limited booking opportunities than hotels, motels and resorts, which generally have more units to rent per property. Further, alternative accommodations in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism seasons, weather or other factors or may not be available at peak times due to use by the property owners, and we may also experience lower profit margins with respect to these properties due to certain additional costs related to offering these accommodations on our websites. As we increase our alternative accommodation business, these different characteristics could negatively impact our profit margins; and, to the extent these properties represent an increasing percentage of the properties added to our websites, we expect that our gross bookings growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time (since each such property has fewer booking opportunities). As a result of the foregoing, as the percentage of alternative accommodation properties increases, the number of reservations per property will likely continue to decrease. We believe that continuing to expand the number and variety of accommodations available through our services, in particular Booking.com, will help us to continue to grow our accommodation reservation business.As part of our strategy to increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com, Booking.com is increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis where it facilitates payments on behalf of customers. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for properties that do not accept credit cards and to increase its ability to offer flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that adding these types of properties and service offerings will benefit our customers and our gross bookings, room night and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional payment processing costs, chargebacks and other costs related to these transactions. As this business continues to grow, we may experience a significant increase in payment processing costs, chargebacks and other costs related to these transactions, which are recorded as sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and which negatively impact our operating margins.Perceived or actual adverse economic conditions, including slow, slowing or negative economic growth, unemployment rates and weakening currencies and concerns over government responses such as higher taxes and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. Further, political uncertainty, conditions or events, such as the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (""Brexit"") and concerns regarding certain E.U. members with sovereign debt default risks can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. At times, we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates, increased cancellation rates and weaker trends in hotel average daily rates (""ADRs"") across many regions of the world, particularly in those countries that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainties, which we believe are due at least in part to these macro-economic conditions and concerns. For more detail, see Part II Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""These and other macro-economic uncertainties, such as geopolitical tensions and differing central bank monetary policies, have led to significant volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and other currencies. Significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, stock markets and oil prices can also impact consumer travel behavior. As noted earlier, our international business represents a substantial majority of our financial results. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international businesses are translated from local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. As a result of currency exchange rate changes, our foreign-currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses and net income have been positively impacted as expressed in U.S. Dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For example, gross profit from our international operations grew 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, but, without the positive impact of changes in currency exchange rates, grew year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 21%. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. The aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated long-term debt, and accrued interest thereon, provide a natural hedge against the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of certain of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries. For more information, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.""We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated operating results into U.S. Dollars. However, such derivative instruments are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuations that could impact growth rates for our gross bookings, revenues or gross profit (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts). 38We compete globally with both online and traditional providers of travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive and current and new competitors can launch new services to compete with us at relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon and Facebook, have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market, including by establishing a flight meta-search product (Google Flights) and a hotel meta-search business (Google Hotel Ads) that are growing rapidly, as well as its ""Book on Google"" reservation functionality and its Google Trips app. Our markets are also subject to rapidly changing conditions, including technological developments, consumer behavior changes, regulatory changes and travel service provider consolidation. We expect these trends to continue. For example, we have experienced a significant shift of both direct and indirect business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Advertising and distribution opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes. In addition, the gross profit earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance. For more detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face, see Part I Item 1 Business - ""Competition,"" Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance."" and ""Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates new challenges and may enable device companies such as Apple to compete directly with us."" and ""We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological changes."" Although we believe that providing an extensive collection of properties, excellent customer service and an intuitive, easy to use website or mobile experience are important factors influencing a consumer's decision to make a reservation, for many consumers, particularly in certain markets, the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether a consumer will book a reservation. We have observed an increase in promotional pricing to closed user groups (such as loyalty program participants or consumers with registered accounts), including through mobile apps. In addition, many large hotel chains and OTCs have launched initiatives, such as increased discounting and incentives, to encourage consumers to book accommodations through their websites. Discounting and couponing coupled with a high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in Asian markets, while brand loyalty in such markets is less important. In some cases, our competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction, or offer travel services at a loss, in order to gain market share. In addition to providing retail travel reservation services, our priceline.com brand is a leading provider of discounted opaque travel reservation services in the United States through its Express Deals® and Name Your Own Price® offerings. These discounted services are referred to as ""opaque"" because certain elements of the reservation, including the name of the travel service provider, are not made known to the traveler until after the reservation is made. In general, we expect that over time our opaque services will continue to decrease in relative importance to our overall business due, we believe, to a variety of factors, including the growth rates of our retail businesses, competition, relative complexity, travel restrictions often required by the travel service provider, difficulty in offering certain of these services on mobile devices, increased discounts available to consumers through closed user groups or couponing, and limited availability of discounted travel reservations from travel service providers, particularly during periods of high consumer demand.We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Both our performance and brand advertising expenses have increased significantly in recent years, a trend we expect to continue. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our total performance advertising expense was approximately $4.1 billion, $3.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our websites. We also invested approximately $392 million, $296 million and $274 million in brand advertising during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing television advertising, online video advertising (for example, on YouTube and Facebook) and online display advertising. We intend to continue a strategy of promoting brand awareness through both online and offline advertising efforts, including by expanding brand campaigns into additional markets, and we expect our brand advertising expenses to increase significantly during 2018. We have observed increased brand advertising by OTCs, meta-search services and travel service providers, particularly in North America and Europe, which may make our brand advertising efforts more expensive and less effective.Performance advertising efficiency, expressed as performance advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit, is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are, in some cases, outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers and the extent to which consumers come directly to our websites or mobile apps for bookings. For example, competition for desired rankings in search results and/or a decline in ad clicks by consumers could increase our costs-per-click and reduce our 39performance advertising efficiency. We have also experienced increasing cancellation rates, which we expect to continue and which negatively affects our advertising efficiency and results of operations. Changes by Google in how it presents travel search results, including by placing its own offerings at or near the top of search results, or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites. Similarly, changes by our other search and meta-search partners in how they present travel search results or the manner in which they conduct the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites. We have observed a long-term trend of decreasing performance advertising returns on investment (""ROIs""), a trend we expect to continue, though the rate of decrease may fluctuate and there may be periods of stable or increasing ROIs from time to time. In addition, we may from time to time, as we did in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, pursue a strategy of improving our performance advertising ROIs, which could negatively impact growth and positively impact performance advertising efficiency. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We rely on performance and brand advertising channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites and grow our business."" and ""Our business could be negatively affected by changes in internet search engine algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.""We estimate our effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 18-21%, which represents our best estimate of our tax expense including the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act""), estimated U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes on our international earnings, and an increase in the Innovation Box Tax rate in the Netherlands from 5% to 7%. The provisions of the Tax Act are broad and complex, and to date there has been little interpretation or clarification of the act from U.S. tax authorities. As a result, our estimate is based on our current understanding and could change as more information becomes available. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities."" and ""We may not be able to maintain our 'Innovation Box Tax' benefit.""The national competition authorities (""NCAs"") of many governments have conducted or are conducting investigations into competitive practices within the online travel industry, and we may be involved or affected by such investigations and their results. Some countries have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practices within the online travel industry. For example, France and Italy, among others, have adopted legislation making price parity agreements illegal and similar legislation is under consideration in other countries. For more information on these investigations and their potential effects on our business, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""As the size of our business grows, we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti-trust, competition and consumer protection regulators."" In addition to the price parity investigations, from time to time NCAs, other governmental agencies, trade associations and private parties take legal actions, including commencing legal proceedings, that may affect our operations. For example, in March 2017, in connection with a lawsuit begun in 2015 by the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies claiming that Booking.com is required to meet certain registration requirements in Turkey, a Turkish court ordered Booking.com to suspend offering Turkish hotels and accommodations to Turkish residents. Although Booking.com is appealing the order and believes it to be without basis, this order has had, and is likely to continue to have, a negative impact on our growth and results of operations.SeasonalityA meaningful amount of our gross bookings are generated early in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. However, historically we generally have not recognized revenue from these bookings until the travel is completed (on ""check-out""), which can be in a quarter other than when the reservation is booked. Beginning on January 1, 2018, we began recognizing revenue for financial reporting purposes in our 2018 financial statements when the travel begins (on ""check-in""), which can also be in a quarter other than when the reservation is booked. In contrast, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as the expense is incurred, which, in the case of performance advertising in particular, is typically in the quarter in which associated reservations are booked. As a result of this potential timing difference between when we record advertising expense and when we recognize associated revenue, we have historically experienced our highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of accommodation check-outs for the year for our European and North American businesses. We expect this to continue under our new revenue recognition policy. The first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience additional volatility in earnings growth rates due to these and other seasonal timing factors. For our Asia-Pacific business, we experience the highest levels of accommodation bookings in the third and fourth quarters of the year, and the highest levels of accommodation check-outs in the fourth quarter. As the relative growth rates for these businesses fluctuate, the quarterly distribution of our operating results may vary.In recent years, we experienced an expansion of the booking window (the average time between the making of a travel reservation and the travel), which impacts the relationship between our gross bookings (recognized at the time of booking) and our revenue and gross profit (recognized at the time of check-out or, after January 1, 2018, at the time of check-in). Recently, 40we have seen a modest contraction of the booking window. Future changes in the booking window may cause additional differences between our gross bookings growth rates and revenue growth rates.Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, the timing of revenue recognition for travel reservation services will change. For example, revenue for accommodation reservation services, which is primarily recognized at check-out under the current accounting standard, will change to be recognized at check-in under the new revenue standard. We currently expect this timing change will not have a significant impact to our annual revenues and net income, although the effects on quarterly revenues and net income are expected to be more significant because a meaningful amount of travel typically starts in December each year and is completed in January of the following year. Under the new revenue standard, this revenue will be recognized in the fourth quarter each year rather than the first quarter of the following year. Therefore, we estimate that revenue will be more than 2% lower in first quarter of 2018, slightly less than 1% lower in second and third quarters of 2018 and 4% higher in fourth quarter of 2018 recognized at check-in, as it is under the new revenue standard, than it would have been if recognized at check-out, as it would have been under the current accounting standard.In addition, the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results. For example, in 2017, our second quarter year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were positively impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, as it did in 2016. Conversely, our first quarter 2017 year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were adversely impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, as it did in 2016. Similar to 2017, in 2018 Easter will fall in the second quarter instead of the first quarter. However, because Easter will be on April 1, 2018 and we expect that a meaningful amount of Easter travel will commence in the week leading up to Easter, which is during the first quarter 2018, we expect that Easter will have a negative effect on our second quarter 2018 year-over-year growth rates and a positive effect on our first quarter 2018 year-over-year growth rates due to the change in our revenue recognition policy from ""check-out"" to ""check-in."" The timing of other holidays such as Chinese New Year, Ramadan and Carnival can also impact our quarterly year-over-year growth rates.The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business. For example, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable advertising expense. In addition, gross profit growth is typically less impacted by decelerating gross bookings growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters. Conversely, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate accelerates, our operating margins are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable advertising expense. In addition, gross profit growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters.Other FactorsWe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel and travel-related services. Factors beyond our control, such as oil prices, stock market volatility, terrorist attacks, unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, droughts and volcanic eruptions, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Zika and MERS, political instability, changes in economic conditions, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities or travel-related accidents, can disrupt travel or otherwise result in declines in travel demand. Because these events or concerns, and the full impact of their effects, are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services, which can adversely affect our business and results of operations. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. We have experienced pressure on operating margins as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, acquisitions. As the overall size of our business has grown, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of services and technologies, including services and technologies that may be outside of our historical core business, and our ability to keep pace may slow. Potential competitors, such as emerging start-ups, may be able to innovate and focus on developing a particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new services or technologies before us. Some of our larger competitors or potential competitors have more resources or more established or diversified relationships with consumers than we do, and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our 41competitive position, including by making acquisitions, entering or investing in travel reservation businesses, investing in research and development, and competing aggressively for highly-skilled employees. Our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain and highly competitive environment in which we operate makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:•Valuation of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair value are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable and, when we deem appropriate, include assistance from a third-party valuation firm. The purchase price consideration is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price consideration over the net of the amounts allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date.We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. A substantial portion of our intangibles and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable in July 2014 and KAYAK in May 2013. As of September 30, 2017, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test. Other than OpenTable, the fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values. OpenTableWe estimated OpenTable’s fair value using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approaches (EBITDA multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies and precedent transactions). At September 30, 2017, OpenTable's fair value was approximately 18% higher than its fair value at September 30, 2016, which reflects performance that exceeded forecast. Despite this increase in fair value, OpenTable's fair value was approximately 6% lower than its carrying value at September 30, 2017, thus failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Therefore, we received assistance from a third-party valuation firm to develop a hypothetical purchase price allocation (Step 2). The results of Step 2 indicated there was no goodwill impairment at September 30, 2017 because the implied fair value of OpenTable's goodwill exceeded its carrying value by approximately 24%. We tested the recoverability of OpenTable’s other long-lived assets and concluded there was no impairment as of September 30, 2017. Since the annual impairment test as of September 30, 2017, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment.For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill of $940.7 million, which was not tax deductible. If OpenTable does not achieve the results currently expected or if any of the assumptions underlying our estimate of the fair value of the OpenTable business prove to be incorrect, we may refine our forecast for the OpenTable business and recognize an additional goodwill impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""The success of our acquisition of OpenTable is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties."" 42•Income Taxes. We determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act imposes a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. The Tax Act also introduced in 2018 a tax on 50% of global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), which is income determined to be in excess of a specified routine rate of return, and also introduced a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) aimed at preventing the erosion of the U.S. tax base. We continue to review the GILTI and BEAT provisions of the Tax Act for applicability to us and expect further guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, U.S. state tax authorities and/or other authorities on the application of these provisions. We have not yet adopted an accounting policy as to whether we will treat taxes on GILTI as period costs or whether we will recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal.The provisions of Tax Act are broad and complex, and there are significant uncertainties about how it will be interpreted at both the U.S. federal and state levels, and limited guidance is available from tax authorities at this time. Further interpretation and implementation of the Tax Act may materially impact our provisional income tax expense and future income tax expense and obligations.On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") was issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when the registrant does not have all the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. In accordance with SAB 118, to the extent a registrant can reasonably estimate the effects of the Tax Act, a provisional tax amount can be recorded, but must be finalized prior to December 22, 2018. Further analysis is necessary to finalize our accumulated unremitted international earnings subject to the U.S. federal deemed repatriation tax. In addition, since we are still evaluating whether and to what extent we will utilize our net operating loss carryforwards against the transition tax liability, our U.S. deferred tax assets or liabilities may be impacted. Therefore, we consider our accounting related to the Tax Act for U.S. federal and state income taxes as well as international withholding taxes to be provisional. As we refine our estimates and continue to evaluate the Tax Act, we will adjust our provision for income taxes in the period when a change in estimate occurs (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. To date, we have been audited in several taxing jurisdictions with no significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more likely than not outcomes or we may adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. •Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient's service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance ""contingency"") which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and 43forecasted operating results. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes charges amounting to $10.6 million, $20.7 million and $22.6 million, respectively, representing the impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share units. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements - See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details, which is incorporated into this Item 7 by reference thereto. 44Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates. Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-related services. Specifically, reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked through our OTC brands by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through our OTC brands by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. Our non-OTC brands (KAYAK and OpenTable) have different business metrics from those of our OTC brands and therefore search queries through KAYAK and restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not contribute to our gross bookings. Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeAgency$69,697 $58,638 18.9%Merchant11,529 9,449 22.0%Total$81,225 $68,087 19.3% Gross bookings increased by 19.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 19%), almost entirely due to growth of 20.9% in accommodation room night reservations. Accommodation ADRs on a constant-currency basis were relatively unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, foreign exchange rate fluctuations slightly benefited gross bookings growth in U.S. Dollars. We believe that unit growth rates and total gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant-currency basis, each of which exclude the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Agency gross bookings increased by 18.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, almost entirely due to the growth in gross bookings from Booking.com agency retail accommodation room night reservations.Merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Merchant gross bookings increased by 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately 91% of the increase was due to growth in gross bookings from our merchant accommodation reservation services for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Growth in our merchant gross bookings from rental car reservation services and airline ticket reservation services also contributed to this growth. 45Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeRoom Nights673.1 556.6 20.9 %Rental Car Days73.0 66.6 9.6 %Airline Tickets6.9 7.3 (5.3)% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 20.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to strong execution by our brand teams to add new properties to our accommodation reservation services, advertise our brands to consumers and provide a continuously improving experience for customers on our desktop and mobile platforms, as well as the ongoing shift from offline to online for travel bookings. Rental car day reservations increased by 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to strong execution by our brand teams to advertise our brands to consumers and provide a continuously improving experience for customers on our desktop and mobile platforms, as well as the ongoing shift from offline to online for travel bookings.Airline ticket reservations decreased by 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a decline in priceline.com's retail airline ticket reservations and the discontinuation on September 1, 2016 of priceline.com’s Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservation offering, partially offset by an increase in priceline.com's Express Deals® airline ticket reservation offering. RevenuesWe classify our revenue into three categories: •Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Agency revenues consist primarily of travel reservation commissions, as well as certain GDS reservation booking fees and certain travel insurance fees, and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Substantially all of the revenue for Booking.com is agency revenue comprised of accommodation reservation commissions. •Merchant revenues are derived from services where we facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged to us by travel service providers) and travel reservation commissions in connection with (a) the accommodation reservations provided through our merchant retail accommodation reservation services at agoda.com, Booking.com and priceline.com, (b) the reservations provided through our merchant rental car service at Rentalcars.com, and (c) the reservations provided through priceline.com’s Express Deals® reservation services; (2) ancillary fees, including damage excess waiver fees and certain travel insurance fees and certain GDS reservation booking fees; (3) transaction revenues representing the price of Name Your Own Price® reservations charged to a customer (with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues); and (4) customer processing fees charged in connection with (a) the merchant retail accommodation reservation services at priceline.com and agoda.com and (b) priceline.com's opaque reservation services. •Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (1) revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps; (2) revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) reservation fees (fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service) and (b) subscription fees earned by OpenTable for restaurant reservation management services; (3) revenues earned by priceline.com for advertising on its websites; and (4) revenues generated by Booking.com's BookingSuite branded accommodation marketing and business analytics services. 46 Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 ChangeAgency Revenues$9,714,126 $7,982,116 21.7%Merchant Revenues2,133,017 2,048,005 4.2%Advertising and Other Revenues833,939 712,885 17.0%Total Revenues$12,681,082 $10,743,006 18.0%Agency RevenuesAgency revenues increased by 21.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, almost entirely due to the growth in agency accommodation room night reservations at Booking.com. Merchant RevenuesMerchant revenues increased by 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in our merchant price-disclosed accommodation and rental car reservation services, mostly offset by a significant decrease in revenues from priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. On September 1, 2016, priceline.com’s Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservation offering was discontinued. Our priceline.com Name Your Own Price® reservation services, which declined year-over-year, are recorded ""gross"" in revenue with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues. Our other merchant revenues, which in total grew year-over-year, are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs. As a result, changes in Name Your Own Price® reservation revenue disproportionately affect merchant revenues as compared to our other merchant revenues. Advertising and Other RevenuesAdvertising and other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of advertising revenues, restaurant reservation revenues and subscription revenues for restaurant reservation management services. Advertising and other revenues increased by 17.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of the Momondo Group revenue amounting to approximately $72 million since its acquisition on July 24, 2017, other growth in our KAYAK business and increased diner reservation volumes at OpenTable. Cost of Revenues Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 ChangeCost of Revenues$250,537 $428,314 (41.5)% For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost paid to travel service providers for priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® and vacation package reservation services, net of applicable taxes and charges; and (2) fees paid to third parties by KAYAK and priceline.com to return travel itinerary information for consumer search queries. Cost of revenues decreased by 41.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of revenues benefited from a reversal of previously accrued travel transaction taxes of approximately $12 million (including estimated interest and penalties) recorded in December 2017 related to a favorable ruling in one of the travel transaction tax proceedings involving the Company.Agency revenues have no cost of revenues. 47Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 ChangeGross Profit$12,430,545 $10,314,692 20.5%Gross Margin98.0% 96.0% Total gross profit increased by 20.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 19%). Gross profit from our accommodation reservation services contributed approximately 90% of the increase. In addition, the inclusion of the Momondo Group since its acquisition on July 24, 2017 contributed approximately $72 million of gross profit. Total gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Name Your Own Price® reservation services are recorded ""gross"" in revenue with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in the year ended December 31, 2017 these revenues represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in the year ended December 31, 2016. Our price-disclosed reservation services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs, have been growing and priceline.com's Name Your Own Price® reservation services have been declining. As a result, we believe that gross profit is an important measure for evaluating growth in our business.Gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is due in part to the timing of booking versus travel resulting from the impact of decelerating gross bookings growth in the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as the inclusion of the Momondo Group since its acquisition on July 24, 2017. Our international operations accounted for approximately $11.1 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased by 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 21%). Gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses increased by 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to growth in gross profit for all of our U.S. businesses.Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 ChangePerformance Advertising$4,141,771 $3,479,287 19.0%% of Total Gross Profit33.3% 33.7% Brand Advertising$391,584 $295,698 32.4%% of Total Gross Profit3.2% 2.9% We rely on performance advertising channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. Performance advertising expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; and (4) other performance-based advertisements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, performance advertising expenses increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, to generate increased gross bookings and gross profit. We adjust our performance advertising spend based on our growth and profitability objectives and the expected performance of our performance advertising channels. Performance advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the timing of performance advertising spend relative to when associated revenue is recognized, as well as changes in the share of traffic by channel. In addition, during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, we pursued a strategy of improving our performance advertising ROIs, which positively impacted performance advertising efficiency. We recognize the substantial majority of our performance advertising expenses as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which the associated 48reservations are booked. In contrast, we generally do not recognize revenue from these reservations until the travel occurs, which can be in a quarter other than when the reservations are booked. Brand advertising expenses consist mainly of television advertising, online video advertising (including the airing of our television advertising online) and online display advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2017, brand advertising expenses increased by 32.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased brand advertising by Booking.com, KAYAK, which includes expenses related to the Momondo Group since its acquisition on July 24, 2017, and priceline.com. We increased our brand advertising expense in order to increase awareness of our brands and grow the number of customers that come directly to our websites.Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 ChangeSales and Marketing$561,958 $435,225 29.1%% of Total Gross Profit4.5% 4.2% Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of: (1) credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) promotional costs; (4) customer relations costs; (5) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency accommodation commission receivables; and (6) provisions for customer chargebacks associated with merchant transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to increased transaction volumes, as well as higher promotional costs and higher bad debt expense related to accommodation commission receivables.Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 ChangePersonnel$1,659,581 $1,350,032 22.9%% of Total Gross Profit13.4% 13.1% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, and employee health and other benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in aggregate salaries of approximately $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to headcount growth to support our business. Stock-based compensation expense was $260.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $249.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to higher personnel-related, occupancy and office expenses associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our international businesses, as well as a $27 million litigation-related expense, of which 49$19.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, and higher fees for outside professionals, including professional fees related to our acquisition of the Momondo Group.

Information technology expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of increased depreciation expenses due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion, the inclusion of intangible amortization for the Momondo Group since its acquisition on July 24, 2017, and increased capitalized software development costs.Impairment of Goodwill Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 ChangeImpairment of Goodwill$— $940,700 N/A% of Total Gross ProfitN/A 9.1% During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill related to OpenTable, which is not tax deductible, of $940.7 million (see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 ChangeInterest Income$157,194 $94,946 65.6 %Interest Expense(253,976) (207,900) 22.2 %Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(35,291) (16,913) 108.7 %Impairment of Cost-method Investments(7,597) (63,208) (88.0)%Total$(139,670) $(193,075) (27.7)% 50For the year ended December 31, 2017, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance and higher yields. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to interest expense attributable to our Senior Notes issued in May 2016, March 2017 and August 2017 (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Foreign currency transactions and other includes foreign currency gains or losses on derivative contracts, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, including costs related to foreign currency transactions, and net realized gains or losses on investments. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign currency losses of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to foreign currency gains of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Foreign currency transaction losses, including costs related to foreign currency transactions, resulted in foreign currency losses of $31.2 million and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on impairments of cost-method investments. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$2,057,557 $578,251 255.8%% of Total Earnings Before Income Taxes46.8% 21.3% Our 2017 effective tax rate differs from the 2017 U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to a one-time transition tax of approximately $1.6 billion on mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated unremitted international earnings pursuant to the Tax Act, which includes U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by (1) a net tax benefit of approximately $217 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and (2) lower international tax rates. Our 2016 effective tax rate differs from the 2016 U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to lower international tax rates, partially offset by the non-deductible impairment charge for goodwill of $940.7 million related to OpenTable recognized in 2016 (see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) and the non-deductible impairment charge of approximately $60 million associated with a cost-method investment recognized in 2016 (see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is higher than our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to the net tax expense resulting from the Tax Act, partially offset by an increased proportion of our income being taxed at lower international tax rates due to the growth of our international businesses and the non-deductible impairment charges recognized in 2016 referred to above that caused an increase in the 2016 effective tax rate.A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment under Dutch tax law, which had a significant beneficial impact on the Company's effective tax rate for those periods. While we expect Booking.com to continue to qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatment with respect to a portion of its earnings for the foreseeable future, the loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit, whether due to a change in tax law or a determination by the Dutch government that Booking.com's activities are not ""innovative"" or for any other reason, would substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations. During December 2017, legislation was enacted in the Netherlands that increased the Innovation Box Tax rate from 5% to 7%, effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We may not be able to maintain our 'Innovation Box Tax' benefit."" 51Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 Operating and Statistical Metrics Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 ChangeAgency$58,638 $47,969 22.2%Merchant9,449 7,559 25.0%Total$68,087 $55,528 22.6% Gross bookings increased by 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 25%), principally due to growth of 28.7% in accommodation room night reservations and growth of 11.2% in rental car day reservations, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, a slight decrease in accommodation ADRs (the decline on a constant-currency basis was less than 1%) and decreases in airfares and airline ticket reservations. We believe that unit growth rates and total gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant-currency basis, each of which exclude the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Agency gross bookings increased by 22.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to growth in gross bookings from Booking.com agency retail accommodation room night reservations.Merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Merchant gross bookings increased by 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to growth in gross bookings from the merchant accommodation reservation services for Booking.com and agoda.com, the merchant rental car reservation service for Rentalcars.com and the merchant airline ticket reservation service for priceline.com.Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 ChangeRoom Nights556.6 432.3 28.7 %Rental Car Days66.6 59.9 11.2 %Airline Tickets7.3 7.7 (5.2)% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to strong execution by our brand teams to add accommodations to our websites, advertise our brands to consumers and provide a continuously improving experience for customers on our desktop and mobile platforms. Rental car day reservations increased by 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an increase in rental car day reservations for Rentalcars.com.Airline ticket reservations decreased by 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a decline in priceline.com's retail airline ticket reservations and the discontinuation on September 1, 522016 of priceline.com’s Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservation offering, partially offset by an increase in priceline.com's Express Deals® airline ticket reservations.

Gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is due in part to the timing of booking versus travel resulting from the impact of accelerating gross bookings growth in the year ended December 31, 2016 and an expanding booking window (a lengthening of the average time between the making of a travel reservation and the travel). Other contributing factors to the variance are business mix impacts and the use of discounted closed user group rates.Our international operations accounted for approximately $9.1 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to increased transaction volumes and a higher provision for customer chargebacks associated with merchant transactions.Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangePersonnel$1,350,032 $1,166,226 15.8%% of Total Gross Profit13.1% 13.6% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes, and employee health and other benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 552016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to increased headcount to support the growth of our businesses. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeGeneral and Administrative$455,909 $415,420 9.7%% of Total Gross Profit4.4% 4.8% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) personnel-related expenses such as travel, recruiting and training expenses; and (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to higher occupancy and office expenses related to the expansion of our international businesses, higher fees for outside professionals and higher personnel-related expenses related to increased headcount in our businesses. These increases were partially offset by $7.7 million of expense recognized in 2015 for a fair value adjustment to the contingent liability related to an acquisition.Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeInformation Technology$142,393 $113,617 25.3%% of Total Gross Profit1.4% 1.3% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; (3) outsourced data center costs; and (4) payments to outside consultants. Information technology expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeDepreciation and Amortization$309,135 $272,494 13.4%% of Total Gross Profit3.0% 3.2% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation on computer equipment; (3) depreciation of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased depreciation expenses due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion, as well as increased capitalized software development costs. 56Impairment of Goodwill Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeImpairment of Goodwill$940,700 $— N/A% of Total Gross Profit9.1% N/A During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill related to OpenTable, which is not tax deductible, of $940.7 million (see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeInterest Income$94,946 $55,729 70.4 %Interest Expense(207,900) (160,229) 29.8 %Foreign Currency Transactions and Other(16,913) (26,087) (35.2)%Impairment of Cost-method Investments(63,208) — N/ATotal$(193,075) $(130,587) 47.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance and higher yields. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to interest expense attributable to our Senior Notes issued in March 2015, November 2015 and May 2016, partially offset by the maturity of our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes in March 2015. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.""Foreign currency transactions and other"" includes foreign currency gains or losses on derivative contracts, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, including costs related to foreign currency transactions, and net realized gains or losses on investments. Derivative contracts that hedge our exposure to the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of our international operating results into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation resulted in foreign currency gains of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to foreign currency losses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.Foreign currency transaction losses, including costs related to foreign currency transactions, resulted in foreign currency losses of $19.6 million and $21.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign currency losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included approximately $5.7 million of hedging cost and a foreign currency loss related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on impairments of cost-method investments.Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 ChangeIncome Tax Expense$578,251 $576,960 0.2%% of Total Earnings Before Income Taxes21.3% 18.4% Our 2016 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to lower international tax rates, partially offset by the non-deductible impairment charge for goodwill of $940.7 million related to OpenTable recognized in 2016 (see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) and the non-deductible impairment charge associated with a cost- 57method investment recognized in 2016 (see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Our 2015 effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate as a result of lower international tax rates, partially offset by U.S. state income taxes. The non-deductible impairment charges referred to above have caused our effective tax rate to be higher for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase has been partially offset by the favorable impact of an increased proportion of our income being taxed at lower international tax rates due to the growth of our international businesses and the tax benefits recorded in 2016 arising from U.S. state tax law changes resulting in a net decrease to deferred tax liabilities, mostly associated with acquired intangible assets. 58Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2017, we had $17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments. Approximately $16.2 billion is held by our international subsidiaries and is denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, Euros and, to a lesser extent, British Pounds Sterling and other currencies. Cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments are comprised of U.S. and international corporate bonds, U.S. and international government securities, high-grade commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, convertible debt securities and American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") of Ctrip, money market funds and time deposits (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).In the first quarter of 2018, 2017 and 2016, we prepaid a portion of our Dutch income tax liability of approximately $713 million, $500 million and $431 million, respectively, to earn prepayment discounts. As a result of the Tax Act (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we have recorded a provisional transition tax liability of approximately $1.3 billion, inclusive of U.S. federal and state income taxes and international withholding taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, net of the benefit of utilizing approximately $204 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately $46 million of other U.S. tax credit carryforwards. This tax liability is presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017 as ""Long-term U.S. transition tax liability,"" the majority of which is U.S. federal income tax and will be paid over eight years.In accordance with the Tax Act, generally future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes. In October 2017, we invested $450 million in preferred shares of Meituan-Dianping. On July 24, 2017, we acquired the Momondo Group for $555.5 million. In August 2017, we issued Senior Notes due March 15, 2023, with an interest rate of 2.75% (the ""2023 Notes""), and Senior Notes due March 15, 2028, with an interest rate of 3.55% (the ""2028 Notes""), each having an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Interest on the 2023 Notes and the 2028 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, beginning March 15, 2018. In March 2017, we issued Senior Notes due March 10, 2022, with an interest rate of 0.8% (the ""March 2022 Notes"") for an aggregate principal amount of 1.0 billion Euros. Interest on the March 2022 Notes is payable annually on March 10, beginning March 10, 2018. The net proceeds of these notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include share repurchases, repayment of debt and acquisitions. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the 2023 Notes, 2028 Notes and March 2022 Notes.In June 2015, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.50%; or (ii) the greatest of (a) Bank of America, N.A.'s prime lending rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) an adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.085% to 0.20%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $70.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $50.0 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding and approximately $3.8 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. Our Convertible Senior Notes due March 15, 2018, with an interest rate of 1.0% (the ""2018 Notes""), are currently convertible and will remain convertible until the trading day prior to the maturity date of March 15, 2018, regardless of the Company's stock price. We reported the carrying value of the 2018 Notes as a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017. We are required to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes of approximately $714 million in cash, and, in addition, we have elected to deliver cash of approximately $700 million (based on our stock closing price of February 26, 2018) to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the remaining aggregate principal amount.During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 1,025,890 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2017, we had a remaining aggregate amount of $2.4 billion authorized by our Board of Directors to purchase our common stock. We may from time to time make additional repurchases of our common stock, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. During the period from January 1, 2018 59through February 20, 2018, we repurchased 185,620 additional shares for an aggregate cost of $345.5 million. In the first quarter of 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $8.0 billion of our common stock.In September 2016, we signed a turnkey agreement to construct an office building in the Netherlands for the future headquarters of Booking.com for approximately 270 million Euros. Upon signing the agreement, we paid approximately 48 million Euros to the developer, principally related to acquired land-use rights, and we expect to pay approximately 34 million Euros related to building construction in the first quarter of 2018, with the remaining amount being paid periodically from the second quarter of 2018 until the expected completion of the building in early 2021. We will also make additional capital expenditures to fit out and furnish the office space. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $4.7 billion, resulting from net income of $2.3 billion, a favorable impact of $742.9 million for non-cash items and net favorable changes in working capital of $293.4 million and in other assets and liabilities of $1.3 billion, which is principally related to the long-term transition tax liability recognized as a result of the U.S. Tax Act (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017, were primarily related to a $687.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $269.7 million increase in accounts receivable and $124.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were principally associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of debt discount.Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $4.0 billion, resulting from net income of $2.1 billion, a favorable impact of $1.6 billion for non-cash items and net favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $213.9 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2016, were primarily related to a $514.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $284.2 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were principally associated with impairment of goodwill, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of cost-method investments, excess tax benefits on stock-based awards and other equity deductions, amortization of debt discount and deferred income taxes.Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $3.2 billion, resulting from net income of $2.6 billion and a favorable impact of $660.4 million for non-cash items, partially offset by net unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $8.2 million. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2015, were primarily related to a $166.0 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $68.7 million increase in accounts receivable and $81.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volumes. Non-cash items were primarily associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, excess tax benefits on stock-based awards and other equity deductions, amortization of debt discount and deferred income taxes. Net cash used in investing activities was $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, principally resulting from net purchases of investments of $2.9 billion and acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, of $1.0 billion. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, principally resulting from net purchases of investments of $3.1 billion and $48.5 million for the acquisition of land-use rights related to the construction of Booking.com's new headquarters in the Netherlands. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, principally resulting from net purchases of investments of $3.6 billion, $140.3 million used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by net proceeds of $5.2 million for the settlement of foreign currency contracts. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment was $287.8 million, $219.9 million and $173.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increases for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were related to additional data center capacity and new offices to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com and agoda.com brands in 2017 and 2016 and principally related to our Booking.com brand in 2015. Net cash used in financing activities was $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily consisted of payments for repurchase of common stock of $1.8 billion, payments related to the conversion of Senior Notes of $285.7 million and payment of debt of $15.1 million assumed in the acquisition of the Momondo Group, partially offset by net proceeds of $2.0 billion from the issuance of Senior Notes and the exercise of employee stock options of $5.1 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which primarily consisted of payments for repurchase of common stock of $1.0 billion, offset by net proceeds of $994.7 million from the issuance of Senior Notes and the exercise of employee stock options of $15.6 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $831.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which primarily consisted of payments for repurchase of common stock of $3.1 billion, 60payments of $147.6 million related to the conversion of Senior Notes and payment of $10.7 million related to the settlement of the acquisition-date estimated contingent liability related to an acquisition, partially offset by the total proceeds of $2.4 billion from the issuance of Senior Notes and the exercise of employee stock options of $20.9 million.ContingenciesFrench tax authorities conducted an audit of the years 2003 through 2012 to determine whether Booking.com is in compliance with its tax obligations in France. Booking.com received formal assessments in December 2015 in which the French tax authorities claim that Booking.com has a permanent establishment in France and seek to recover unpaid income taxes and value-added taxes of approximately 356 million Euros, the majority of which would represent penalties and interest. We believe that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with French tax law and we are contesting the assessments. Our objection to the assessment was denied by the French tax authorities. If we are unable to resolve the matter with the French tax authorities, we would expect to challenge the assessments in the French courts. In order to contest the assessments in court, we may be required to pay, upfront, the full amount or a significant part of any such assessments, though such payment would not constitute an admission by us that we owes the taxes. Alternatively, any resolution or settlement of the matter with the French tax authorities may also require payment as part of such resolution or settlement. In each case, any such payment would not necessarily constitute an admission by us that we owe the taxes. French tax authorities have begun a similar audit of the tax years 2013 through 2015, which could result in additional assessments. See Part I Item IA Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""A number of U.S. jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against online travel companies, including us, related to, among other things, the payment of travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.). In addition, a number of U.S. states, counties and municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of travel transaction taxes. For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Adverse application of U.S. state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations."" in this Annual Report.As a result of this litigation and other attempts by U.S. jurisdictions to levy similar taxes, we have established an accrual (including estimated interest and penalties) for the potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes in the amount of approximately $12 million and $27 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The accrual is based on our estimate of the probable cost of resolving these issues. Our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued. The actual cost may be less or greater, potentially significantly, than the liability recorded. An estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued cannot be reasonably made. If we were to suffer adverse determinations in the near term in more of the pending proceedings than currently anticipated given results to date, because of our available cash we believe that it would not have a material impact on our liquidity.The following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017: Payments due by Period (in thousands)Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations(1) $686,277 $148,200 $255,565 $138,608 $143,904Land lease obligation(1) 71,194 1,499 2,998 2,998 63,699Building construction obligation(1) 265,702 91,852 154,908 18,942 —Senior Notes(2) 11,031,124 895,228 1,352,955 2,239,305 6,543,636Revolving credit facility(3) 6,909 3,187 3,722 — —Earnout - acquisition 9,170 — 9,170 — —U.S. transition tax liability 1,257,191 6,345 306,016 203,758 741,072Total(4) $13,327,567 $1,146,311 $2,085,334 $2,603,611 $7,492,311(1)See the section on ""Operating Leases"" and ""Building Construction"" section of Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2)Represents the aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and cumulative interest to maturity of $1.3 billion. Convertible debt does not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding 61principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or shares of common stock at our option. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.(3)Represents fees on uncommitted funds and outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2017.(4)We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $148 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017, of which approximately $66 million related to deferred rents, approximately $28 million related to unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) and approximately $12 million related to our accrual for the potential resolution of issues related to travel transaction taxes (see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for the liabilities related to travel transaction taxes and unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Therefore, we have excluded long-term liabilities of $139 million from the contractual obligations table above because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments or the liability is related to deferred rents, which represents the difference in rent expense recognized in the income statements and rent payments related to operating leases. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use currency exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2017. Fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our available-for-sale investments assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments as of December 31, 2017 of approximately $206 million. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity. This amount excludes our investment in Ctrip.com International Ltd. (""Ctrip"") senior convertible notes, which are more sensitive to the market price volatility of Ctrip's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") than changes in interest rates. The fair value of our Ctrip senior 62convertible notes will most likely increase as the market price of Ctrip's ADSs increases and decrease as the market price of Ctrip's ADSs falls. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was approximately $9.7 billion. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $11.1 billion as of December 31, 2017. A substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount relates to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible notes.We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euro). As a result, we face exposures to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the operating results of our international operations are translated from local currencies into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currencies. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, result in gains and losses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.As a result of currency exchange rate changes, our foreign-currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses and net income have been positively impacted as expressed in U.S. Dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. The aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated long-term debt, and accrued interest thereon, provide a natural hedge against the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of certain of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries.From time to time, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. Our derivative contracts principally address foreign currency fluctuation risk for the Euro, British Pound Sterling and certain other currencies versus the U.S. Dollar. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no such outstanding derivative contracts. Foreign currency losses of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, foreign currency gains of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and foreign currency losses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 were recorded in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.",2023-12-30 18:44:27.596667

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include those discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.OverviewOur mission is to help people experience the world. We aim to achieve our mission to help people experience the world through global leadership in online travel and restaurant reservation and related services by:•providing consumers with the best choices and prices at any time, in any place, on any device;•making it easy for people to find, book and experience their travel desires; and•providing platforms, tools and insights to our business partners to help them be successful.We operate six primary brands: •Booking.com - the world’s leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations, based on room nights booked.•KAYAK - a leading online meta-search service allowing consumers to easily search and compare travel itineraries and prices, including airline ticket, accommodation and rental car reservation information, from hundreds of travel websites at once. •priceline - a leading hotel, rental car, airline ticket and vacation package online reservation service in North America.•agoda - a leading online accommodation reservation service catering primarily to consumers in the Asia-Pacific region.•Rentalcars.com - a leading online worldwide rental car reservation service.•OpenTable - a leading online provider of restaurant reservation and information services to consumers and restaurant reservation management and customer acquisition services to restaurants.Our results include the Momondo Group, FareHarbor and HotelsCombined since they were acquired in July 2017, April 2018 and November 2018, respectively. We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands collectively as ""Booking Holdings,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us.""Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda and Rentalcars.com and the international businesses of KAYAK and OpenTable. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the United States is part of our international results. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 89% of our consolidated revenues. A significant majority of our revenues, including a significant majority of our international revenues, is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.We derive substantially all of our revenues and, prior to January 1, 2018, gross profit from the following sources:•Commissions earned from facilitating reservations of accommodations, rental cars and other travel services on an agency basis;•Travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues, credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees, in each case in connection with our merchant transactions; 36•Advertising revenues primarily earned by KAYAK from sending referrals to online travel companies (""OTCs"") and travel service providers, as well as from advertising placements on KAYAK's platforms;•Reservation revenues paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation services, subscription fees for restaurant reservation management services provided by OpenTable; and•Ancillary revenues including travel insurance-related revenues and global distribution system (""GDS"") reservation booking fees, in each case related to certain of our travel services.Our priceline brand offers merchant Name Your Own Price® opaque travel services, which were previously recorded in revenue on a ""gross"" basis with the amount remitted to the travel service providers reported as cost of revenues. Under the current revenue recognition accounting standard (""the current revenue standard""), Name Your Own Price® revenues are reported on a net basis with the amount remitted to the travel service providers recorded as an offset in merchant revenues. Therefore, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, we no longer present ""Cost of revenues"" or ""Gross profit"" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total revenues for periods beginning after December 31, 2017 are comparable to gross profit reported in prior periods. For further information on the adoption of the current revenue standard, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.TrendsOver the last several years we have experienced significant growth in our accommodation reservation services. We believe this growth is the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the widespread adoption of mobile devices and the growth of travel overall, including in higher growth emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and South America. We also believe this growth is the result of the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to increase the number and the variety of accommodations we offer our travelers, increase and improve content, build distribution and improve the consumer experience on our online platforms, as well as consistently and effectively marketing our brands through performance and brand marketing efforts. These year-over-year growth rates have generally decelerated. Given the size of our accommodation reservation business, we expect that our year-over-year growth rates will generally continue to decelerate, though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate and there may be periods of acceleration from time to time. Our international business represents the substantial majority of our financial results, and we expect our operating results and other financial metrics to continue to be largely driven by international performance. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States, and recent international online travel growth rates have exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. Over the long term, we expect that international online travel growth rates will slow, similarly to the trend experienced in the United States. In addition, the base of hotel properties in Europe and Asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the leading online accommodation reservation service provider in the world as measured by room nights booked. We believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the markets in which we operate.Our growth has primarily been generated by our worldwide accommodation reservation service brand, Booking.com, which is our most significant brand, and has been due, in part, to the availability of a large and growing number of instantly bookable properties through Booking.com. Booking.com included approximately 2,180,000 properties on its website at December 31, 2018, consisting of approximately 436,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 1,744,000 homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, compared to approximately 1,586,000 properties (including approximately 396,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 1,190,000 homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay) at December 31, 2017. Booking.com categorizes properties listed on its website as either (a) hotels, motels and resorts, which groups together more traditional accommodation types (including hostels and inns), or (b) homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, also referred to as alternative accommodations, which encompasses all other types of accommodations, including bed and breakfasts, villas, apart-hotels and beyond. We intend to continue to invest in adding accommodations available for reservation on our platforms, such as hotels, motels, resorts, homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, however the growth rate of our accommodations may vary in part as a result of removing accommodations from our platforms from time to time. Many of the newer accommodations we add to our travel reservation services, especially in highly-penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms or higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of consumers (e.g., hostels and bed and breakfasts). Because alternative accommodations are often either a single unit or a small collection of independent units, these properties generally represent more limited booking opportunities than hotels, motels and resorts, which generally have more units to rent per property. Further, alternative 37accommodations in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism seasons, weather or other factors or may not be available at peak times due to use by the property owners. We may also experience lower profit margins with respect to these properties due to certain additional costs, such as increased customer service costs, related to offering these accommodations on our platforms. As we increase our alternative accommodation business, these different characteristics could negatively impact our profit margins; and, to the extent these properties represent an increasing percentage of the properties added to our platforms, we expect that our gross bookings growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time (since each such property has fewer booking opportunities). As a result of the foregoing, as the percentage of alternative accommodation properties increases, the number of reservations per property will likely continue to decrease. We believe that continuing to expand the number and variety of accommodations available through our services, in particular Booking.com, will help us to continue to grow our accommodation reservation business.As part of our strategy to provide more payment options to our customers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com and enable the growth of our in-destination activities businesses, Booking.com is increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis, where it receives payments on behalf of customers. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer secure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that adding these types of service offerings will benefit our customers and partners, as well as our gross bookings, room night and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional expenses for personnel, payment processing, customer chargebacks (including those related to fraud) and other expenses related to these transactions, which are recorded in ""Personnel"" and ""Sales and other expenses"" in our Statements of Operations, as well as associated incremental revenues in the form of credit card rebates, for example, which are recorded in ""Merchant revenues."" As this business continues to grow, we may experience a significant increase in these expenses that may not be fully offset by an increase in associated incremental revenues, which would negatively impact our operating margins.We compete globally with both online and traditional providers of travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data and financial and other resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market, including by establishing a flight meta-search product (Google Flights) and a hotel meta-search product (Google Hotel Ads) that are growing rapidly, as well as its ""Book on Google"" reservation functionality and its Google Trips app. Our markets are also subject to rapidly changing conditions, including technological developments, consumer behavior changes, regulatory changes and travel service provider consolidation. We expect these trends to continue. For example, we have experienced a significant shift of both direct and indirect business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Advertising and distribution opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes. In addition, the revenue earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay, have lower ADRs and are not made as far in advance. For more detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face, see Part I Item 1 Business - ""Competition,"" Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance."" and ""Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates new challenges and may enable device companies such as Google and Apple to compete directly with us."" and ""We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes."" Although we believe that providing an extensive collection of properties, excellent customer service and an intuitive, easy-to-use consumer experience are important factors influencing a consumer's decision to make a reservation, for many consumers, particularly in certain markets, the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether a consumer will book a reservation. As a result, it is increasingly important to offer travel services, such as accommodation reservations, at competitive prices, whether through discounts, coupons, closed-user group rates or loyalty programs, or otherwise. These initiatives may result in lower revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. Discounting and couponing coupled with a high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in Asian markets. In some cases, our competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction, or offer travel services at a loss, in order to gain market share.We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Both our performance and brand marketing expenses have increased significantly in recent years, and we expect our performance and brand marketing expenses to continue to increase. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our total performance marketing expense was approximately $4.4 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our websites. Growth of some of these channels has slowed. We also invested $509 million, $435 million 38and $327 million in brand marketing for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing television advertising, online video advertising (for example, on YouTube and Facebook), online display advertising and other brand marketing. We intend to continue a strategy of promoting brand awareness through both online and offline marketing efforts, including by expanding brand campaigns into additional markets, which may significantly increase our brand marketing expenses. We have observed increased brand marketing by OTCs, meta-search services and travel service providers, which may make our brand marketing efforts more expensive and less effective.Performance marketing efficiency, expressed as performance marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues in 2018 or as a percentage of gross profit in 2017, is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are, in some cases, outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers and the extent to which consumers come directly to our websites or mobile apps for bookings. For example, competition for desired rankings in search results and/or a decline in ad clicks by consumers could increase our costs per click and reduce our performance marketing efficiency. In recent years, we experienced significant increases in our cancellation rates, which negatively affected our marketing efficiency and results of operations. More recently our cancellation rates have decreased, which has benefited our marketing efficiency and results of operations. We believe that many factors influence cancellation rates, and it is uncertain whether future cancellation rates will continue to decrease, stabilize or continue their prior trend of generally increasing over time. Further, cancellation rates could vary period to period without following a discernible trend. Changes by Google in how it presents travel search results, including by placing its own offerings at or near the top of search results, or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites. Similarly, changes by our other search and meta-search partners in how they present travel search results or the manner in which they conduct the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites. We have observed a long-term trend of decreasing performance marketing returns on investment (""ROIs""), a trend we expect to continue, though the rate of decrease may fluctuate and there may be periods of stable or increasing ROIs from time to time. In addition, we may from time to time, as we did beginning the third quarter of 2017 and continuing through 2018, pursue a strategy of improving our performance marketing ROIs, which could negatively impact growth and positively impact performance marketing efficiency and profitability. When evaluating our performance marketing spend, we consider several factors for each channel, such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incrementality of the traffic we receive and the anticipated repeat rate from a particular platform, as well as other factors. The amount of business we obtain through each performance marketing channel is impacted by numerous factors, including bidding decisions by us and our competitors (including decisions to optimize performance marketing ROIs) and the marketing efforts and success of those channels to attract consumers and generate demand. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We rely on performance and brand marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites and grow our business."" and ""Our business could be negatively affected by changes in internet search and meta-search algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.""Perceived or actual adverse economic conditions, including slow, slowing or negative economic growth, high or rising unemployment rates, inflation and weakening currencies, and concerns over government responses such as higher taxes or tariffs and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. Further, political uncertainty, conditions or events, such as the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (""Brexit""), including uncertainty or delays in the implementation of Brexit and concerns regarding certain E.U. members with sovereign debt default risks can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. At times, we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates, increased cancellation rates and weaker trends in hotel average daily rates (""ADRs"") across many regions of the world, particularly in those countries that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainties, which we believe are due at least in part to these macro-economic conditions and concerns. For more detail, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""These and other macro-economic uncertainties, such as geopolitical tensions and differing central bank monetary policies, have led to significant volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and other currencies. Significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, stock markets and oil prices can also impact consumer travel behavior. As noted earlier, our international business represents a substantial majority of our financial results. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our international businesses are translated from local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. As a result, both the absolute amounts of and percentage changes in our foreign- 39currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars are affected by currency exchange rate changes. Our foreign-currency-denominated gross bookings, revenues and operating expenses as expressed in U.S. Dollars are higher for the year ended December 31, 2018 than they would have been had foreign exchange rates remained where they were for the year ended December 31, 2017. For example, total revenues in 2018 compared to gross profit in 2017 from our international operations grew 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, but, without the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, grew year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 17%. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. The aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated long-term debt, and accrued interest thereon, provide a hedge against the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of certain of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). For more information, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.""We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated operating results into U.S. Dollars. However, such derivative instruments are short-term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuations that could impact growth rates for our gross bookings or revenues (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts).Many national governments have conducted or are conducting investigations into competitive practices within the online travel industry, and we may be involved or affected by such investigations and their results. Some countries have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practices within the online travel industry. For example, France and Italy, among others, have adopted legislation making all price parity agreements illegal and similar legislation is under consideration in other countries. Also, a number of governments are investigating or conducting information-gathering exercises in respect of compliance by OTCs with consumer protection laws, including practices related to the display of search results and search ranking algorithms, claims regarding discounts, disclosure of charges and availability, and similar messaging. For more information on these investigations and their potential effects on our business, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""As the size of our business grows, we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti-trust, competition and consumer protection regulators."" In addition to the price parity and consumer protection investigations, from time to time national competition authorities, other governmental agencies, trade associations and private parties take legal actions, including commencing legal proceedings, that may affect our operations. For example, in March 2017, in connection with a lawsuit begun in 2015 by the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies claiming that Booking.com is required to meet certain registration requirements in Turkey, a Turkish court ordered Booking.com to suspend offering Turkish hotels and accommodations to Turkish residents. Although Booking.com is appealing the order and believes it to be without basis, this order has had a negative impact on our growth and results of operations, and is expected to continue to negatively impact our results of operations. In general, increased regulatory focus on online businesses, including online travel businesses like ours, could result in increased compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. SeasonalityA meaningful amount of our gross bookings is generated early in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. However, historically we generally have not recognized revenue from these bookings until the travel is completed (at ""check-out"") or for periods beginning after December 31, 2017 when the travel begins (at ""check-in"") as a result of the adoption of the current revenue standard (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), which, in either case, can be in a quarter other than when the reservation is booked. In contrast, we expense the substantial majority of our marketing activities as the expense is incurred, which, in the case of performance marketing in particular, is typically in the quarter in which associated reservations are booked. As a result of this potential timing difference between when we record marketing expense and when we recognize associated revenue, we experience our highest levels of profitability in the third quarter of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of accommodation check-ins for the year for our European and North American businesses. The first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience additional volatility in earnings growth rates due to these seasonal timing factors. For our Asia-Pacific business, we experience the highest levels of accommodation bookings in the third and fourth quarters of the year, and the highest levels of accommodation check-ins in the fourth quarter. As the relative growth rates for our businesses fluctuate, the quarterly distribution of our operating results may vary.For several years, we experienced an expansion of the booking window (the average time between the making of a travel reservation and the travel), which impacts the relationship between our gross bookings (recognized at the time of booking) and our revenues (recognized at the time of check-out or, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, at the time of check-in). However, in 2018, we saw a contraction of the booking window. Future changes in the length of the booking 40window will affect the degree to which our gross bookings and revenues occur in the same period and, as a result, whether our gross bookings growth rates and revenue growth rates converge or diverge.In addition, the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results. For example, in 2017, our second quarter year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were positively impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, as it did in 2016. Conversely, our first quarter 2017 year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were adversely impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, as it did in 2016. Similar to 2017, in 2018 Easter fell in the second quarter instead of the first quarter. However, because Easter was on April 1, 2018 and a meaningful amount of Easter travel commenced in the week leading up to Easter (i.e., during the first quarter), Easter had a positive effect on our first quarter 2018 year-over-year growth rates and had a negative effect on our second quarter 2018 year-over-year growth rates primarily due to the change in our revenue recognition policy from ""check-out"" to ""check-in."" In 2019, Easter will be on April 21, and the associated Easter-related travel will generally begin in the second quarter of 2019. As a result, the shift in timing of Easter, relative to 2018, will have a negative effect on our year-over-year growth rates in the first quarter of 2019 and a positive effect on our year-over-year growth rates in the second quarter of 2019. The timing of other holidays such as Ramadan can also impact our quarterly year-over-year growth rates.The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business. For example, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable marketing expense. In addition, revenue growth is typically less impacted by decelerating gross bookings growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters, but any such deceleration would negatively impact revenue growth in subsequent periods. Conversely, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate accelerates, our operating margins are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable marketing expense. In addition, revenue growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term, but any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent periods as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters.Other FactorsWe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel and travel-related services. Factors beyond our control, such as oil prices, stock market volatility, terrorist attacks, unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, fires, droughts and volcanic eruptions, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Zika and MERS, political instability, changes in economic conditions, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes, tarriffs or surcharges by regulatory authorities, changes in trade policies or trade disputes, changes in immigration policies or travel-related accidents, can disrupt travel, limit the ability or willingness of travelers to visit certain locations or otherwise result in declines in travel demand. Because these events or concerns, and the full impact of their effects, are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services, which can adversely affect our business and results of operations. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. We have experienced pressure on operating margins as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, acquisitions. As the overall size of our business has grown, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of services and technologies, including services and technologies that may be outside of our historical core business, and our ability to keep pace may slow. Potential competitors, such as emerging start-ups, may be able to innovate and focus on developing a particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new services or technologies before us. Some of our larger competitors or potential competitors have more resources or more established or diversified relationships with consumers than we do, and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, entering or investing in travel reservation businesses, investing in research and development, and competing aggressively for highly-skilled employees. For example, because consumers often utilize other online services more frequently than online travel services, a competitor or potential competitor that has established other, more frequent online interactions with consumers may be able to more easily or cost-effectively acquire customers for its online travel services than we can. Our goal is to grow revenue and achieve healthy operating margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain and highly competitive environment in which we operate makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth and profitability. 41Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:•Valuation of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets. The application of the acquisition accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair value are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable. When we deem appropriate, we utilize assistance from a third-party valuation firm. The consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amounts allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date.We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. A substantial portion of the Company's intangibles and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable in July 2014 and KAYAK in May 2013. At September 30, 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. Other than OpenTable, the fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values at September 30, 2018. We estimated OpenTable’s fair value using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approaches (EBITDA multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies and precedent transactions). At September 30, 2018, OpenTable's estimated fair value was approximately 13% higher than its carrying value, therefore, there was no impairment to OpenTable's goodwill. Since the annual impairment test, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment to our goodwill. In addition, we did not identify an impairment indicator for our long-lived assets and intangible assets at December 31, 2018.For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill of $941 million related to OpenTable, which was not tax deductible. Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in the current forecast, including key assumptions regarding OpenTable's expected growth rates and operating margins as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates, currency exchange rates and market EBITDA comparables. If OpenTable does not achieve the results currently expected or if any of the assumptions underlying our estimate of the fair value of the OpenTable business prove to be incorrect, we may need to adjust our forecast for the OpenTable business and recognize a goodwill impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""The success of our acquisition of OpenTable is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.""•Income Taxes. We determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. 42The Tax Act also introduced in 2018 a tax on 50% of global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), which is income determined to be in excess of a specified routine rate of return, and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) aimed at preventing the erosion of the U.S. tax base. We have adopted an accounting policy to treat taxes on GILTI as period costs.In December 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") was issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when the registrant does not have all the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. In accordance with SAB 118, to the extent a registrant can reasonably estimate the effects of the Tax Act, a provisional tax amount can be recorded, but must be finalized prior to December 22, 2018. In 2018, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. We recorded an income tax benefit of $46 million to adjust our provisional income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, as well as U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation. In addition, we recorded an income tax benefit of $2 million in 2018 to adjust the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate that resulted from the Tax Act. We utilized $133 million of deferred tax assets related to federal operating loss carryforwards and $23 million of other tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2017 to reduce our transition tax liability. We do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject to U.S. taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to U.S. taxation as GILTI. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. To date, we have been audited in several taxing jurisdictions with no significant impact on our results of operations. After the French tax authorities issued a formal demand for payment of the amounts assessed, in the first quarter of 2019, we paid 356 million Euros to French tax authorities in order to preserve our right to contest the assessments in court (see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Although we believe that our tax filing positions comply with applicable laws, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more-likely-than-not outcomes or we may adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. •Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient's service period based upon the grant-date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance ""contingency"") which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance-based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 includes charges amounting to $48 million, $11 million and $21 million, respectively, representing the impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share units. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements - See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details, which is incorporated into this Item 7 by reference thereto. 43Results of OperationsFor reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2017, the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the current revenue standard adopted on January 1, 2018. The financial statements for all periods prior to January 1, 2018 are presented under the previous revenue recognition accounting standard. In addition, we have changed the presentation of advertising expenses and sales and marketing expenses and reclassified certain expense from ""Cost of revenues"" to ""Sales and other expenses"" or ""General and administrative"" expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 have been conformed to the current period presentation and classification. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Year Ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates. Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-related services. Specifically, reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked through our OTC brands by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through our OTC brands by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. Our non-OTC brands (KAYAK and OpenTable) have different business metrics from those of our OTC brands and therefore search queries through KAYAK and restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not contribute to our gross bookings.Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangeAgency$73,919 $69,697 6.1%Merchant18,812 11,529 63.2%Total$92,731 $81,225 14.2% Gross bookings increased by 14.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 13%), almost entirely due to growth of 12.9% in accommodation room night reservations. Accommodation ADRs on a constant-currency basis were relatively unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, foreign exchange rate fluctuations benefited gross bookings growth in U.S. Dollars. We believe that unit growth rates and growth in total gross bookings on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not receive payments from travelers for the travel services provided. Agency gross bookings increased by 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, almost entirely due to the growth in gross bookings from agency accommodation room night reservations at Booking.com and agoda.Merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we receive payments from travelers for the travel services provided. Merchant gross bookings increased by 63.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended 44December 31, 2017, almost entirely due to growth in gross bookings from our merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com and agoda. Booking.com has been expanding its merchant accommodation reservation services to provide greater payment options for both consumers and travel service providers.Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangeRoom nights760 673 12.9%Rental car days73 73 0.3%Airline tickets7 7 3.8% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to strong execution by our brand teams to increase the accommodation choices we offer our travelers, invest in performance and brand marketing and provide a continuously improving consumer experience, as well as the overall growth in the travel industry and the ongoing shift from offline to online for travel bookings. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was also positively impacted by a decrease in cancellation rates. Rental car day reservations increased by 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase in international rental car day reservations, almost entirely offset by a decrease in U.S. rental car day reservations primarily as a result of rental car supply constraints.Airline ticket reservations increased by 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the benefits of priceline's investments in its flight platform and brand marketing. RevenuesOnline travel reservation servicesSubstantially all of our revenues are generated by providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases between travel service providers and travelers. For periods beginning after December 31, 2017, we recognize revenue for travel reservation services when the travel begins rather than when the travel is completed. For example, once the customer checks in to an accommodation, we record revenues, which are net of sales incentives and expected changes in reservations. In addition, for periods beginning prior to January 1, 2018, revenues from priceline's Name Your Own Price® transactions were presented on a gross basis with the amount remitted to the travel service providers reported as cost of revenues. Under the current revenue standard, Name Your Own Price® revenues are reported on a net basis with the amount remitted to the travel service providers recorded as an offset in merchant revenues. Therefore, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, we no longer present ""Cost of revenues"" or ""Gross profit"" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For further information on the adoption of the current revenue standard, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Revenues from online travel reservation services are classified into two categories: •Agency. Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not receive payments from travelers for the services provided. Agency revenues consist almost entirely of travel reservation commissions, as well as certain GDS reservation booking fees and certain travel insurance fees. Substantially all of our agency revenue is from Booking.com agency accommodation reservations. •Merchant. Merchant revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we receive payments from travelers for the services provided, generally at the time of booking. Merchant revenues include (1) travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our merchant reservation services; (2) ancillary fees, including travel insurance-related revenues and certain GDS reservation booking fees; and (3) credit card processing rebates 45and customer processing fees. Substantially all merchant revenues are for merchant services derived from transactions where travelers book accommodation reservations or rental car reservations from travel service providers. Advertising and other revenuesAdvertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (1) revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on KAYAK's platforms; and (2) revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) restaurant reservation services (fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service) and (b) subscription fees for restaurant management services. Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangeAgency revenues$10,480 $9,714 7.9%Merchant revenues2,987 2,133 Advertising and other revenues1,060 834 27.1%Total revenues$14,527 12,681 Cost of revenues 242 Gross profit $12,439 Agency revenues increased by 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, almost entirely due to growth in agency accommodation room night reservations at Booking.com. Merchant revenues were $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to merchant revenues less cost of revenues of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Revenue from our merchant accommodation reservation services contributed approximately 91% of the year-over-year increase in merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Booking.com has been expanding its merchant accommodation reservation services to provide greater payment options for both customers and travel service providers. Advertising and other revenues increased by 27.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (1) the inclusion of $168 million in revenue related to the Momondo Group for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $72 million in revenue related to the Momondo Group since its acquisition in July 2017 for the year ended December 31, 2017; (2) increased diner reservation revenues at OpenTable; (3) organic growth in our KAYAK business; and (4) a benefit from the reversal of $27 million related to OpenTable's loyalty program liability in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted from the introduction of a three-year time-based expiration for points earned by diners. Total revenues of $14.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to gross profit of $12.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by 16.8% (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 16%). Revenue from our accommodation reservation services contributed approximately 85% of the year-over-year increase for the year ended December 31, 2018. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 under the current revenue standard, where revenue is recognized when the travel begins (at ""check-in""), were substantially similar to total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, if reported under the previous revenue recognition accounting standard, where revenue was recognized when travel was completed (at ""check-out"") (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Total revenues as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings of 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is due in part to the timing of booking versus travel resulting from the impact of decelerating gross bookings growth in the year ended December 31, 2018.Our international businesses accounted for approximately $13.0 billion of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $11.1 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017. Total revenues attributable to our international businesses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 17.4%, compared to gross profit attributable to our international businesses for the year ended December 31, 2017 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 17%). Total revenues attributable to our U.S. businesses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 4611.6%, compared to gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to growth in each of our U.S. businesses. In addition, the adjustment to reverse a portion of OpenTable's loyalty program liability had a favorable impact on total revenues attributable to our U.S. businesses for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $27 million. Operating Expenses Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangePerformance marketing$4,447 $4,161 6.9%% of Total revenues in 2018 / % of Gross profit in 201730.6% 33.5% Brand marketing$509 $435 17.2%% of Total revenues in 2018 / % of Gross profit in 20173.5% 3.5% We rely on performance marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. Performance marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; and (4) other performance-based marketing and incentives. For the year ended December 31, 2018, performance marketing expenses increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, to generate increased gross bookings and revenue. We adjust our performance marketing spend based on our growth and profitability objectives and the expected performance of our performance marketing channels. Performance marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased, compared to performance marketing expense as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to increased performance marketing ROIs and changes in the share of traffic by channel. We recognize the substantial majority of our performance marketing expenses as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which the associated reservations are booked. In contrast, we generally do not recognize revenue from these reservations until the travel begins or, for periods beginning prior to January 1, 2018, until the travel is completed, which can be in a quarter other than when the reservations are booked. In addition, we may from time to time, as we did beginning the third quarter of 2017 and continuing through 2018, pursue a strategy of improving our performance marketing ROIs, which could negatively impact growth and positively impact performance marketing efficiency and profitability. Brand marketing expenses consist primarily of television advertising, online video advertising (including the airing of our television advertising online) and online display advertising, as well as other marketing spend such as public relations, trade shows and sponsorships. For the year ended December 31, 2018, brand marketing expenses increased by 17.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased brand marketing expenses at Booking.com in order to increase brand awareness and grow the number of customers that come directly to the Booking.com platforms.Sales and Other Expenses Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangeSales and other expenses$830 $517 60.4%% of Total revenues in 2018 / % of Gross profit in 20175.7% 4.2% Sales and other expenses consist primarily of: (1) credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for customer chargebacks associated with merchant transactions; (4) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables; and (5) customer relations costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales and other expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to increased transaction volumes (primarily, increased merchant transaction volumes at Booking.com), higher customer chargebacks and higher bad debt expense related to accommodation commission receivables. 47Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangePersonnel$2,042 $1,660 23.1%% of Total revenues in 2018 / % of Gross profit in 201714.1% 13.3% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes, and employee health and other benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in aggregate salaries of $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to increased average salary per employee as well as headcount growth to support our businesses. Stock-based compensation expense was $317 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Headcount increased, primarily at Booking.com, in the areas of information technology to support various business initiatives, such as alternative accommodations, marketing, payments and in-destination experiences, and customer service to support transaction growth.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangeGeneral and administrative$699 $576 21.3%% of Total revenues in 2018 / % of Gross profit in 20174.8% 4.6% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) personnel-related expenses such as travel, relocation, recruiting and training expenses; and (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to an accrual for travel transaction taxes of $50 million for certain subsidiaries related to prior periods recognized in 2018 (see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), higher occupancy and office expenses associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our international businesses, as well as the fair value adjustment recognized in 2018 of $19 million to the contingent liability related to an acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a $27 million litigation-related expense in 2017 that did not occur in 2018 and a reversal of previously accrued travel transaction taxes of $6 million recorded in 2018 based on a favorable ruling in the State of California. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangeInformation technology$233 $189 23.2%% of Total revenues in 2018 / % of Gross profit in 20171.6% 1.5% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; (3) outsourced data center costs; and (4) payments to outside consultants. Information technology expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to increased software fees and data center and cloud costs. 48Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangeDepreciation and amortization$426 $363 17.5%% of Total revenues in 2018 / % of Gross profit in 20172.9% 2.9% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation of computer equipment; (3) depreciation of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increases of $36 million in data center equipment depreciation expenses and $19 million of internally developed software depreciation expenses due to higher capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs to support growth and geographic expansion.Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangeInterest income$187 $157 18.9%Interest expense(269) (254) 6.1%Net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities(367) — N/AImpairment of investments— (8) N/AForeign currency transactions and other(57) (34) 58.9%Total$(506) $(139) 262.3% For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest income increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the growing impact of our cash pooling structure initiated in 2017, which enables the Company to aggregate and invest daily operating cash in money market funds. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the increase in interest income, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was also due to higher yields in cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by lower average invested balance in marketable securities. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily attributable to our borrowings under our cash pooling structure and our Senior Notes issued in August 2017, partially offset by the maturity of our 1.0% Convertible Senior Notes in March 2018 (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2018 are almost entirely related to our equity investments in Ctrip.com International Ltd. (""Ctrip""). Pursuant to the adoption of the accounting update on financial instruments in the first quarter of 2018, changes in fair value of marketable equity securities are recognized in net income for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, rather than accumulated other comprehensive income (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). Foreign currency transactions and other includes foreign currency gains or losses on derivative contracts, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, including costs related to foreign currency transactions, and net realized gains or losses on investments and other income or expense. Foreign currency transaction losses, including costs related to foreign currency transactions, resulted in foreign currency losses of $53 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 49Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 ChangeIncome tax expense$837 $2,058 (59.3)%% of Earnings before income taxes17.3% 46.8% Our 2018 effective tax rates differ from the 2018 U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax and the $46 million benefit resulting from the adjustment to our prior year provisional income tax expense due to our completion of the accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act, partially offset by the effect of higher international tax rates and U.S. federal and state tax associated with our current year international earnings, resulting from the introduction of the Tax Act, as well as certain nondeductible expenses. Our 2017 effective tax rate differs from the 2017 U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to a one-time transition tax of $1.6 billion on mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated unremitted international earnings pursuant to the Tax Act, which includes U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by (1) a net tax benefit of $217 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and (2) lower international tax rates. Our effective tax rate is lower for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a one-time provisional income tax expense of $1.4 billion recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 pursuant to the Tax Act, partially offset by the effect of higher international tax rates and U.S. federal and state tax associated with our current year international earnings during the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting from the introduction of the Tax Act. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment under Dutch tax law, which had a significant beneficial impact on the Company's effective tax rate for those periods. While we expect Booking.com to continue to qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatment with respect to a portion of its earnings for the foreseeable future, the loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit, whether due to a change in tax law or a determination by the Dutch government that Booking.com's activities are not innovative or for any other reason, would substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations. During December 2017, legislation was enacted in the Netherlands that increased the Innovation Box Tax rate from 5% to 7%, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - "" We may not be able to maintain our 'Innovation Box Tax' benefit."" 50Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 Operating and Statistical Metrics Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeAgency$69,697 $58,638 18.9%Merchant11,529 9,449 22.0%Total$81,225 $68,087 19.3% Gross bookings increased by 19.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 19%), almost entirely due to growth of 20.9% in accommodation room night reservations. Accommodation ADRs on a constant-currency basis were relatively unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, foreign exchange rate fluctuations slightly benefited gross bookings growth in U.S. Dollars. We believe that unit growth rates and total gross bookings on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not receive payments from travelers for the travel services provided. Agency gross bookings increased by 18.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, almost entirely due to the growth in gross bookings from Booking.com agency retail accommodation room night reservations.Merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we receive payments from travelers for the travel services provided. Merchant gross bookings increased by 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately 91% of the increase was due to growth in gross bookings from our merchant accommodation reservation services for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Growth in our merchant gross bookings from rental car reservation services and airline ticket reservation services also contributed to this growth.Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeRoom nights673 557 20.9 %Rental car days73 67 9.6 %Airline tickets7 7 (5.3)% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 20.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to strong execution by our brand teams to add new properties to our accommodation reservation services, advertise our brands to consumers and provide a continuously improving experience for customers on our desktop and mobile platforms, as well as the ongoing shift from offline to online for travel bookings. Rental car day reservations increased by 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to strong execution by our brand teams to advertise our brands to consumers and provide a continuously improving experience for customers on our desktop and mobile platforms, as well as the ongoing shift from offline to online for travel bookings. 51Airline ticket reservations decreased by 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a decline in priceline's retail airline ticket reservations and the discontinuation on September 1, 2016 of priceline’s Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservation offering, partially offset by an increase in priceline's Express Deals® airline ticket reservation offering.

Merchant revenues increased by 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in our merchant price-disclosed accommodation and rental car reservation services, mostly offset by a significant decrease in revenues from priceline's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. On September 1, 2016, priceline’s Name Your Own Price® airline ticket reservation offering was discontinued. Our priceline's Name Your Own Price® reservation services, which declined year-over-year, are recorded ""gross"" in revenue with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues. Our other merchant revenues, which in total grew year-over-year, are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs. As a result, changes in Name Your Own Price® reservation revenue disproportionately affect merchant revenues as compared to our other merchant revenues. Advertising and other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of advertising revenues, restaurant reservation revenues and subscription revenues for restaurant reservation management services. Advertising and other revenues increased by 17.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of the Momondo Group revenue amounting to $72 million since its acquisition on July 24, 2017, other growth in our KAYAK business and increased diner reservation volumes at OpenTable. Cost of Revenues Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeCost of revenues$242 $415 (41.6)% For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost paid to travel service providers for priceline's Name Your Own Price® and vacation package reservation services, net of applicable taxes and charges; and (2) fees paid to third parties by priceline to return travel itinerary information for consumer search queries. Cost of revenues decreased by 41.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in priceline's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Agency revenues have no cost of revenues. 52Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeGross profit$12,439 $10,328 20.4%Gross margin98.1% 96.1% Total gross profit increased by 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 19%). Gross profit from our accommodation reservation services contributed approximately 90% of the increase. In addition, the inclusion of the Momondo Group since its acquisition on July 24, 2017 contributed $72 million of gross profit. Total gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, because our revenues are disproportionately affected by priceline's Name Your Own Price® reservation services. Name Your Own Price® reservation services are recorded ""gross"" in revenue with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues, and in the year ended December 31, 2017 these revenues represented a smaller percentage of total revenues than in the year ended December 31, 2016. Our price-disclosed reservation services, which are recorded in revenue ""net"" of travel service provider costs, have been growing and priceline's Name Your Own Price® reservation services have been declining. Gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is due in part to the timing of booking versus travel resulting from the impact of decelerating gross bookings growth in the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as the inclusion of the Momondo Group since its acquisition on July 24, 2017. Our international businesses accounted for approximately $11.1 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit attributable to our international businesses increased by 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 21%). Gross profit attributable to our U.S. businesses increased by 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to growth in gross profit for all of our U.S. businesses.Operating Expenses Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangePerformance marketing$4,161 $3,479 19.6%% of Gross profit33.5% 33.7% Brand marketing$435 $327 32.9%% of Gross profit3.5% 3.2% We rely on performance marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. Performance marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; and (4) other performance-based marketing and incentives. For the year ended December 31, 2017, performance marketing expenses increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, to generate increased gross bookings and gross profit. We adjust our performance marketing spend based on our growth and profitability objectives and the expected performance of our performance marketing channels. Performance marketing expense as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the timing of performance marketing spend relative to when associated revenue is recognized, as well as changes in the share of traffic by channel. In addition, during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, we pursued a strategy of improving our performance marketing ROIs, which positively impacted performance marketing efficiency. We recognize the substantial majority of our performance marketing expenses as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which the associated reservations are booked. In contrast, we generally do not recognize revenue from these reservations until the travel occurs, which can be in a quarter other than when the reservations are booked. 53Brand marketing expenses consist mainly of television advertising, online video advertising (including the airing of our television advertising online) and online display advertising, as well as other marketing spend such as public relations, trade shows and sponsorships. For the year ended December 31, 2017, brand marketing expenses increased by 32.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased brand marketing by Booking.com, KAYAK, which includes expenses related to the Momondo Group since its acquisition on July 24, 2017, and priceline. We increased our brand marketing expense in order to increase awareness of our brands and grow the number of customers that come directly to our websites.Sales and Other Expenses Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeSales and other expenses$517 $422 22.4%% of Gross profit4.2% 4.1% Sales and other expenses consist primarily of: (1) credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) customer relations costs; (4) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables; and (5) provisions for customer chargebacks associated with merchant transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales and other expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to increased transaction volumes and higher bad debt expense related to accommodation commission receivables.Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangePersonnel$1,660 $1,350 22.9%% of Gross profit13.3% 13.1% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, and employee health and other benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in aggregate salaries of $219 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to headcount growth to support our business. Stock-based compensation expense was $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $250 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeGeneral and administrative$576 $452 27.7%% of Gross profit4.6% 4.4% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) personnel-related expenses such as travel, relocation, recruiting and training expenses; and (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to higher personnel-related, occupancy and office expenses associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our international businesses, as well as a $27 million litigation-related expense, of which $19 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, and higher fees for outside professionals, including professional fees related to our acquisition of the Momondo Group. 54Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeInformation technology$189 $142 33.0%% of Gross profit1.5% 1.4% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services; (3) outsourced data center costs; and (4) payments to outside consultants. Information technology expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to growth in our worldwide operations. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeDepreciation and amortization$363 $309 17.4%% of Gross profit2.9% 3.0% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation of computer equipment; (3) depreciation of internally developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of increased depreciation expenses due to capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion, the inclusion of intangible amortization for the Momondo Group since its acquisition on July 24, 2017, and increased capitalized software development costs.Impairment of Goodwill Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeImpairment of goodwill$— $941 N/A% of Gross profitN/A 9.1% During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill related to OpenTable, which is not tax deductible, of $941 million (see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeInterest income$157 $95 65.6 %Interest expense(254) (208) 22.2 %Impairment of investments(8) (63) (88.0)%Foreign currency transactions and other(34) (17) 108.7 %Total$(139) $(193) (27.7)% For the year ended December 31, 2017, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance and higher yields. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to 55interest expense attributable to our Senior Notes issued in May 2016, March 2017 and August 2017 (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on impairments of our equity investments without readily determinable fair value.Foreign currency transactions and other includes foreign currency gains or losses on derivative contracts, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, including costs related to foreign currency transactions, and net realized gains or losses on investments. Foreign currency transaction losses, including costs related to foreign currency transactions, resulted in foreign currency losses of $31 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 ChangeIncome tax expense$2,058 $578 255.8%% of Earnings before income taxes46.8% 21.3% Our 2017 effective tax rate differs from the 2017 U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to a one-time transition tax of approximately $1.6 billion on mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated unremitted international earnings pursuant to the Tax Act, which includes U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by (1) a net tax benefit of $217 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and (2) lower international tax rates. Our 2016 effective tax rate differs from the 2016 U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to lower international tax rates, partially offset by the non-deductible impairment charge for goodwill of $941 million related to OpenTable recognized in 2016 (see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) and the non-deductible impairment charge of $60 million associated with a cost-method investment recognized in 2016 (see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is higher than our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to the net tax expense resulting from the Tax Act, partially offset by an increased proportion of our income being taxed at lower international tax rates due to the growth of our international businesses and the non-deductible impairment charges recognized in 2016 referred to above that caused an increase in the 2016 effective tax rate. 56Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2018, we had $14.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities, of which approximately $6.4 billion is held by our international subsidiaries and is denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, Euros and, to a lesser extent, British Pounds Sterling and other currencies. Cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities are comprised of U.S. and international corporate bonds, U.S. and international government securities, high-grade commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, convertible debt securities and American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") of Ctrip, Meituan Dianping equity securities, money market funds and time deposits (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).In the first quarter of 2019, 2018 and 2017, we prepaid a portion of our Dutch income tax liability of $650 million, $726 million and $500 million, respectively, to earn prepayment discounts. In the first quarter of 2019, we paid assessments of 356 million Euros to French tax authorities in order to preserve our right to contest the assessments in court (see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional transition tax liability as of December 31, 2017 of $1.3 billion. At December 31, 2018, the liability of $1.3 billion includes $1.2 billion in ""Long-term U.S. transition tax liability"" and $111 million in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with the Tax Act, generally, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by the Company. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In April 2018, we paid $139 million, net of cash acquired, and issued shares of our common stock in an amount of $110 million in connection with the acquisition of FareHarbor, a leading provider of business-to-business activities distribution services. In November 2018, we paid $134 million, net of cash acquired, to complete the acquisition of HotelsCombined, a hotel meta-search company. In July 2018, we invested $500 million in preferred shares of Didi Chuxing, the leading mobile transportation and ride-hailing platform in China. In October 2018, we invested $200 million in preferred shares of Grab, a leading on-demand transportation and mobile service platform in Southeast Asia.In June 2015, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $70 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $50 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding and $5 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. We borrowed $100 million under this revolving credit facility in January 2019. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the revolving credit facility. In March 2018, in connection with the maturity of the remaining outstanding 2018 Notes, we paid $714 million to satisfy the aggregate principal amount due and paid an additional $773 million in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. In the first quarter of 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $8.0 billion of our common stock, in addition to amounts previously authorized. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 3,100,307 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $6.0 billion. At December 31, 2018, we had a remaining aggregate amount of $4.5 billion authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock. In 2019, we have continued to make repurchases of our common stock and we may continue to make additional repurchases of our common stock from time to time, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. In September 2016, we signed a turnkey agreement to construct an office building for Booking.com’s headquarters in the Netherlands for 270 million Euros. Upon signing this agreement, we paid 48 million Euros to the developer, which included 43 million Euros for the acquired land-use rights and 5 million Euros for the building construction. The remaining 222 million Euro obligation related to the turnkey agreement principally relates to the building construction cost. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid 66 million Euros ($80 million) related to our obligation under the turnkey agreement and have a 156 million Euro obligation remaining at December 31, 2018, which will be paid between 2019 and 2021 when we anticipate construction will be complete. In addition to the turnkey agreement, we have a remaining obligation at December 31, 2018 to pay 75 million Euros over the remaining term of the acquired land lease, which expires in 2065. We will also make additional capital expenditures to fit out and furnish the office space. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 57Cash Flow AnalysisNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $5.3 billion, resulting from net income of $4.0 billion, a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.2 billion and net favorable changes in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $125 million. Non-cash items were principally associated with net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization and the provision for uncollectible accounts. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting the increase in business volume and growth in Booking.com's merchant transactions, were primarily related to a $635 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $319 million increase in accounts receivable and $201 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $4.7 billion, resulting from net income of $2.3 billion, a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $743 million and net favorable changes in working capital of $293 million and long-term assets and liabilities of $1.3 billion, which is principally related to the long-term transition tax liability recognized as a result of the U.S. Tax Act (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Non-cash items were principally associated with stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of debt discount. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the increase in business volume, were primarily related to a $687 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $270 million increase in accounts receivable and $124 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $4.0 billion, resulting from net income of $2.1 billion, a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.6 billion and net favorable changes in working capital and other long-term assets and liabilities of $214 million. Non-cash items were principally associated with impairment of goodwill, stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting the increase in business volume, were primarily related to a $514 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $284 million increase in accounts receivable. Net cash provided by investing activities was $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, principally resulting from net sales of investments of $2.9 billion, partially offset by acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, of $273 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, principally resulting from net purchases of investments of $3.4 billion and acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, of $553 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, principally resulting from net purchases of investments of $3.1 billion and $48 million paid for the acquisition of land-use rights related to the construction of Booking.com's new headquarters in the Netherlands. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment was $442 million, $288 million and $220 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were related to additional data center capacity and new offices to support growth and geographic expansion, principally related to our Booking.com and agoda brands. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the payment of $78 million related to the turnkey agreement for constructing Booking.com's future headquarters. Net cash used in financing activities was $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, which primarily consisted of payments for repurchase of common stock of $6.0 billion and payments for the conversion of Senior Notes of $1.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from short-term borrowing of $25 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $79 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily consisted of payments for repurchase of common stock of $1.8 billion, payments for the conversion of Senior Notes of $286 million and repayment of the debt of $15 million assumed in the acquisition of the Momondo Group, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $2.0 billion. Net cash used in financing activities was $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which primarily consisted of payments for repurchase of common stock of $1.0 billion, offset by proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $995 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $16 million.ContingenciesFrench tax authorities conducted an audit of the years 2003 through 2012. They are asserting that Booking.com has a permanent establishment in France and are seeking to recover what they claim are unpaid income taxes and value-added taxes. In December 2015, the French tax authorities issued Booking.com assessments related to those tax years for approximately 356 million Euros, the majority of which would represent penalties and interest. We believe that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with French tax law and we are contesting the assessments. In December 2018, the French tax 58authorities issued a formal demand for payment of the amounts assessed. As a result, in January 2019, we paid the amount assessed in order to preserve our right to contest the assessments in court. Such payment does not constitute an admission that we owe the taxes and will be refunded (with interest) to us to the extent we prevail. If we are unable to resolve the matter with the French tax authorities, we plan to challenge the assessments in the French courts. The French tax authorities have begun a similar audit of the tax years 2013 through 2015, which could result in additional assessments. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""Contractual ObligationsThe following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2018: Payments due by Period (in millions)Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations(1) $643 $163 $248 $114 $118Land lease obligation(1) 81 1 4 4 72Building construction obligation(1) 178 68 110 — —Senior Notes(2) 9,897 174 2,342 2,788 4,593Revolving credit facility(3) 4 3 1 — —Contingent consideration(4) 28 28 — — —U.S. transition tax liability 1,277 111 206 223 737Total(5) $12,108 $548 $2,911 $3,129 $5,520(1)See the section on ""Operating Leases"" and ""Building Construction"" section of Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2)Represents the aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes outstanding at December 31, 2018 and cumulative interest to maturity of $1.1 billion. Convertible debt does not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or shares of common stock at our option. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.(3)Represents fees on both uncommitted funds and outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2018.(4)See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.(5)We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $162 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018, which principally consists of $68 million in deferred rents and $39 million unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). We have excluded these long-term liabilities from the contractual obligations table above. Deferred rents represent the difference in rent expense recognized in the income statements and rent payments related to operating leases. A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for the liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In 2018, we signed an agreement for a lease related to approximately 222,000 square feet of office space in the city of Manchester in the United Kingdom for the headquarters of Rentalcars.com. Rentalcars.com's obligation to execute the lease is conditional upon the developer completing certain activities, which are expected to be completed in 2020. If these activities are completed, the lease will commence for a term of approximately 13 years and we will have a lease obligation of approximately 65 million British Pounds Sterling, excluding lease incentives. Rentalcars.com will also make capital expenditures to fit out and furnish the office space. The obligation is not included in the table of contraction obligations presented above. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth 59or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company has exposure to several types of market risk: changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices.We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use currency exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2018. Fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our available-for-sale investments in marketable debt securities assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of approximately $126 million and $206 million at December 31, 2018 and and 2017, respectively. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity. This amount excludes our investment in Ctrip.com International Ltd. (""Ctrip"") senior convertible notes, which are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of Ctrip's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") than changes in interest rates. The fair value of our Ctrip senior convertible notes will most likely increase as the market price of Ctrip's ADSs increases and will likely decrease as the market price of Ctrip's ADSs falls. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was approximately $8.8 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively. We estimate that the fair value of such debt was approximately $9.3 billion and $11.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A substantial portion of the fair value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount relates to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible notes. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euro). As a result, we face exposures to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the operating results of our international operations are translated from local currencies into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currencies. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.As a result of currency exchange rate changes, our foreign-currency-denominated gross bookings, revenues and operating expenses as expressed in U.S. Dollars are higher for the year ended December 31, 2018 than they would have been had foreign exchange rates remained where they were for the year ended December 31, 2017. Since our expenses are generally 60denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. The aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated long-term debt, and accrued interest thereon, provide a hedge against the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of certain of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries.From time to time, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. Our derivative contracts principally address foreign currency translation risks for the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and certain other currencies versus the U.S. Dollar. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no such outstanding derivative contracts.We are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in fair value of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies. For periods beginning from January 1, 2018, changes in the fair value of our investments in publicly-traded equity securities are recognized in net income. Our investments in private companies, excluding our investment in Grab (see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), are measured at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, with changes in value also recognized in net income (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). The fair value of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies, excluding our investment in Grab, was $1.0 billion and $501 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018, and $1.0 billion and $451 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of these investments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 will result in a loss of approximately $150 million and $140 million, respectively, being recognized in net income.",2023-12-30 18:44:29.029127
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2020,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include those discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.OverviewOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We seek to empower people to cut through travel barriers, such as money, time, language and overwhelming options, so they can use our services to easily and confidently get where they want to go, stay where they want to stay, dine where they want to dine, pay how they want to pay and experience what they want to experience. We connect consumers wishing to make travel reservations with providers of travel services around the world through our online platforms. Through one or more of our brands, consumers can: book a broad array of accommodations (including hotels, motels, resorts, homes, apartments, bed and breakfasts, hostels and other properties); make a car rental reservation or arrange for an airport taxi; make a dinner reservation; or book a cruise, flight, vacation package, tour or activity. Consumers can also use our meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information, such as airline ticket, hotel reservation and rental car reservation information, from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. In addition, we offer various other services to consumers and partners, such as certain travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services to restaurants.We offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, KAYAK, priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable. While historically our brands operated on a largely independent basis and many of them focused on a particular service (e.g., accommodation reservations) or geography, we are increasing the collaboration, cooperation and interdependency among our brands in our efforts to provide consumers with the best and most comprehensive services. We also seek to maximize the benefits of our scale by sharing resources and technological innovations, co-developing new services and coordinating activities in key markets among our brands. For example, Booking.com, the world’s leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations (based on room nights booked), offers rental car and other ground transportation services, flights, restaurant reservations, tours and activities reservations and other services, many of which are supported by our other brands. Similarly, hotel reservations available through Booking.com are also generally available through agoda and priceline. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Segment Reporting for information on our operating segments.Our results include FareHarbor and HotelsCombined since they were acquired in April 2018 and November 2018, respectively. We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands collectively as ""Booking Holdings,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us."" Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda and Rentalcars.com and the international businesses of KAYAK and OpenTable. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the United States is part of our international results. In 2019, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 90% of our consolidated revenues. A significant majority of our revenues, including a significant majority of our international revenues, is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.We derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees, advertising services, restaurant reservations and restaurant management services, and various other services, such as travel-related insurance revenues. 36TrendsThe recent coronavirus outbreak has had a significant and negative impact on our business during the first quarter of 2020, in particular in China and certain other Asian markets, though concerns about the coronavirus are also negatively impacting travel demand (and therefore our business) generally. In the more affected markets like China, we have seen a significant increase in cancellations and reduction in new bookings, and ADRs have also been negatively affected. The ultimate impact of the outbreak on our business is impossible to predict with certainty, and therefore the full extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business and results of operations is unknown. However, decreased travel demand resulting from the outbreak has had a negative impact, and is likely to have a negative and material impact, on our business, growth and results of operations. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""Over the last several years, we have experienced significant growth in our accommodation reservation services. We believe this growth is the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the widespread adoption of mobile devices and the growth of travel overall. We also believe this growth is the result of the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to increase the number and the variety of accommodations we offer consumers, increase and improve content, build distribution and improve the consumer experience on our online platforms, as well as consistently and effectively marketing our brands through performance and brand marketing efforts. These year-over-year growth rates have generally decelerated. Given the size of our accommodation reservation business and the general slowing growth rate of the online travel market discussed below, we expect that our year-over-year growth rates will generally continue to decelerate, though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate and there may be periods of acceleration from time to time. We are a global business, and online travel growth rates vary across the world depending on numerous factors, including local and regional economic conditions, individual disposable income, access to the internet and adoption of e-commerce. Online travel growth rates have generally slowed in markets such as North America and Europe where online activity is high and consumers have been engaging in e-commerce transactions for many years, while online travel growth rates remain relatively high in markets such as Asia-Pacific where incomes are rising more quickly and the increased availability and use of mobile devices has accelerated the growth of internet usage and travel e-commerce transactions. Over the long-term, we expect online travel growth rates to slow as markets continue to mature. However, we believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the markets in which we operate, including in both mature and fast-growing markets. Further, we believe that this opportunity for growth exists because we feel we provide significant value to travel service providers, regardless of size or geography, due to our global reach and online marketing expertise. For example, we believe that accommodation providers of all sizes, from large hotel chains to small, independent hotels and alternative accommodations such as homes and apartments, benefit from using our services, which enable them to reach a broader audience of potential customers.Our growth has primarily been generated by the worldwide accommodation reservation business of Booking.com, which is our most significant brand, and has been due, in part, to the availability of a large number of properties through Booking.com. Booking.com included approximately 2,580,000 properties on its website at December 31, 2019, consisting of approximately 460,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 2,120,000 homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, compared to approximately 2,180,000 properties (including approximately 436,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 1,744,000 homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay) at December 31, 2018. Booking.com categorizes properties listed on its website as either (a) hotels, motels and resorts, which groups together more traditional accommodation types (including hostels and inns), or (b) homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, also referred to as alternative accommodations, which encompasses all other types of accommodations, including bed and breakfasts, villas, apart-hotels and beyond. We intend to continue to improve the accommodation choices available for reservation on our platforms, however the growth rate of our accommodations may vary in part as a result of removing accommodations from our platforms from time to time. Many of the newer accommodations we add to our travel reservation services, especially in highly-penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms or higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of consumers (e.g., hostels and bed and breakfasts). Because alternative accommodations are often either a single unit or a small collection of independent units, these properties generally represent more limited booking opportunities than hotels, motels and resorts, which generally have more units to rent per property. Further, alternative accommodations in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism seasons or other factors or may not be available at peak times due to use by the property owners. We may also experience lower profit margins with respect to these properties due to certain additional costs, such as increased customer service costs, related to offering these accommodations on our platforms. As our alternative accommodation business has grown, these different characteristics have negatively impacted our profit margins and we expect this trend to continue. 37Further, to the extent these properties represent an increasing percentage of the properties added to our platforms, we expect that our room nights growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time (since each such property has fewer booking opportunities). As a result of the foregoing, as the percentage of alternative accommodation properties increases, the number of reservations per property will likely continue to decrease. We believe that continuing to expand the number and variety of accommodations available through our services, in particular Booking.com, will help us to continue to grow our accommodation reservation business.We are constantly innovating to grow our business by, among other things, providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms (i.e., websites and mobile apps) to ensure that we are meeting the needs of online consumers while aiming to exceed their expectations. As part of these ongoing efforts, we have a long-term strategy to build a more integrated offering of multiple elements of travel, which we refer to as the ""Connected Trip."" Although we expect our efforts to build the Connected Trip may increase revenue growth over time, we may see a negative impact on our operating margins in the near term as we incur the expenses associated with these investments. Further, to the extent our non-accommodation services grow faster than our accommodation services, whether as part of the Connected Trip or otherwise, our operating margins may be negatively affected if we experience an increasing mix of revenues from lower-margin services. As part of our strategy to provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com and enable the growth of our in-destination activities businesses, Booking.com is increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis, where it facilitates payments from travelers for the services provided. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer secure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that adding these types of service offerings will benefit consumers and travel service providers, as well as our gross bookings, room night and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional expenses for personnel, payment processing, customer chargebacks (including those related to fraud) and other expenses related to these transactions, which are recorded in ""Personnel"" and ""Sales and other expenses"" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as associated incremental revenues in the form of credit card rebates, for example, which are recorded in ""Merchant revenues."" As this business continues to grow, we expect these expenses to continue to increase, which would negatively impact our operating margins despite increases in associated incremental revenues. Components of revenues and expenses related to our merchant business may be recognized in different periods. These timing factors could impact our operating margins as well as the relationship between our gross bookings and revenues in a particular period, especially as our merchant business increases as a percentage of our overall business.We compete globally with both online and traditional providers of travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data and financial and other resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market and has grown rapidly in this area, including by offering a flight meta-search product (Google Flights), a hotel meta-search product (Google Hotel Ads), a vacation rental meta-search product, its ""Book on Google"" reservation functionality and integrating its hotel and restaurant meta-search products into its Google Maps app, as well as Google Travel, a planning tool which aggregates its flight, hotel and packages products in one website. Our markets are also subject to rapidly changing conditions, including technological developments, consumer behavior changes, regulatory changes and travel service provider consolidation. We expect these trends to continue. For example, we have experienced a significant shift of both direct and indirect business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Advertising and distribution opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes. In addition, the revenue earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay, have lower accommodation average daily rates (""ADRs"") and are not made as far in advance. For more detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face, see Part I, Item 1, Business - ""Competition,"" Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance."" and ""Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates challenges and may enable device companies such as Google and Apple to compete directly with us."" and ""We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes."" Although we believe that providing an extensive collection of properties, excellent customer service and an intuitive, easy-to-use consumer experience are important factors influencing a consumer's decision to make a reservation, for many consumers, particularly in certain markets, the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether a consumer will book a reservation. As a result, it is increasingly important to offer travel services, such as accommodation reservations, at competitive prices, whether through discounts, coupons, closed-user group rates or loyalty programs, or otherwise. These 38initiatives have resulted and in the future may result in lower ADRs and lower revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. Discounting and couponing coupled with a high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in Asian markets. In some cases, our competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction, or offer travel services at a loss, in order to gain market share.We have observed a trend of declining constant-currency accommodation ADRs, which we expect to continue, though the rate of decline may fluctuate and there may be periods of stable or increasing ADRs. We believe the trend of declining ADRs is partially driven by the negative impact of the changing geographical mix of our business (e.g., lower ADR regions like Asia-Pacific are generally growing faster than higher ADR regions like Western Europe) as well as pricing pressures within local markets from time to time resulting from competitive conditions, weakening economic conditions or changes in travel patterns. These declining ADR trends have resulted in and may continue to result in our gross bookings growing at a lower rate of growth than our accommodation room nights.We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Historically our performance marketing expenses have increased significantly, however, more recently, we have experienced more moderate growth rates, a trend we expect to continue. Our performance marketing expense is primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our websites. More recently, growth of some of these channels has slowed. Performance marketing expenses were $4.4 billion, $4.4 billion and $4.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We also invested $548 million, $509 million and $435 million in brand marketing for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing television advertising, online video advertising (for example, on YouTube and Facebook), online display advertising and other brand marketing. We intend to continue a strategy of promoting brand awareness through both online and offline marketing efforts, including by expanding brand campaigns into additional markets, which we expect will increase our brand marketing expenses over time. We have observed increased brand marketing by other OTCs, meta-search services and travel service providers, which may make our brand marketing efforts more expensive and less effective.Performance marketing efficiency, expressed as performance marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues, is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are, in some cases, outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers and the extent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings. For example, competition for desired rankings in search results and/or a decline in ad clicks by consumers could increase our costs per click and reduce our performance marketing efficiency. Changes by Google or any of our other search or meta-search partners in how it presents travel search results, including, if applicable, by placing its own offerings at or near the top of search results, or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites. We have observed a long-term trend of decreasing performance marketing returns on investment (""ROIs""). More recently, we have observed periods of stable or increasing ROIs, however, it is uncertain whether this trend will continue or if ROIs will return to the prior trend of declining over time. We may from time to time, as we did beginning in the third quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2018, pursue a strategy of improving our performance marketing ROIs, which could negatively impact growth and positively impact performance marketing efficiency and profitability. When evaluating our performance marketing spend, we consider several factors for each channel, such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incrementality of the traffic we receive and the anticipated repeat rate from a particular platform, as well as other factors. The amount of business we obtain through each performance marketing channel is impacted by numerous factors, including bidding decisions by us and our competitors (including decisions to optimize performance marketing ROIs) and the marketing efforts and success of those channels to attract consumers and generate demand. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We rely on performance and brand marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our platforms and grow our business."" and ""Our business could be negatively affected by changes in online search and meta-search algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.""In recent years, we experienced significant increases in our cancellation rates, which negatively affected our marketing efficiency and results of operations. Beginning in the third quarter of 2018, our cancellation rates have generally decreased, which has benefited our marketing efficiency and results of operations. We believe that many factors influence cancellation rates, and it is uncertain whether future cancellation rates will continue to decrease, stabilize or return to their prior trend of generally increasing over time.Perceived or actual adverse economic conditions, including slow, slowing or negative economic growth, high or rising unemployment rates, inflation and weakening currencies, and concerns over government responses such as higher taxes or 39tariffs and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. Further, political uncertainty, conditions or events, such as the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (""Brexit""), including uncertainty in the implementation of Brexit and other political concerns can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. At times, we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates, increased cancellation rates and weaker trends in ADRs across many regions of the world, particularly in those countries that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainties, which we believe are due at least in part to these macro-economic conditions and concerns. For more detail, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""These and other macro-economic uncertainties, such as geopolitical tensions and differing central bank monetary policies, have led to significant volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and other currencies. Significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, stock markets and oil prices can also impact consumer travel behavior. As noted earlier, our international business represents a substantial majority of our financial results. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our international businesses are translated from local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. As a result, both the absolute amounts of and percentage changes in our foreign-currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our foreign-currency-denominated gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars are lower for the year ended December 31, 2019 than they would have been had foreign currency exchange rates remained where they were for the year ended December 31, 2018. For example, total revenues from our international operations grew 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, but, without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, grew year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 8%. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. Historically, the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated long-term debt, and accrued interest thereon, provided a hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of one of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we have only designated certain portions of the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated debt as a hedge, and as a result we have recognized foreign currency transaction gains or losses. The foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.""We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated operating results into U.S. Dollars. However, such derivative instruments are short-term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuations that could impact growth rates for our gross bookings or revenues (see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts).Many taxing authorities are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues and have targeted large multinational technology companies in these efforts. As a result, many countries have implemented or are considering adoption of a digital services tax that imposes a tax on revenue earned from digital advertisements and the use of online platforms, even when there is no physical presence in the jurisdiction. Currently rates for this tax range from 2% to 7.5% of revenue deemed generated in the jurisdiction. The digital services taxes currently in effect have negatively impacted our results of operations and if many other countries pass similar legislation, the collective impact of all of these measures could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. For more information, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""Many national governments have conducted or are conducting investigations into competitive practices within the online travel industry, and we may be involved or affected by such investigations and their results. Some countries have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practices within the online travel industry. For example, France, Italy, Belgium and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety. Also, a number of governments are investigating or conducting information-gathering exercises with respect to compliance by OTCs with consumer protection laws, including practices related to the display of search results and search ranking algorithms, claims regarding discounts, disclosure of charges and availability, and similar messaging. For more information on these investigations and their potential effects on our business, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Our business is subject to various competition, anti-trust, consumer protection and online commerce laws, 40rules and regulations around the world, and as the size of our business grows, scrutiny of our business by legislators and regulators in these areas may intensify."" In addition to the price parity and consumer protection investigations, from time to time national competition authorities, other governmental agencies, trade associations and private parties take legal actions, including commencing legal proceedings, that may affect our operations. In general, increased regulatory focus on online businesses, including online travel businesses like ours, could result in increased compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. SeasonalityThe majority of our gross bookings are generated in the first half of the year, as consumers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. However, we generally recognize revenue from these bookings when the travel begins (at ""check-in""), which can be in a quarter other than when the associated reservations are booked. In contrast, we expense the substantial majority of our marketing activities as the expense is incurred, which, in the case of performance marketing in particular, is typically in the quarter in which associated reservations are booked. As a result of this potential timing difference between when we record marketing expense and when we recognize associated revenue, we experience our highest levels of profitability in the third quarter of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of accommodation check-ins for the year for our European and North American businesses. The first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience additional volatility in earnings growth rates due to these seasonal timing factors. For our Asia-Pacific business, we experience the highest level of accommodation check-ins in the fourth quarter. As the relative growth rates for our businesses fluctuate, the quarterly distribution of our operating results may vary.For several years, we experienced an expansion of the booking window (the average time between the making of a travel reservation and the travel), which impacts the relationship between our gross bookings (recognized at the time of booking) and our revenues (recognized at the time of check-in). However, we saw a contraction of the booking window throughout 2018 and 2019. Future changes in the length of the booking window will affect the degree to which our gross bookings and revenues occur in the same period and, as a result, whether our gross bookings growth rates and revenue growth rates converge or diverge.In addition, the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results. For example, in 2019, Easter fell on April 21 and Easter-related travel began in the second quarter, when the associated revenue was recognized. By comparison, in 2018, Easter was on April 1 and a meaningful amount of Easter-related travel began in the week leading up to the holiday with the associated revenue being recognized in the first quarter of 2018. As a result of the shift in Easter timing relative to 2018, our first quarter 2019 year-over-year growth rates in revenue, operating income and operating margins were negatively impacted and our second quarter 2019 year-over-year growth rates were positively impacted. The timing of other holidays such as Ramadan can also impact our quarterly year-over-year growth rates.The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business. For example, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable marketing expense. In addition, revenue growth is typically less impacted by decelerating gross bookings growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters, but any such deceleration would negatively impact revenue growth in subsequent periods. Conversely, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate accelerates, our operating margins are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable marketing expense. In addition, revenue growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term, but any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent periods as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters.Other FactorsWe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel and travel-related services. Factors beyond our control, such as oil prices, stock market volatility, terrorist attacks, unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, fires, droughts and volcanic eruptions, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as coronaviruses, Ebola and Zika, political instability, changes in economic conditions, wars and regional hostilities, imposition of taxes, tariffs or surcharges by regulatory authorities, changes in trade policies or trade disputes, changes in immigration policies or travel-related accidents or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel, can disrupt travel, limit the ability or willingness of travelers to visit certain locations or otherwise result in declines in travel demand. These kinds of events have negatively affected our business and results of operations in the past and may do so again in the future. Because these events or concerns, and the full impact of their effects, are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services and our relationships with travel service providers and other 41partners, any of which can adversely affect our business and results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. We have experienced pressure on operating margins as we invest in initiatives to drive future growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, acquisitions. As the overall size of our business has grown, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of services and technologies, including services and technologies that may be outside of our historical core business, and our ability to keep pace may slow. Potential competitors, such as emerging start-ups, may be able to innovate and focus on developing a particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new services or technologies before us. Some of our larger competitors or potential competitors have more resources or more established or diversified relationships with consumers than we do, and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, entering or investing in travel reservation businesses, investing in research and development, and competing aggressively for highly-skilled employees. For example, because consumers often utilize other online services more frequently than online travel services, a competitor or potential competitor that has established other, more frequent online interactions with consumers may be able to more easily or cost-effectively acquire customers for its online travel services than we can. Our goal is to grow revenue and achieve healthy operating margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain and highly competitive environment in which we operate makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth and profitability.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:•Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets. The application of the acquisition accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair value are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable. When we deem appropriate, we utilize assistance from a third-party valuation firm. The consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amounts allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date.We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. A substantial portion of our intangible assets and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable and KAYAK. At September 30, 2019, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill and that the fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values at September 30, 2019. Since the annual impairment test, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment to our goodwill. We review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon our ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. We did not identify any impairment indicators for our long-lived assets at December 31, 2019. 42•Income Taxes. We determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act""). The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. The Tax Act also introduced in 2018 a tax on 50% of global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI""), which is income determined to be in excess of a specified routine rate of return, and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (""BEAT"") aimed at preventing the erosion of the U.S. tax base. We have adopted an accounting policy to treat taxes on GILTI as period costs.In December 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") was issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when the registrant does not have all the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. In accordance with SAB 118, to the extent a registrant can reasonably estimate the effects of the Tax Act, a provisional tax amount can be recorded, but must have been finalized prior to December 22, 2018. In 2018, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act based on technical guidance issued by U.S. federal and state tax authorities available at that time, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $48 million. In 2019, as a result of additional technical guidance issued by U.S. federal and state tax authorities, we recorded an additional income tax benefit of $17 million to adjust our income tax expense relating to the U.S federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, as well as U.S state income taxes associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation. We do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject to U.S. taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to U.S. taxation as GILTI. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. To date, we have been audited in several taxing jurisdictions with no significant impact on our results of operations. Although we believe that our tax filing positions comply with applicable laws, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more-likely-than-not outcomes or we may adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Recent Accounting Pronouncements - See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details, which is incorporated into this Item 7 by reference thereto. 43Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates. Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-related services. Specifically, reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked through our OTC brands by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through our OTC brands by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. Our non-OTC brands (KAYAK and OpenTable) have different business metrics from those of our OTC brands and therefore search queries through KAYAK and restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not contribute to our gross bookings.Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 IncreaseRoom nights845 760 11.2%Rental car days77 73 4.6%Airline tickets7 7 3.7% Accommodation room night reservations increased by 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our investments in marketing channels, providing a continuously improving consumer experience and improving the accommodation choices we offer consumers, as well as the overall growth in the travel industry and the ongoing shift from offline to online for travel bookings. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was also positively impacted by a decrease in cancellation rates. Rental car day reservations increased by 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to an increase in rental car day reservations at Rentalcars.com as a result of the integration with Booking.com.Airline ticket reservations increased by 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the growth of priceline's vacation packages product.Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Increase (decrease)Agency$70,651 $73,919 (4.4)%Merchant25,791 18,812 37.1 %Total$96,443 $92,731 4.0 % Gross bookings increased by 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 8%), almost entirely due to growth of 11.2% in accommodation 44room night reservations, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a 2% decrease in accommodation ADRs on a constant-currency basis for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. We believe that unit growth rates and growth in total gross bookings on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the travel services provided. Agency gross bookings decreased by 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, almost entirely due to a decrease in gross bookings from agency accommodation room night reservations at Booking.com, primarily resulting from the growth of its merchant accommodation reservation services, as well as the aforementioned negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we facilitate payments from travelers for the travel services provided. Merchant gross bookings increased by 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, almost entirely due to growth in gross bookings from our merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com and agoda, partially offset by the aforementioned negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Booking.com has been expanding its merchant accommodation reservation services to, among other reasons, provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com and enable the growth of its in-destination activities businesses. RevenuesOnline travel reservation servicesSubstantially all of our revenues are generated by providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases between travel service providers and travelers. Revenues from online travel reservation services are classified into two categories: •Agency. Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided. Agency revenues consist almost entirely of travel reservation commissions. Substantially all of our agency revenue is from Booking.com agency accommodation reservations. •Merchant. Merchant revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided, generally at the time of booking. Merchant revenues include (1) travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our merchant reservation services; (2) credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees; and (3) ancillary fees, including travel-related insurance revenues and certain global distribution system (""GDS"") reservation booking fees. Substantially all merchant revenues are derived from transactions where travelers book accommodation reservations or rental car reservations. Advertising and other revenuesAdvertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (1) revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on its platforms; and (2) revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) restaurant reservation services (fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service) and (b) subscription fees for restaurant management services. Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Increase (decrease)Agency revenues$10,117 $10,480 (3.5)%Merchant revenues3,830 2,987 28.2 %Advertising and other revenues1,119 1,060 5.6 %Total revenues$15,066 $14,527 3.7 % 45Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, increased by 3.7% (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 7%). Substantially all of the year-over-year increase was related to revenues from our accommodation reservation services.Agency revenues decreased by 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, almost entirely due to decreased gross bookings from agency accommodation room night reservations at Booking.com, primarily resulting from the growth of its merchant accommodation reservation services. Merchant revenues increased by 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the increases in merchant accommodation reservation services. Advertising and other revenues increased by 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the inclusion of $67 million in revenue related to HotelsCombined for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4 million in revenue related to HotelsCombined since its acquisition in November 2018 for the year ended December 31, 2018.Total revenues as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 15.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our international businesses accounted for approximately $13.5 billion of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $13.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. Total revenues attributable to our international businesses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 4.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (growth on a constant-currency basis was approximately 8%). Total revenues attributable to our U.S. businesses were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.Operating Expenses Marketing Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Increase (decrease)Performance marketing$4,419 $4,447 (0.6)%% of Total revenues29.3% 30.6% Brand marketing$548 $509 7.5 %% of Total revenues3.6% 3.5% We rely on performance marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. Performance marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; and (4) other performance-based marketing and incentives. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our performance marketing expense growth rate was reduced by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and slowing growth in performance marketing channels. We adjust our performance marketing spend based on our growth and profitability objectives and the expected ROIs in our performance marketing channels. Performance marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to changes in the share of traffic by channel, primarily related to an increase in the share of direct traffic, and increased performance marketing ROIs.Brand marketing expenses consist primarily of television advertising and online video and display advertising (including the airing of our television advertising online), as well as other marketing spend such as public relations and sponsorships. For the year ended December 31, 2019, brand marketing expenses increased by 7.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased brand marketing expenses at Booking.com in the first half of 2019 in order to increase brand awareness and grow the number of customers that come directly to the Booking.com platforms. 46Sales and Other Expenses Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 IncreaseSales and other expenses$955 $830 15.1%% of Total revenues6.3% 5.7% Sales and other expenses consist primarily of: (1) credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) customer chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; (4) customer relations costs; and (5) provisions for bad debt, primarily related to agency accommodation commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales and other expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to increases in our merchant transaction volumes, partially offset by lower chargeback expense and lower bad debt provisions.Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 IncreasePersonnel$2,248 $2,042 10.0%% of Total revenues14.9% 14.1% Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes, and employee health and other benefits. Personnel expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in aggregate salaries of $132 million related to headcount growth to support our businesses, partially offset by lower bonus expenses. The increase in personnel expenses was also due to an accrual of $61 million recorded in 2019 to correct an immaterial error related to the nonpayment in prior periods of a wage-related tax under Netherlands' law on compensation paid to certain highly-compensated former employees in the year of their separation from employment with Booking.com. Stock-based compensation expense was $308 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $317 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Headcount increased, primarily at agoda and Booking.com, in the areas of customer service and information technology to support transaction growth and various business initiatives, such as alternative accommodations, marketing, payments and in-destination experiences.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 IncreaseGeneral and administrative$797 $699 14.2%% of Total revenues5.3% 4.8% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) personnel-related expenses such as travel, relocation, recruiting and training expenses; (3) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; and (4) indirect taxes such as travel transaction taxes and digital services taxes. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to increased professional fees, increased indirect taxes including $36 million related to French digital service taxes, higher occupancy and office expenses and personnel-related expenses associated with increased headcount and outside consultants to support the expansion of our international businesses. 47Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 IncreaseInformation technology$285 $233 22.3%% of Total revenues1.9% 1.6% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) outsourced data center and cloud computing costs; (3) payments to contractors; and (4) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services. Information technology expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to increased outsourced data center and cloud computing costs to support the growth in our businesses, software fees and payments to contractors.Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 IncreaseDepreciation and amortization$469 $426 10.0%% of Total revenues3.1% 2.9% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation of computer equipment; (3) amortization of internally-developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of increases of $22 million in data center equipment depreciation expenses and $18 million of internally-developed software amortization expenses due to higher capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs to support growth and geographic expansion.Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Increase (decrease)Interest income$152 $187 (18.5)%Interest expense(266) (269) (1.2)%Net unrealized gains (losses) on marketable equity securities745 (367) 302.7 %Foreign currency transactions and other(18) (57) (68.2)%Total$613 $(506) 221.2 % Interest income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower average invested balances of marketable securities and lower yields as well as increased usage of investments classified as cash equivalents.Net unrealized gains (losses) on marketable equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 principally related to our equity investments in Trip.com Group and Meituan Dianping (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). Foreign currency transactions and other includes foreign currency gains or losses on derivative contracts, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, including costs related to foreign currency transactions, and net realized gains or losses on investments and other income or expense. Foreign currency transactions and other includes foreign currency losses on derivative contracts of $19 million and $44 million and foreign currency transaction losses of $13 million and $9 million for 48the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, foreign currency transactions and other includes a net realized gain of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from sales of investments in debt securities.Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 IncreaseIncome tax expense$1,093 $837 30.6%% of Earnings before income taxes18.3% 17.3% Our 2019 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax (discussed below), partially offset by the effect of higher international tax rates and U.S. federal and state tax associated with our current year international earnings, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act, as well as certain non-deductible expenses. Our 2018 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax and the $46 million benefit resulting from the adjustment to our 2017 provisional income tax expense due to our completion of the accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act, partially offset by the effect of higher international tax rates and U.S. federal and state tax associated with our 2018 international earnings, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act, as well as certain non-deductible expenses. Our effective tax rate was higher for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of (1) higher U.S. gains from equity securities that contributed to a lower international jurisdictional earnings mix, which lessened the impact of the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax, and (2) the effect of the higher tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 to adjust our 2017 provisional income tax expense related to the Tax Act. These increases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by higher U.S. federal tax credits, lower U.S. federal and state tax associated with our current year international earnings, and certain lower non-deductible expenses. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment under Dutch tax law, which had a significant beneficial impact on our effective tax rates for those periods. In 2019, the Dutch government approved a reduction in its corporate income tax rate from 25% to 21.7%, effective in 2021. Furthermore, the Dutch government has proposed an increase in the Innovation Box Tax rate from 7% to 9%, which, if enacted, could be effective beginning in 2021. While we expect Booking.com to continue to qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatment with respect to a portion of its earnings for the foreseeable future, the loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit, whether due to a change in tax law or a determination by the Dutch government that Booking.com's activities are not innovative or for any other reason, would substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may not be able to maintain our 'Innovation Box Tax' benefit.""Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2019. 49Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2019, we had $11.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $4.7 billion is held by our international subsidiaries and is denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, Euros and, to a lesser extent, British Pounds Sterling and other currencies. Cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments are principally comprised of U.S. and international corporate bonds, U.S. and international government securities, money market funds, time deposits and certificates of deposit, convertible debt securities and American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") of Trip.com Group, Meituan Dianping equity securities and our investments in private companies. In August 2019, $500 million of Trip.com Group convertible notes were repaid on maturity. See Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, we made prepayments of $717 million and $774 million, respectively, which represent a portion of our Dutch income tax liability, to earn prepayment discounts. At December 31, 2019, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $1.1 billion as a result of the Tax Act, which included $1.0 billion reported as ""Long-term U.S. transition tax liability"" and $53 million included in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This liability will be paid over the next seven years. Generally, in accordance with the Tax Act, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by us. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In August 2019, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $80 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $100 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The proceeds of loans made under the facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayments. At December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding and $5 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. Upon entering into the new revolving credit facility in August 2019, we terminated the $2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility entered into in June 2015. We made several short-term borrowings under this prior revolving credit facility in the first half of 2019 totaling $400 million, all of which were repaid prior to June 30, 2019. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Our Convertible Senior Notes due June 2020 (the ""2020 Notes"") are reported as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019. The holders will have the right to convert all or any portion of the 2020 Notes starting on March 15, 2020 regardless of our stock price (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 4,444,944 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $8.2 billion. At December 31, 2019, we had a remaining aggregate amount of $11.5 billion authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock. We have continued to make repurchases of our common stock in the first quarter of 2020 and may continue to make additional repurchases of our common stock from time to time, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. In September 2016, we signed a turnkey agreement to construct an office building for Booking.com’s future headquarters in the Netherlands for 270 million Euros. Upon signing this agreement, we paid 43 million Euros for the acquired land-use rights. In addition, since signing the turnkey agreement we have made several progress payments principally related to the construction of the building. At December 31, 2019, we have a remaining obligation of 109 million Euros ($123 million) related to the building construction, which will be paid through mid-2022, when we anticipate construction will be complete. In addition to the turnkey agreement, we have a remaining obligation at December 31, 2019 to pay 71 million Euros ($80 million) over the remaining term of the acquired land lease. We will also make additional capital expenditures to fit out and furnish the office space. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash Flow AnalysisNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $473 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the payment of $403 million in 2019 to French tax authorities to preserve our right in order to contest certain tax assessments in court (see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $4.9 billion, resulting from net income of $4.9 billion and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $541 million, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $541 million. Non-cash items were 50principally associated with net unrealized gains on marketable equity securities, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, operating lease amortization and the provision for uncollectible accounts and chargebacks. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting the increase in business volume and growth in Booking.com's merchant transactions, were primarily related to a $480 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $323 million increase in accounts receivable and $263 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net change in other long-term assets and liabilities of $399 million was primarily due to the increase in other long-term assets related to the payment of $403 million to French tax authorities in order to preserve our right to contest the assessments in court (see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $5.3 billion, resulting from net income of $4.0 billion, a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.2 billion and a favorable net change in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $125 million. Non-cash items were principally associated with net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization and the provision for uncollectible accounts and chargebacks. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting the increase in business volume and growth in Booking.com's merchant transactions, were primarily related to a $635 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $319 million increase in accounts receivable and a $201 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.1 billion, principally resulting from the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $8.1 billion, net of purchases of $0.7 billion. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.2 billion, principally resulting from the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $5.6 billion, net of purchases of $2.7 billion, partially offset by acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, of $273 million. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment was $368 million and $442 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which primarily related to additional data center capacity and new offices to support growth and geographic expansion related to our Booking.com and agoda brands. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes payments of $51 million and $78 million, respectively, related to the turnkey agreement for constructing Booking.com's future headquarters. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $8.2 billion, almost entirely resulting from payments for the repurchase of common stock. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $7.4 billion, which primarily consisted of payments for the repurchase of common stock of $6.0 billion and payments for the conversion of senior notes of $1.5 billion. For a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and our cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2019.ContingenciesFrench tax authorities conducted an audit of Booking.com for the years 2003 through 2012 and are conducting audits for the years 2013 through 2018. They are asserting that Booking.com has a permanent establishment in France and are seeking to recover what they claim are unpaid income and value-added taxes. In December 2015, the French tax authorities issued Booking.com assessments related to tax years 2003 through 2012 for approximately 356 million Euros, the majority of which represents penalties and interest. As a result of a formal demand from the French tax authorities for payment of the amounts assessed for the years 2003 through 2012, in January 2019, we paid the assessments of approximately 356 million Euros ($403 million) in order to preserve our right to contest those assessments in court. The payment, which is included in ""Other assets"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019, does not constitute an admission that we owe the taxes and will be refunded (with interest) to us to the extent we prevail. If we are unable to resolve the matter with the French tax authorities, we plan to challenge the assessments in the French courts. In December 2019, the French tax authorities issued an additional assessment of 70 million Euros ($79 million), including interest and penalties, for the 2013 year asserting that Booking.com has taxable income in France attributable to a permanent establishment in France. Furthermore, the French tax authorities have issued assessments totaling 39 million Euros ($44 million), including interest and penalties, for certain tax years between 2011 and 2015 on Booking.com's French subsidiary asserting that the subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the services it rendered to Booking.com in the Netherlands. We have not recorded a liability in connection with any of the French tax assessments as we believe that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with French tax law, and we are contesting the assessments. Additional assessments could result when the French tax authorities complete the outstanding audits. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities."" 51Contractual Obligations and Commercial CommitmentsThe following table represents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2019: By Period (in millions) Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations(1) $690 $172 $251 $104 $163Building construction obligation(2) 123 55 68 — —Purchase obligations (3) 79 65 14 — —Senior notes(4) 9,639 1,170 3,293 1,867 3,309U.S. transition tax liability 1,074 53 198 308 515Letters of credit and bank guarantees(5) 160 118 23 1 18Revolving credit facility(6) 9 2 4 3 —Total(7) $11,774 $1,635 $3,851 $2,283 $4,005(1)Includes the land lease for Booking.com's future headquarters. See Notes 10 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.(2)See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.(3)Represents significant noncancellable contractual obligations individually greater than $10 million. The obligations are primarily related to sponsorship and cloud hosting arrangements.(4)Represents the aggregate principal amount of our senior notes outstanding at December 31, 2019 and cumulative interest to maturity of $928 million. Convertible debt does not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or shares of common stock at our option. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.(5)Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees issued on behalf of the Company at December 31, 2019 are primarily related to payment guarantees to third-party payment processors (see Notes 12 and 16). (6)Represents commitment fees on undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility and fees on outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2019.(7)We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $104 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019, the majority of which relates to unrecognized tax benefits of $51 million (see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). We have excluded these long-term liabilities from the contractual obligations table above as a variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for the liabilities; therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and, accordingly, we have classified the estimated liability as non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In 2018, we entered into an agreement to sign a future lease related to approximately 222,000 square feet of office space in the city of Manchester in the United Kingdom for the future headquarters of Rentalcars.com. Our obligation to execute the lease is conditional upon the lessor completing certain activities, which are expected to be completed in 2021. If these activities are completed, the lease will commence for a term of approximately 13 years and we will have a lease obligation of approximately 65 million British Pounds Sterling ($86 million), excluding lease incentives. We will also make capital expenditures to fit out and furnish the office space. The obligation is not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plans, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth 52or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have exposure to several types of market risk: changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices.We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign currency exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2019. Our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of approximately $23 million and $126 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity. This amount excludes our investments in Trip.com Group convertible senior notes, which are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of Trip.com Group's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") than changes in interest rates. The fair value of our Trip.com Group convertible senior notes will likely increase as the market price of Trip.com Group's ADSs increases and will likely decrease as the market price of Trip.com Group's ADSs falls. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was approximately $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively. We estimate that the fair value of such debt was approximately $9.8 billion and $9.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A substantial portion of the fair value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount relates to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible senior notes. Excluding the effect on the fair value of our convertible senior notes, a hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair values of our other debt of approximately $325 million and $370 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our convertible senior notes are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of our shares than changes in interest rates. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will likely increase as the market price of our shares increases and will likely decrease as the market price of our shares falls. Our international business represents a substantial majority of our financial results. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our international businesses are translated from local currencies (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currencies. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 53As a result of foreign currency exchange rate changes, our foreign-currency-denominated gross bookings, revenues and operating expenses as expressed in U.S. Dollars are lower for the year ended December 31, 2019 than they would have been had foreign currency exchange rates remained where they were for the year ended December 31, 2018. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. Historically, the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated debt and accrued interest thereon had provided a hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of one of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we have only designated certain portions of the aggregate principal value of the Euro-denominated debt as a hedge. The foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in ""Foreign currency transactions and other"" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge translation risks from short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the Euro, British Pound Sterling and certain other currencies versus the U.S. Dollar. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in fair value of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies. The fair value of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies, excluding certain investments classified as debt securities for accounting purposes, was $1.8 billion and $501 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019, and $1.0 billion and $501 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Our investments in private companies, excluding certain investments classified as debt securities for accounting purposes, are measured at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. See Note 2 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of these investments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 would have resulted in a total loss, before tax, of approximately $230 million and $150 million, respectively, being recognized in net income.",2023-12-30 18:44:27.264906
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2021,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include those discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.OverviewOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We seek to empower people to cut through travel barriers, such as money, time, language and overwhelming options, so they can use our services to easily and confidently go where they want to go, stay where they want to stay, dine where they want to dine, pay how they want to pay and experience what they want to experience. We connect consumers wishing to make travel reservations with providers of travel services around the world through our online platforms. Through one or more of our brands, consumers can: book a broad array of accommodations (including hotels, motels, resorts, homes, apartments, bed and breakfasts, hostels and other properties); make a car rental reservation or arrange for an airport taxi; make a dinner reservation; or book a flight, cruise, vacation package, tour or activity. Consumers can also use our meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information, such as airline ticket, hotel reservation and rental car reservation information, from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. In addition, we offer various other services to consumers and partners, such as certain travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services to restaurants. We offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK and OpenTable. While historically our brands operated on a largely independent basis and many of them focused on a particular service (e.g., accommodation reservations) or geography, we are increasing the collaboration, cooperation and interdependency among our brands in our efforts to provide consumers with the best and most comprehensive services. We also seek to maximize the benefits of our scale by sharing resources and technological innovations, co-developing new services and coordinating activities in key markets among our brands. For example, Booking.com, the world’s leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations (based on room nights booked), offers rental car and other ground transportation services, flights, tours and activities reservations, restaurant reservations and other services, many of which are supported by our other brands. Similarly, hotel reservations available through Booking.com are also generally available through agoda and Priceline. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Segment Reporting for information on our operating segments. We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands collectively as ""Booking Holdings,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us."" Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda and Rentalcars.com in their entirety and the international businesses of KAYAK and OpenTable. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com (which is domiciled in the Netherlands) at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the United States is part of our international results. In 2020, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 88% of our consolidated revenues. A significant majority of our revenues, including a significant majority of our international revenues, is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information. We derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees, advertising services, restaurant reservations and restaurant management services, and various other services, such as travel-related insurance revenues.41TrendsIn response to the outbreak of the novel strain of the coronavirus, COVID-19 (the ""COVID-19 pandemic""), many governments around the world have implemented, and continue to implement, a variety of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and bans, instructions to residents to practice social distancing, curfews, quarantine advisories, shelter-in-place orders and required closures of non-essential businesses. These government mandates have forced many of the partners on whom our business relies, including hotels and other accommodation providers, airlines and restaurants, to seek government support in order to continue operating, to curtail drastically their service offerings or to cease operations entirely. Further, these measures have materially adversely affected, and may further adversely affect, consumer sentiment and discretionary spending patterns, economies and financial markets, and our workforce, operations and customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions and government orders have resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and an unprecedented decline in travel and restaurant activities and consumer demand for related services. Our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been materially and negatively impacted, with a material decline in gross travel bookings, room nights booked, total revenues, net income and cash flow from operations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Newly-booked room night reservations, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic spread in the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter of 2020, but then steadily improved through the end of the second quarter and into the summer travel period in the third quarter of 2020. However, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we saw an increased decline in newly-booked room night reservations, due in part to increased COVID-19 case counts and reimposed or additional government-imposed travel restrictions, particularly in Europe. In September 2020, a variant of COVID-19 that spreads more easily and quickly than other variants was first discovered in the United Kingdom, and has since spread across the country and to other countries, including the United States and in Europe. Another variant of COVID-19 that also appears to spread more easily and quickly than other variants was detected in South Africa in October 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, multiple COVID-19 vaccines were approved for widespread distribution throughout various parts of the world, including the United States and in Europe. While this news is encouraging, it is still unknown when these vaccines will be available to broader populations and whether they will be as effective against variants of COVID-19, including the variants mentioned above. We believe that as effective vaccines become widely distributed, people will feel it is safe to travel again and government restrictions will be relaxed, although the timing remains uncertain.Since April 2020, we have seen a substantial year-over-year increase in the share of newly booked room nights booked for domestic travel (travelers booking a stay within their own country) while bookings for international travel have remained very limited throughout the pandemic. Over this same time period, we have seen a year-over-year increase in the share of our newly-booked room nights made on a mobile device. Also, while we saw an increase in the share of newly-booked room nights for alternative accommodation properties in the early months of the pandemic, more recently the share has been consistent with pre-pandemic levels. In addition, we have observed an improvement in cancellation rates since the high in April, though we have seen additional periods of highly elevated cancellation rates typically coinciding with newly imposed travel restrictions. The overall improvement in cancellation rates since April benefits our room nights booked including cancellations but does not impact newly-booked room nights.Our revenue decline in 2020 was impacted to a greater extent than newly-booked room night growth due to the impact of higher cancellations and lower accommodation average daily rates (""ADRs"") as compared to 2019. We expect to continue to see severely reduced new travel and restaurant reservation bookings as compared to 2019 levels for the foreseeable future, which will have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, given the volatility in the global travel industry and the financial difficulties faced by many of our travel service provider and restaurant partners, we have increased our provision for expected credit losses on receivables from and cash advances made to our travel service provider and restaurant partners.Due to the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of current conditions around the world, we are unable to predict accurately the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business going forward. The approval and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines throughout the world is encouraging, however, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact global travel and travel restrictions remain in place, particularly in Europe. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we saw room nights decline further, as well as an increase in cancellation rates, in each case as compared to the third quarter of 2020. In January 2021, room nights declined slightly more than the decline in the fourth quarter of 2020, however, we have seen some improvement in these booking trends in recent weeks. If these recent trends were to continue, we currently expect that room nights and gross bookings in the first quarter of 2021 will decline relative to the first quarter of 2019 by a few percentage points less than those metrics declined in the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. We currently expect revenue in the first quarter of 2021 to decline by a similar amount as our expected decline in gross bookings in the first quarter of 2021, both relative to the first quarter of 2019. The comparison of the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2019 avoids the distortion created from comparing to the initial spread of the COVID-19 pandemic late in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, we 42currently expect that we will experience a greater operating loss in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. With the continued spread of COVID-19 throughout the world, we expect the pandemic and its effects to continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic, during any resurgences of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be an extended period of time. For more information, see Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""The COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely affected, and may further adversely impact, our business and financial performance."" In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken and are taking various actions to address the impact of the pandemic on our business. Among other actions, we have:•Raised $4.1 billion in debt and negotiated amendments to our revolving credit facility to provide additional financial flexibility•Undertaken restructuring activities at all of our brands•Participated in certain government aid programs, including employee wage support programs•Suspended general share repurchases•Eliminated non-essential business travel•Canceled internal company events and offsites•Significantly reduced marketing spend worldwide•Implemented a general temporary company-wide hiring freeze for much of 2020•Sold investments in government debt securities, corporate debt securities and Trip.com Group American DepositaryShares (""ADSs"")Further, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Executive Officers of our brands voluntarily declined their salaries, certain other senior managers voluntarily reduced their salaries and our non-employee Directors voluntarily waived their cash fees for most of 2020.In response to the reduction in our business volumes as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we took actions at all of our brands to reduce the size of our workforce to optimize efficiency and reduce costs, which we expect to result in annualized cost savings of approximately $370 million in personnel-related expenses. In addition to the restructuring expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 and included in “Restructuring and other exit costs” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, we estimate that we will record approximately $40 million of additional restructuring expenses in early 2021 (see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Our headcount decreased 23% year-over-year as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to the restructuring activities and attrition.We have also been working with travelers and our travel service provider partners to deal with reservation cancellations and other disruptions arising from the impact of the pandemic. For example, when the pandemic started, Booking.com committed to allow cancellations of certain non-refundable bookings that were impacted by government travel restrictions and OpenTable has waived fees payable by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service and subscription fees for many restaurants. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are wide-ranging and affect all aspects of our business. As a result, the pandemic has negatively affected our financial results and condition as described throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We anticipate that we will continue to make decisions and take actions to address the impacts of the pandemic on our business, including additional efforts to reduce costs while preserving our ability to offer valuable services to consumers and partners when the industry recovers. The full impact of the pandemic on our business is impossible to predict, and therefore we may recognize additional negative impacts to our operating results and financial condition in future periods as a result of the pandemic.Certain governments have passed or are considering modifying legislation to help businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic through loans, wage subsidies, tax relief or other financial aid, and some of these governments have extended or are considering extending these programs. We have participated in several of these programs, including the Netherlands' wage subsidy program and the United Kingdom's job retention scheme. In addition, certain governments have extended support for the travel and tourism industry through special programs whereby discounts are extended to travelers through travel service providers or through travel agents for reservations facilitated by them. We have participated in Japan's Go To Travel program and Thailand's We Travel Together program.43Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced many years of significant growth in our accommodation reservation services. We believe this growth was the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the widespread adoption of mobile devices and the growth of travel overall. We also believe this growth was the result of the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to increase the number and the variety of accommodations we offer consumers, increase and improve content, build distribution and improve the consumer experience on our online platforms, as well as consistently and effectively marketing our brands through performance and brand marketing efforts. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these year-over-year growth rates generally decelerated due to the size of our accommodation reservation business and the generally slowing growth rate of the online travel market. As the travel market recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see higher than pre-COVID-19 pandemic growth rates until we return to the level of travel market demand that we observed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, after which we expect prior trends to generally resume. We are a global business, and online travel growth rates vary across the world depending on numerous factors, including local and regional economic conditions, individual disposable income, access to the internet and adoption of e-commerce. Over the last several years, and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, online travel growth rates had generally slowed in markets such as North America and Europe where online activity was high and consumers had been engaging in e-commerce transactions for many years, while online travel growth rates remained relatively high in markets such as Asia-Pacific where incomes were rising more quickly and the increased availability and use of mobile devices had accelerated the growth of internet usage and travel e-commerce transactions. Over the long term, we expect the broader global economy and online travel market to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, and following the recovery of the travel industry to the level of pre-COVID-19 pandemic demand, we would expect online travel growth rates will slow as markets continue to mature. However, we believe that the opportunity to grow our business beyond pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels exists for the markets in which we operate, including in both mature and less mature markets. Further, we believe that this opportunity for growth exists because we believe we provide significant value to travel service providers, regardless of size or geography, due to our global reach and marketing expertise. For example, we believe that accommodation providers of all sizes, from large hotel chains to small, independent hotels and alternative accommodations such as homes and apartments, benefit from using our services, which enable them to reach a broader audience of potential customers.Historically, our growth has primarily been generated by the worldwide accommodation reservation business of Booking.com, which is our most significant brand, and has been due, in part, to the availability of a large number of properties through Booking.com. Booking.com included approximately 2,373,000 properties on its website at December 31, 2020, consisting of approximately 434,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 1,939,000 homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, compared to approximately 2,580,000 properties (including approximately 460,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 2,120,000 homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay) at December 31, 2019. Booking.com categorizes properties listed on its website as either (a) hotels, motels and resorts, which groups together more traditional accommodation types (including hostels and inns), or (b) homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, also referred to as alternative accommodations, which encompasses all other types of accommodations, including bed and breakfasts, villas, apart-hotels and beyond. We intend to continue to improve the accommodation choices available for reservation on our platforms, however, the number of accommodations on our platforms may vary in part as a result of removing accommodations from time to time. At December 31, 2020, we saw a year-over-year decrease in the number of properties on Booking.com’s website, as compared to December 31, 2019, driven by an elevated number of accommodations removed from the platform due primarily to the properties not providing availability on our platforms, non-payment of invoices, or property closures. We have continued to see a year-over-year increase in the number of accommodations removed from our platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to see further accommodation removals in the future due to increases in property closures or changes in ownership.Many of the newer accommodations we add to our travel reservation services, especially in highly-penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms or higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of consumers (e.g., hostels and bed and breakfasts). Because alternative accommodations are often either a single unit or a small collection of independent units, these properties generally represent more limited booking opportunities than hotels, motels and resorts, which generally have more units to rent per property. Further, alternative accommodations in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism seasons or other factors or may not be available at peak times due to use by the property owners. We may also experience lower profit margins with respect to these properties due to certain additional costs, such as increased customer service costs, related to offering these accommodations on our platforms. As our alternative accommodation business has grown, these different characteristics have negatively impacted our profit margins and we expect this trend to continue. Further, to the extent that these properties represent an increasing percentage of the properties on our platforms, the number of reservations per property will likely continue to decrease since alternative accommodation properties typically have fewer 44booking opportunities per property. We believe that continuing to improve the choices of accommodations available through our services, in particular Booking.com, will help us to continue to grow our accommodation reservation business.We are constantly innovating to grow our business by, among other things, providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms (i.e., websites and mobile apps) to ensure that we are meeting the needs of online consumers while aiming to exceed their expectations. As part of these ongoing efforts, we have a long-term strategy to build a more integrated offering of multiple elements of travel, which we refer to as the ""Connected Trip"", and we expect these efforts to increase room night growth and revenue growth over time. Although we expect our efforts to build the Connected Trip will increase revenue growth over time, we may see a negative impact on our operating margins in the near term as we incur the expenses associated with these investments. Further, to the extent our non-accommodation services grow faster than our accommodation services, whether as part of the Connected Trip or otherwise, our operating margins may be negatively affected if we experience an increasing mix of revenues from lower-margin services. As part of our strategy to provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com and enable the growth of our in-destination activities businesses, Booking.com is increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis, where it facilitates payments from travelers for the services provided. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer secure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that adding these types of service offerings will benefit consumers and travel service providers, as well as our gross bookings, room night and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional expenses for personnel, payment processing, customer chargebacks (including those related to fraud) and other expenses related to these transactions, which are recorded in ""Personnel"" and ""Sales and other expenses"" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as associated incremental revenues in the form of credit card rebates, for example, which are recorded in ""Merchant revenues."" To the extent more of our business is generated on a merchant basis, we will incur a greater level of these merchant-related expenses, which would negatively impact our operating margins despite increases in associated incremental revenues. Components of revenues and expenses related to our merchant business may be recognized in different periods. These timing factors could impact our operating margins as well as the relationship between our gross bookings and revenues in a particular period, especially as our merchant business increases as a percentage of our overall business.We compete globally with both online and traditional providers of travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data and financial and other resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market and has grown rapidly in this area, including by offering a flight meta-search product (Google Flights), a hotel meta-search product (Google Hotel Ads), a vacation rental meta-search product, its ""Book on Google"" reservation functionality, Google Travel, a planning tool that aggregates its flight, hotel and packages products in one website and by integrating its hotel meta-search products and restaurant information and reservation products into its Google Maps app. Moreover, as the economy and the travel industry recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the structure of the travel industry could change in unexpected ways, which could advantage or disadvantage us and benefit certain of our existing competitors or new entrants. As a result, our historical strengths may not provide the competitive advantages that they did prior to the pandemic. If we are unable to successfully adapt to any changes in how the travel industry operates or to changes in the ways in which consumers purchase travel services, our ability to compete, and therefore our business and results of operations, would be adversely affected.Our markets are also subject to rapidly changing conditions, including technological developments, consumer behavior changes, regulatory changes and travel service provider consolidation. We expect these trends to continue. For example, we have experienced a significant shift of both direct and indirect business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. In addition, the revenue earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay, have lower accommodation ADRs and are not made as far in advance. We observed an increasingly higher share of our newly-booked room nights made on a mobile device throughout 2020, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2019. For more detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face, see Part I, Item 1, Business - ""Competition,"" Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance."" and ""Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates challenges and may enable device companies such as Google and Apple to compete directly with us."" and ""We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes."" 45Although we believe that providing an extensive collection of properties, excellent customer service and an intuitive, easy-to-use consumer experience are important factors influencing a consumer's decision to make a reservation, for many consumers, particularly in certain markets, the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether a consumer will book a reservation. As a result, it is increasingly important to offer travel services, such as accommodation reservations, at competitive prices, whether through discounts, coupons, closed-user group rates or loyalty programs, or otherwise. These initiatives have resulted and in the future may result in lower ADRs and lower revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. Discounting and couponing coupled with a high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in Asian markets. In some cases, our competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction, or offer travel services at a loss, in order to gain market share.We have experienced a meaningful decline in constant-currency accommodation ADRs since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is uncertain how long the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our ADRs. These declining ADR trends have resulted in and may continue to result in our gross bookings growing at a lower rate of growth than our accommodation room nights. Prior to the outbreak, we observed a trend of declining constant-currency accommodation ADRs. We believe the trend of declining ADRs, observed prior to the outbreak, was partially driven by the negative impact of the changing geographical mix of our business (e.g., lower ADR regions like Asia-Pacific are generally growing faster than higher ADR regions like Western Europe) as well as pricing pressures within local markets from time to time which resulted from competitive conditions, weakening economic conditions or changes in travel patterns. As the travel market recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect travel industry ADRs generally to increase and, as a result, we expect our ADRs similarly to increase during the recovery, however, it is uncertain whether industry ADRs will improve at the same pace as travel demand. In addition, we expect the ADR trends we observed before the COVID-19 pandemic will generally resume after the recovery, which would negatively pressure our ADRs, however, there may also be periods of stable or increasing ADRs.We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Historically, our marketing expenses increased significantly, however, we experienced more moderate growth rates in recent years, and since the COVID-19 pandemic, our marketing expenses have declined significantly. Our marketing expense is comprised of performance marketing and brand marketing expenses. Our performance marketing expense, which represents a substantial majority of our marketing expense, is primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our websites. Our brand marketing expense is primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing television advertising, online video advertising (for example, on YouTube and Facebook), online display advertising and other brand marketing. Total marketing expenses were $2.2 billion and $5.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect that our marketing expenses in 2021 will remain significantly below 2019 levels.Marketing efficiency, expressed as marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues, is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are, in some cases, outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers, the timing difference between when revenue is recognized and when marketing expense is recorded, the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns and the extent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings. For example, competition for desired rankings in search results and/or a decline in ad clicks by consumers could increase our costs per click and reduce our marketing efficiency. Changes by Google or any of our other search or meta-search partners in how it presents travel search results, including, if applicable, by placing its own offerings at or near the top of search results, or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites. We have observed a long-term trend of decreasing performance marketing returns on investment (""ROIs""), however, in recent years, we observed periods of stable or increasing ROIs. During the first several months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced large year-over-year declines in ROIs driven by a significant increase in cancellation rates. While we have observed year-over-year decreases in ROIs for the year ended December 31, 2020, ROIs have improved since the early months of the pandemic, though we expect volatility in our ROIs for the duration of the pandemic. When evaluating our performance marketing spend, we typically consider several factors for each channel, such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incrementality of the traffic we receive and the anticipated repeat rate from a particular platform, as well as other factors. However, with the significant decrease in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our performance marketing spend is highly influenced by expected cancellation rates in addition to the other factors listed above. The amount of business we obtain through each performance marketing channel is impacted by numerous factors, including the level of consumer demand for travel, bidding decisions by us and our competitors (including decisions to optimize performance marketing ROIs) and the marketing efforts and success of those channels to attract consumers and generate demand. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our platforms and grow our business."" and ""Our 46business could be negatively affected by changes in online search and meta-search algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.""In recent years, we experienced significant increases in our cancellation rates, which negatively affected our marketing efficiency and results of operations. However, from the third quarter of 2018 until the fourth quarter of 2019, our cancellation rates generally decreased, which benefited our marketing efficiency and results of operations. Since the COVID-19 pandemic we have experienced unprecedented increases in cancellation rates, which negatively impacted our marketing efficiency and results of operations. For example, increased cancellations, especially early in the pandemic, have resulted in increased customer service costs, as well as higher than normal cash outlays to refund consumers for prepaid reservations. However, in the second and third quarters of 2020, we saw a steady improvement in cancellation rates, which trended towards levels that we observed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we saw a reversal of the improving cancellation rate trend. We expect to continue to see volatility in cancellation rates due to any resurgences of the pandemic leading to reinstituted or additional travel restrictions, shelter-in-place rules and reduced willingness to travel. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2020, a higher share of our newly-booked room night reservations were made with flexible cancellation policies, as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, which could result in higher than normal cancellation rates in future quarters.Perceived or actual adverse economic conditions, including slow, slowing or negative economic growth, high or rising unemployment rates, inflation and weakening currencies, and concerns over government responses such as higher taxes or tariffs and reduced government spending have impaired and could, in the future, impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. We expect the lingering concerns of consumers around the safety of traveling as well as reduced discretionary incomes could negatively impact leisure travel demand for an extended period of time. Further, political uncertainty, conditions or events, such as the variety of measures implemented by many governments around the world to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and bans, instructions to residents to practice social distancing, quarantine advisories, shelter-in-place orders and required closures of non-essential businesses can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand. At times, we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates, increased cancellation rates and weaker trends in ADRs across many regions of the world, particularly in those countries that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainties, which we believe are due at least in part to these macro-economic conditions and concerns. For more detail, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""The COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely affected, and may further adversely impact, our business and financial performance"" and ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""These and other macro-economic uncertainties, such as geopolitical tensions and differing central bank monetary policies, have led to periods of significant volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and other currencies. Significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, stock markets and oil prices can also impact consumer travel behavior. As noted earlier, our international business represents a substantial majority of our financial results. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our international businesses are translated from local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. As a result, both the absolute amounts of and percentage changes in our foreign-currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate changes. However, for the year ended December 31, 2020, movements in foreign currency exchange rates had little to no impact on our performance metrics and financial results. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. We designate certain portions of the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated debt as a hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of one of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in ""Other income (expense), net"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the amount of net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiary, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.""We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In periods prior to the second quarter of 2020, we also entered into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated operating results into U.S. Dollars. However, these instruments were short-term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuations that could impact growth rates for our gross bookings or revenues. Since the first quarter of 2020, we have not entered into such derivative instruments as the impact of the 47COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results are highly uncertain. We will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instruments in the future. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our derivative contracts.Many taxing authorities are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues and have targeted large multinational technology companies in these efforts. As a result, many countries have implemented or are considering the adoption of a digital services tax that imposes a tax on revenue earned from digital advertisements and the use of online platforms, even when there is no physical presence in the jurisdiction. Currently, rates for this tax range from 1.5% to 7.5% of revenue deemed generated in the jurisdiction. The digital services taxes currently in effect, which we record in ""General and administrative"" expense in Consolidated Statements of Operations, have negatively impacted our results of operations and if many other countries pass similar legislation, the collective impact of all of these measures could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""Many national governments have conducted or are conducting investigations into competitive practices within the online travel industry, and we may be involved or affected by such investigations and their results. Some countries have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practices within the online travel industry. For example, France, Italy, Belgium and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety. Also, a number of governments are investigating or conducting information-gathering exercises with respect to compliance by online travel companies (""OTCs"") with consumer protection laws, including practices related to the display of search results and search ranking algorithms, claims regarding discounts, disclosure of charges and availability, and similar messaging. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be ""gatekeepers."" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not known what the laws will look like in their final forms if adopted. If the regulators were to determine that we are a gatekeeper under the proposed legislation, we could be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed. For more information on these investigations and their potential effects on our business, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Our business is subject to various competition/anti-trust, consumer protection and online commerce laws, rules and regulations around the world, and as the size of our business grows, scrutiny of our business by legislators and regulators in these areas may intensify."" In addition to the price parity and consumer protection investigations, from time to time national competition authorities, other governmental agencies, trade associations and private parties take legal actions, including commencing legal proceedings, that may affect our operations. In general, increased regulatory focus on online businesses, including online travel businesses like ours, could result in increased compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. Seasonality and Other Timing FactorsIn recent years, the majority of our gross bookings have been generated in the first half of the year, as consumers planned and reserved their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. However, we would generally recognize revenue from these bookings when the travel begins (at ""check-in""), which can be in a quarter other than when the associated reservations are booked. In contrast, we expensed the substantial majority of our marketing activities as the expense is incurred, which, in the case of marketing in particular, is typically in the quarter in which associated reservations were booked. As a result of this timing difference between when we recorded marketing expense and when we recognized associated revenue, we have experienced our highest levels of profitability in the third quarter of the year, which is when we experienced the highest levels of accommodation check-ins for the year for our European and North American markets. The first quarter of the year was typically the quarter in which we recognized the lowest amount of revenue as well as the lowest level of profitability and highest level of volatility in earnings growth rates due to these seasonal timing factors. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted seasonality in 2020; for example, we witnessed a higher share of travel being booked during the second and third quarters as well as a higher share of stays during the third quarter than in prior years. We cannot currently predict travel patterns given the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may not experience typical seasonality effects on our business in 2021.For several years, we experienced an expansion of the booking window (the average time between the booking of a travel reservation and when the travel begins), which impacts the relationship between our gross bookings (recognized at the time of booking) and our revenues (recognized at the time of check-in). However, we saw a contraction of the booking window throughout 2018 and 2019. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our booking trends, we saw an initial expansion in the booking window in the second quarter versus the comparable prior-year period as an increased percentage of newly-booked room nights were made for travel occurring in the third quarter. However, in the third and fourth quarters, we saw a significant contraction of the booking window versus the comparable prior-year period as an increased percentage of newly-48booked room nights were made for travel that was to occur close to the time of booking. We expect that the length of the booking window will be volatile and difficult to predict throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future changes in the length of the booking window will affect the degree to which our gross bookings and revenues occur in the same period and, as a result, whether our gross bookings growth rates and revenue growth rates converge or diverge.In addition, the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results. For example, in 2019, Easter fell on April 21 and Easter-related travel began in the second quarter, when the associated revenue was recognized. By comparison, in 2018, Easter was on April 1 and a meaningful amount of Easter-related travel began in the week leading up to the holiday with the associated revenue being recognized in the first quarter of 2018. As a result of the shift in Easter timing relative to 2018, our first quarter 2019 year-over-year growth rates in revenue, operating income and operating margins were negatively impacted and our second quarter 2019 year-over-year growth rates were positively impacted. In 2020, Easter fell on April 12, in the second quarter as it did in 2019, and as a result we did not experience a meaningful impact to our year-over-year growth rates in 2020 from the Easter holiday. Due to the significant reduction in travel demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not expect the timing of the Easter holiday to have a meaningful impact on our growth rates in 2021. The timing of other holidays such as Ramadan can also impact our quarterly year-over-year growth rates.The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business. For example, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable marketing expense. In addition, revenue growth is typically less impacted by decelerating gross bookings growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters, but any such deceleration would negatively impact revenue growth in subsequent periods. Conversely, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate accelerates, our operating margins are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable marketing expense. In addition, revenue growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term, but any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent periods as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters. As the travel market recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see higher than pre-COVID-19 pandemic growth rates, which will likely result in periods where our operating margins are negatively impacted due to the timing difference of when marketing expense is recorded and when revenue is recognized. Other FactorsWe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel and travel-related services. Factors beyond our control, such as oil prices, stock market volatility, terrorist attacks, unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, fires, droughts and volcanic eruptions, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, Ebola and Zika, political instability, changes in economic conditions, wars and regional hostilities, imposition of taxes, tariffs or surcharges by regulatory authorities, changes in trade policies or trade disputes, changes in immigration policies or travel-related accidents or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel, can disrupt travel, limit the ability or willingness of travelers to visit certain locations or otherwise result in declines in travel demand. These kinds of events have negatively affected our business and results of operations in the past and may do so again in the future. Because these events or concerns, and the full impact of their effects, are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services and our relationships with travel service providers and other partners, any of which can adversely affect our business and results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""The COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely affected, and may further adversely impact, our business and financial performance"" and ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. We expect the pandemic and its effects to continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be an extended period of time. Over the long-term, we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. In recent years, we have experienced pressure on operating margins as we invested in initiatives to drive future growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, acquisitions. We believe competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of services and technologies, including services and technologies that may be outside of our historical core business, and our ability to keep pace may slow. Potential competitors, such as emerging start-ups, may be able to innovate and focus on developing a particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new services or technologies before us. Some of our larger competitors or potential 49competitors have more resources or more established or diversified relationships with consumers than we do, and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, entering or investing in travel reservation businesses, investing in research and development, and competing aggressively for highly-skilled employees. For example, because consumers often utilize other online services more frequently than online travel services, a competitor or potential competitor that has established other, more frequent online interactions with consumers may be able to more easily or cost-effectively acquire customers for its online travel services than we can. Our goal is to grow revenue and achieve healthy operating margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain and highly competitive environment in which we operate makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we may not be able to return to the levels of revenue growth and profitability we experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets The application of the acquisition accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair value are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable. When we deem appropriate, we utilize assistance from a third-party valuation firm. The consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amounts allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date.A substantial portion of our intangible assets and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable and KAYAK. We review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. Due to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed the recoverability test of our long-lived assets and concluded there was no impairment at March 31, 2020. For OpenTable and KAYAK, we tested the recoverability of the long-lived assets and concluded there was no impairment at September 30, 2020. We did not identify any additional impairment indicators for our long-lived assets at December 31, 2020. We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level. Our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. Interim Goodwill Impairment TestDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020. Under the current goodwill impairment standard adopted in the first quarter of 2020, a goodwill impairment loss is measured at the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). As of March 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units, except the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit, substantially exceeded its respective carrying value. For the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-50deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.The estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples).The income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed that OpenTable and KAYAK will experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches).Annual Goodwill Impairment TestAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test. Other than the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit, the fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values. For the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services. The estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples). The income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we expected a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within the next five years, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations. An increase or decrease of one percentage point to the profitability growth rates used in the cash flow projections would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $100 million to the estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK at September 30, 2020. The discount rate is determined based on the reporting unit’s estimated weighted-average cost of capital and adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in its cash flows, which requires significant judgments. The discount rate used for the annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2020 is higher than the discount rate used for the interim goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020. If the discount rate used in the income approach increases or decreases by 0.5%, the impact to the estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK, at September 30, 2020, ranges from a decrease of approximately $65 million to an increase of approximately $70 million.The estimation of fair value reflects numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including key assumptions regarding OpenTable and KAYAK’s expected growth rates and operating margin, expected length and severity of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery and the competitive environment, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates and market comparables. It requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than the judgments and estimates used to estimate fair value. Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in the current forecast disclosed above, particularly the assumptions related to the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery, which may result in a need to recognize an additional goodwill impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.51No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2020. Valuation of Investments in Private CompaniesSee Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the investments in private companies. The fair value of these investments are measured using unobservable inputs when little or no market data is available (""Level 3 inputs""). See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our investments measured using Level 3 inputs primarily consist of preferred stock investments in privately-held companies that are classified as either debt securities or equity securities without readily determinable fair values. Fair values of privately held securities are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies, including both market and income approaches. We have used valuation techniques appropriate for the type of investment and the information available about the investee as of the valuation date to determine fair value. Recent financing transactions in the investee, such as new investments in preferred stock, are generally considered the best indication of the enterprise value and therefore used as a basis to estimate fair value. However, based on a number of factors, such as the proximity in timing to the valuation date or the volume or other terms of these financing transactions, we may also use other valuation techniques to supplement this data, including the income approach. In addition, an option-pricing model (“OPM”) is utilized to allocate value to the various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model includes assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.Our investment in Grab, which is classified as a debt security for accounting purposes, had an aggregate estimated fair value of $200 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We measured this investment using ""Level 3"" inputs and management's estimates that incorporate current market participant expectations of future cash flows considered alongside recent financing transactions of the investee and other relevant information.We performed an impairment analysis on the investment in Didi Chuxing at March 31, 2020 considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in an adjusted carrying value of $400 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2020. As discussed below, we used unobservable inputs in order to determine fair value. We used an income approach in estimating the fair value of Didi Chuxing as of March 31, 2020. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on a company’s weighted- average cost of capital, and is adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in its cash flows. The key unobservable inputs and ranges used include the weighted average cost of capital (12%-14%), terminal Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) multiple (13x-15x), volatility (60%-70%) and an estimated time to liquidity of 4 years. Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly different fair value measurements. Generally, a change in the assumption used for terminal EBITDA multiples would result in a directionally similar change in the fair value and a change in the assumption used for weighted average cost of capital or volatility would result in a directionally opposite change in the fair value. The determination of the fair values of investments, where we are a minority shareholder and have access to limited information from the investee, reflects numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including key assumptions regarding the investee’s expected growth rates and operating margin, expected length and severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the investee and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates and market comparables. It requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates utilized in the fair value estimate. Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in our valuation, particularly the assumptions related to the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery and the overall impact on the investee’s business, which may result in a need to recognize an additional impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Income Taxes We determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") enacted in December 2017 made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. 52We do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject to U.S. taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to U.S. taxation as GILTI. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. We have been audited in many jurisdictions and, from time to time, face challenges from the tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and comply with applicable law, we regularly review our tax filing positions, especially in light of tax law or business practice changes, and we may change our positions or determine that previous positions should be amended, either of which could result in additional tax liabilities. The final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The evaluation of tax positions and recognition of income tax benefits require significant judgment and we consult with external tax and legal counsel, as appropriate. We consider the technical merits of our tax positions along with the applicable tax statutes, related interpretations and precedents and our expectation of the outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with tax authorities. We recognize liabilities when we believe that uncertain positions may not be fully sustained upon audit by the tax authorities, including any related appeals or litigation processes. Liabilities recognized for uncertain tax positions are based on a two-step approach for recognition and measurement. First, we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. Second, we measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties attributable to uncertain tax positions, if any, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The tax benefits ultimately realized by us may be different than what is recorded in the financial statements due to future events such as our settling the matter with the tax authorities and our success in sustaining our tax positions. See Notes 15 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.ContingenciesLoss contingencies (other than income tax-related contingencies disclosed above) arise from actual or possible claims and assessments and pending or threatened litigation that may be brought against us by individuals, governments or other entities. Based on our assessment of loss contingencies at each balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial statements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose information about the contingency in the financial statements. We also disclose information in our financial statements about reasonably possible loss contingencies. The determination of whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated requires significant judgment and evaluation of all the underlying facts and circumstances, including judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants, regulatory authorities and courts. Claims, assessments and litigations involve significant uncertainties such as the complexity of the facts, the legal theories involved, the nature of the claims, the judgment of the courts, the applicable methodology for determining potential damages and, in the case of class actions, whether a class action can be certified, the extent to which members of a class would or would not file a claim and the uncertainty inherent in class actions.On a quarterly basis, we update our analysis and estimates considering all available information, including the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings and advice of legal counsel. Changes in our assessment of whether a loss is probable, our estimate of the loss, or our determination of whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Changes in our assumptions regarding a particular matter or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal and other proceedings could also have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. For all loss contingencies, until a matter is finally resolved, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the liability accrued for the matter and such amounts could be material.See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Recent Accounting Pronouncements - See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details, which is incorporated into this Item 7 by reference thereto.53Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates. Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-related services. Specifically, reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked through our OTC brands by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through our OTC brands by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. Our non-OTC brands (KAYAK and OpenTable) have different business metrics from those of our OTC brands and therefore search queries through KAYAK and restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not contribute to our gross bookings.Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Room nights355 845 (58.0)%Rental car days31 77 (59.8)%Airline tickets6 7 (21.6)% Accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets reserved through our services each declined for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove a substantial decline in new travel bookings and increased cancellation rates. Gross bookings resulting from reservations of accommodation room nights, rental car days and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Agency$24,475 $70,651 (65.4)%Merchant10,920 25,791 (57.7)%Total$35,395 $96,443 (63.3)% Gross bookings decreased by 63.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (decreased on a constant-currency basis by approximately 63%), almost entirely due to the 58.0% decline in accommodation room night reservations, as well as a decline in accommodation ADRs of approximately 14% on a constant-currency basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. We believe that unit growth rates and growth in total gross bookings on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, are important measures to understand the fundamental performance of the business.Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the travel services provided. Agency gross bookings decreased by 65.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, almost entirely due to a decrease in gross bookings from agency accommodation room night reservations at Booking.com.54Merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we facilitate payments from travelers for the travel services provided. Merchant gross bookings decreased by 57.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, principally due to a decrease in gross bookings from our merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com, agoda and Priceline. Merchant gross bookings for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, declined less than agency gross bookings due to the stronger growth of merchant gross bookings early in the year as Booking.com had been expanding its merchant accommodation reservation services prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as due to relatively better performance from our merchant travel reservation services at Priceline. RevenuesOnline travel reservation servicesSubstantially all of our revenues are generated by providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases between travel service providers and travelers. Revenues from online travel reservation services are classified into two categories: •Agency. Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided. Agency revenues consist almost entirely of travel reservation commissions. Substantially all of our agency revenue is from Booking.com agency accommodation reservations. •Merchant. Merchant revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided, generally at the time of booking. Merchant revenues include (1) travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our merchant reservation services; (2) credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees; and (3) ancillary fees, including travel-related insurance revenues. Substantially all merchant revenues are derived from transactions where travelers book accommodation reservations or rental car reservations. Advertising and other revenuesAdvertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (1) revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on its platforms; and (2) revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) restaurant reservation services (fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service) and (b) subscription fees for restaurant management services. Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Agency revenues$4,314 $10,117 (57.4)%Merchant revenues2,117 3,830 (44.7)%Advertising and other revenues365 1,119 (67.3)%Total revenues$6,796 $15,066 (54.9)%Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, decreased by 54.9% (decreased on a constant-currency basis by approximately 55%). A significant majority of the year-over-year decrease was related to revenues from our accommodation reservation services. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by a reduction in revenue of $44 million for refunds paid or estimated to be payable to travelers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic where we agreed to provide free cancellation for certain non-refundable reservations without a corresponding estimated expected recovery from the travel service providers (see Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by additional rebates of approximately $100 million offered to travel service providers meeting certain eligibility requirements under an incentive program that ended in 2020 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).55Agency revenues decreased by 57.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Merchant revenues decreased by 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to decreases in gross bookings from our merchant accommodation reservation services and merchant rental car reservation services due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Advertising and other revenues decreased by 67.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a decline in consumer demand for the travel and restaurant-related services offered by KAYAK and OpenTable. In addition, advertising and other revenue related to OpenTable has been further impacted by a program that waived fees payable by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service and subscription fees for many restaurants.Total revenues as a percentage of gross bookings was 19.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to timing of booking versus travel as revenue benefited from travel early in the year ended December 31, 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic, while gross bookings were negatively impacted by cancellations of bookings made in 2019. Our international businesses accounted for approximately $6.0 billion of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $13.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total revenues attributable to our international businesses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 55.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (decreased on a constant-currency basis by approximately 55%). Total revenues attributable to our U.S. businesses decreased 49.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.Operating Expenses Marketing expenses Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Marketing expenses$2,179 $4,967 (56.1)%% of Total revenues32.1 %33.0 % We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. Marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) offline and online brand marketing; and (5) other performance-based marketing and incentives. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our marketing expense declined significantly due to reduced travel demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We adjust our marketing spend based on our growth and profitability objectives, as well as the travel demand and expected ROIs in our marketing channels. Marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to actions we took to reduce our brand and performance marketing spend in response to the reduced travel demand.Sales and Other Expenses Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Sales and other expenses$755 $955 (20.8)%% of Total revenues11.1 %6.3 % Sales and other expenses consist primarily of: (1) credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers; (3) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (4) customer relations costs; and (5) customer chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales and other expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to decreases in expenses related to 56transactions processed on a merchant basis, partially offset by an increase in expected credit loss expenses of $161 million primarily resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Personnel$1,944 $2,248 (13.5)%% of Total revenues28.6 %14.9 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes, and employee health and other benefits. Personnel expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to $126 million of government aid benefit and approximately $110 million of savings resulting from restructuring activities at all our brands, as well as a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and lower bonus accruals, both of which were impacted by reduced financial performance and reduced headcount as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stock-based compensation expense was $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $308 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Headcount decreased 23% year-over-year to approximately 20,300 as of December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 26,400 as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to restructuring actions and attrition, as well as a general temporary company-wide hiring freeze. Given the timing of our restructuring actions, the average quarter-end headcount for 2020 only decreased 6% compared to 2019.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019General and administrative$581 $797 (27.1)%% of Total revenues8.6 %5.3 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (3) indirect taxes such as travel transaction taxes and digital services taxes; and (4) personnel-related expenses such as travel, relocation, recruiting and training expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to lower personnel-related expenses associated with a general company-wide freeze on non-essential travel and entertainment and employee hiring due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower office and occupancy expenses due to employees working remotely, and lower professional service fees. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Information technology$299 $285 4.9 %% of Total revenues4.4 %1.9 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) outsourced data center and cloud computing costs; (3) payments to contractors; and (4) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services. Information technology expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to increased software license fees related to cyber security and data privacy software, as well as increased outsourced data center costs.57Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Depreciation and amortization$458 $469 (2.4)%% of Total revenues6.7 %3.1 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) depreciation of computer equipment; (3) amortization of internally-developed and purchased software; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of decreased depreciation of computer equipment, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of leasehold improvements, partially offset by increased internally-developed software amortization expenses.Restructuring and other exit costs Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Restructuring and other exit costs$149 $— N/A% of Total revenues2.2 %N/A During the year ended December 31, 2020, we took restructuring actions at all our brands in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and as a result incurred restructuring charges amounting to $149 million. These restructuring charges are primarily related to employee severance and benefits (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Impairment of Goodwill Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Impairment of Goodwill$1,062 $— N/A% of Total revenues15.6 %N/A During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges to goodwill related to OpenTable and KAYAK, which are not tax-deductible, of $1.1 billion (see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).Interest expense Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Interest expense(356)(266)33.8 % Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to interest expense attributable to our Senior Notes and Convertible Senior Notes issued in April 2020.58Other income (expense), net Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Other income (expense), net1,554 879 76.8 %The following table sets forth the breakdown of ""Other income (expense), net"" for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:Year Ended December 31,(in millions)20202019Interest and dividend income$54 $152 Net gains on marketable equity securities1,811 745 Impairment of investment(100)— Foreign currency transaction losses(207)(31)Other (4)13 Other income (expense), net$1,554 $879 Interest and dividend income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower average invested balances and lower yields as well as increased usage of investments classified as cash equivalents.Net gains on marketable equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 primarily related to the unrealized gains on our equity investment in Meituan (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Impairment of investment for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to our investment in Didi Chuxing (see Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information).Foreign currency transaction losses include losses of $200 million and gains of $7 million related to the portion of our Euro-denominated debt that was not designated as a net investment hedge and foreign currency losses on derivative contracts of $31 million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20202019Income tax expense$508 $1,093 (53.5)%% of Earnings before income taxes89.5 %18.3 % Our 2020 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges related to OpenTable and KAYAK, U.S. federal tax associated with our 2020 international earnings, and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax (discussed below). Our 2019 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax, partially offset by the effect of higher international tax rates and U.S. federal and state tax associated with our 2019 international earnings, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act, as well as certain non-deductible expenses. Our effective tax rate was higher for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges related to OpenTable and KAYAK, an increase in U.S. federal tax associated with our 2020 international earnings, and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits. 59According to Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 7% (""Innovation Box Tax"") rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on our effective tax rates for those periods. In 2020, the Dutch government approved an increase in the Innovation Box Tax rate from 7% to 9%, effective January 2021. While we expect Booking.com to continue to qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatment with respect to a portion of its earnings for the foreseeable future, the loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit, whether due to a change in tax law or a determination by the Dutch government that Booking.com's activities are not innovative or for any other reason, could substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may not be able to maintain our 'Innovation Box Tax' benefit.""Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018 For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020.60Liquidity and Capital Resources The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions and government orders have resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and an unprecedented decline in travel and restaurant activities and consumer demand for related services. Our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services.The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. These include, but are not limited to, the severity, extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any new variants of COVID-19 and any resurgences of the pandemic, and its impact on the travel and restaurant industries and consumer spending more broadly. Even if economic and operating conditions for our business improve, we cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industries as a whole. If the travel and restaurant industries are fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are detrimental to our operating model, our business may continue to be adversely affected even as the broader global economy recovers.Our continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our ability to meet debt covenant requirements, our operating performance and our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or financing sources were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels or our industry, our access to capital and the cost of any financing would be negatively impacted. There is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants than those we are currently subject to, which could restrict our business operations. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Our liquidity, credit ratings and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.""At December 31, 2020, we had $14.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $6.0 billion is held by our international subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents and long-term investments held by our international subsidiaries are denominated primarily in Hong Kong Dollars, U.S. Dollars and Euros. Cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments are principally comprised of money market funds, time deposits and certificates of deposit, convertible debt securities of Trip.com Group, Meituan equity securities and our investments in private companies (see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In May 2020, our May 2015 investment of $250 million in Trip.com Group's convertible senior notes was repaid upon maturity. We have the option to redeem our December 2015 investment of $500 million in Trip.com Group's convertible senior notes in December 2021, which we expect to exercise (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).During the year ended December 31, 2020, we realized $2.2 billion in cash from sales and maturities of our investments in government and corporate debt securities. In addition, we sold our entire investment in Trip.com Group ADSs, with a cost basis of $655 million for $525 million.At December 31, 2020, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $1.0 billion as a result of the Tax Act, which included $923 million reported as ""Long-term U.S. transition tax liability"" and $90 million included in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This liability will be paid over the next six years. In accordance with the Tax Act, generally, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by us. In August 2019, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $80 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $100 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The proceeds of loans made under the facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayments. At December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding and $4 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant, compliance with which is a condition to our ability to borrow thereunder. In April 2020, we amended the revolving credit facility, pursuant to which the maximum leverage ratio covenant was suspended through and including the three months ending March 31, 2021, and was replaced with a $4.5 billion minimum liquidity covenant based on unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and unused capacity under the revolving credit facility. In October 2020, we further amended the revolving credit facility to extend the suspension of the maximum leverage ratio covenant and the related replacement with the minimum liquidity covenant through and including the three months ending March 31, 2022 and increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio from and including the three months ending June 30, 2022 through and including the three months ending March 31, 2023. We agreed not to declare or make any cash distribution and not to repurchase any of our shares (with certain exceptions including in connection with tax withholding 61related to shares issued to employees) unless (i) prior to the delivery of financial statements for the three months ending June 30, 2022, we have at least $6.0 billion of liquidity on a pro forma basis, based on unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and unused capacity under this revolving credit facility and (ii) after the delivery of financial statements for the three months ending June 30, 2022, we are in compliance on a pro forma basis with the maximum leverage ratio covenant then in effect. Such restriction ends upon delivery of financial statements required for the three months ending June 30, 2023, or we have the ability to terminate this restriction earlier if we demonstrate compliance with the original maximum leverage ratio covenant in the revolving credit facility. Beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2022, the minimum liquidity covenant will cease to apply and the maximum leverage ratio covenant, as increased, will again be in effect. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet either the minimum liquidity covenant or the maximum leverage ratio covenant, as applicable, at any particular time, and our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility depends on compliance with the applicable covenant. Further, the lenders have the right to require repayment of any amounts borrowed under the facility if we are not in compliance with the applicable covenant (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In June 2020, in connection with the maturity of our Convertible Senior Notes due June 2020, we paid $1.0 billion to satisfy the aggregate principal amount due and paid an additional $245 million in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. In addition, the holders of our Convertible Senior Notes due September 2021 will have the right to convert all or any portion of the Notes beginning on June 15, 2021, regardless of our stock price (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). In April 2020, we issued Senior Notes due April 13, 2025 with an interest rate of 4.10% for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, Senior Notes due April 13, 2027 with an interest rate of 4.50% for an aggregate principal amount of $750 million and Senior Notes due April 13, 2030 with an interest rate of 4.625% for an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. In addition, in April 2020, we issued $863 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2025 with an interest rate of 0.75%. The proceeds from the issuance of these Senior Notes and Convertible Senior Notes can be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of debt, including the repayment, at maturity or upon conversion prior thereto, of our outstanding Convertible Senior Notes (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were $14.0 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively, of payment obligations related to the aggregate principal of our outstanding senior notes outstanding and cumulative interest to maturity. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the Company's debt including principal, interest rates and maturity dates.During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 684,827 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $1.3 billion. At December 31, 2020, we had a remaining aggregate amount of $10.4 billion authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock. We have not repurchased any shares since March 2020 under this stock repurchase authorization and do not intend to initiate any repurchases under this authorization until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the impact of the October 2020 credit facility amendment on our ability to repurchase shares. In September 2016, we signed a turnkey agreement to construct an office building for Booking.com’s future headquarters in the Netherlands for 270 million Euros ($331 million). Upon signing this agreement, we paid 43 million Euros ($48 million) for the acquired land-use rights. In addition, since signing the turnkey agreement we have made several progress payments principally related to the construction of the building. At December 31, 2020, we had a remaining obligation of 56 million Euros ($68 million) related to the turnkey agreement. This remaining obligation will be paid through 2022, when we anticipate construction will be complete. In addition to the turnkey agreement, we have a remaining obligation at December 31, 2020 to pay 70 million Euros ($86 million) over the remaining initial term of the acquired land lease, which expires in 2065. At December 31, 2020, we had 29 million Euros ($35 million) of outstanding commitments to vendors to fit out and furnish the office space. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our commitments and contingencies.We have taken and are taking actions to improve our liquidity including, but not limited to, raising additional capital through the issuance of Senior Notes and Convertible Senior Notes as disclosed above, reducing capital expenditures and operating expenses by significantly reducing marketing spend worldwide and working to eliminate non-essential operating costs, monitoring the financial health of our partners, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing a general temporary company-wide hiring freeze for much of 2020 and undertaking certain personnel actions such as furloughs and workforce reductions. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plans, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to compete or our future growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. 62Cash Flow AnalysisNet cash provided by operating activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our businesses and financial results, partially offset by the impact of the payment of $403 million in 2019 to French tax authorities to preserve our right to contest certain tax assessments in court (see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $85 million, resulting from net income of $59 million and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.0 billion, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $1.0 billion. Non-cash items were principally associated with net gains on marketable equity securities, impairment of goodwill, depreciation and amortization, provision for expected credit losses and chargebacks, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, deferred income tax expense and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses on Euro-denominated debt. For the year ended December 31, 2020, prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $161 million, primarily due to a refund for overpayment from a vendor and lower prepayment to third-party payment processors due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, accounts receivable decreased by $891 million and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities decreased by $2.3 billion primarily due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $4.9 billion, resulting from net income of $4.9 billion and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $541 million, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $541 million. Non-cash items were principally associated with net gains on marketable equity securities, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, operating lease amortization and the provision for expected credit losses and chargebacks. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting the increase in business volumes and growth in Booking.com's merchant transactions, were primarily related to a $480 million increase in deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, offset by a $323 million increase in accounts receivable and $263 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The net change in long-term assets and liabilities of $435 million was primarily due to the increase in other long-term assets related to the payment of $403 million to French tax authorities to preserve our right to contest the assessments in court (see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.6 billion, principally resulting from the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $3.0 billion, net of purchases of $74 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.1 billion, principally resulting from the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $8.1 billion, net of purchases of $0.7 billion. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment was $286 million and $368 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes payments of $52 million and $51 million, respectively, related to the turnkey agreement for constructing Booking.com's future headquarters. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.5 billion, almost entirely resulting from the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.1 billion, partially offset by payments for the repurchase of common stock of $1.3 billion and payments for the conversion of convertible notes of $1.2 billion. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $8.2 billion, almost entirely resulting from payments for the repurchase of common stock. For a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and our cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020.ContingenciesFrench tax authorities conducted audits of Booking.com for the years 2003 through 2012 and years 2013 through 2015 and currently are conducting an audit for the years 2016 through 2018. In December 2015, the French tax authorities issued Booking.com assessments for unpaid income and value added taxes (""VAT"") related to tax years 2006 through 2012 for approximately 356 million Euros ($403 million), the majority of which represents penalties and interest. The assessments assert that Booking.com had a permanent establishment in France. In December 2019, the French tax authorities issued an additional assessment of 70 million Euros ($86 million), including interest and penalties, for the 2013 year asserting that Booking.com had taxable income attributable to a permanent establishment in France. The French tax authorities also have issued assessments totaling 39 million Euros ($48 million), including interest and penalties, for certain tax years between 2011 63and 2015 on Booking.com's French subsidiary asserting that the subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the services it rendered to Booking.com in the Netherlands. As a result of a formal demand from the French tax authorities for payment of the amounts assessed against Booking.com for the years 2006 through 2012, in January 2019, we paid the assessments of approximately 356 million Euros ($403 million) in order to preserve our right to contest those assessments in court. The payment, which is included in ""Other assets, net"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, does not constitute an admission that we owe the taxes and will be refunded (with interest) to us to the extent we prevail. In December 2019 and October 2020, we initiated court proceedings with respect to certain of the assessments. Although we believe that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with French tax law, and we are contesting the assessments, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, we contacted the French tax authorities regarding the potential to achieve resolution of the matter through a settlement. After assessing several potential outcomes and potential settlement amounts and terms, an unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of 50 million Euros ($61 million) has been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, of which the majority has been included as a partial reduction to the tax payment recorded in ""Other Assets, net"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020. In December 2020, the French Administrative Court (Conseil d’Etat) delivered a decision in the ""ValueClick"" case that could have an impact on the outcome in our case. After considering the potential impact of the new decision on the potential outcomes for the Booking.com assessments, we currently estimate that the reasonably possible loss related to VAT is approximately 20 million Euros ($24 million). Additional assessments could result when the French tax authorities complete the outstanding audits. For additional information related to the French tax assessments, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""Beginning in 2014, Booking.com received several letters from the Netherlands Pension Fund for the Travel Industry (Reiswerk) (“BPF”) claiming that Booking.com is required to participate in the mandatory pension scheme of the BPF with retroactive effect to 1999, which has a higher contribution rate than the pension scheme in which Booking.com is currently participating. BPF instituted legal proceedings against Booking.com and in 2016 the District Court of Amsterdam rejected all of BPF’s claims. BPF appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal, and, in May 2019, the Court of Appeal also rejected all of BPF’s claims, in each case by ruling that Booking.com does not meet the definition of a travel intermediary for purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. BPF has appealed to the Netherlands Supreme Court. In October 2020, the Dutch Advocate General issued an opinion to the Supreme Court stating that the Dutch Advocate General believes the decision of the Court of Appeal to be incorrect based on her interpretation of the pension scheme requirements. We have submitted to the Supreme Court a response to the Advocate General's opinion. While we continue to believe that Booking.com is in compliance with its pension obligations and that the Dutch Supreme Court should uphold the ruling of the Court of Appeal, based on the significant influence the Dutch Advocate General’s opinion typically has on the Supreme Court, we have reevaluated the probability of a loss and believe it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to this matter. We expect the Dutch Supreme Court to rule in the first quarter of 2021. In the event the Supreme Court overturns the decision of the Court of Appeal and remands the case to a lower court, we intend to pursue a number of defenses in any subsequent proceedings and may ultimately prevail in whole or in part. We are not able to reasonably estimate a loss or a range of loss because the litigation is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal questions yet to be determined. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, we have not recorded a liability in connection with a potential adverse outcome to this litigation. However, if Booking.com were to ultimately lose and all of BPF’s claims were to be accepted (including with retroactive effect to 1999), we estimate that as of December 31, 2020, the maximum loss, not including any potential interest or penalties, would be approximately $290 million. Such estimated potential loss increases as Booking.com continues not to contribute to the BPF and depends on Booking.com’s applicable employee compensation after December 31, 2020. For additional information related to the pension matter and our other contingent liabilities, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 64Contractual Obligations and Commercial CommitmentsThe following table represents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2020: By Period (in millions)TotalLess than1 Year1 to 3Years3 to 5 YearsMore than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations(1)$585 $168 $196 $85 $136 Building construction obligation(2)103 87 16 — — Purchase obligations (3)193 77 73 43 — Senior notes(4)13,991 1,323 3,225 4,049 5,394 U.S. transition tax liability1,013 90 212 453 258 Letters of credit and bank guarantees(5)138 110 6 2 20 Revolving credit facility and other(6)11 4 6 1 — Total(7) (8)$16,034 $1,859 $3,734 $4,633 $5,808 (1) Includes the land lease for Booking.com's future headquarters. See Notes 10 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.(2) Includes commitments to vendors to fit out and furnish the office space. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.(3) Represents significant noncancellable contractual obligations individually greater than $10 million. The obligations are primarily related to sponsorship and cloud hosting arrangements. Purchase obligations included here are those related to agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding, that specify all significant terms, including the quantities to be purchased, price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount of our senior notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 and cumulative interest to maturity of $1.8 billion. Convertible debt does not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or shares of common stock at our option. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.(5) Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees issued on behalf of the Company at December 31, 2020 are primarily related to payment guarantees to third-party payment processors (see Notes 12 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). (6) Includes commitment fees on undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility and fees on outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2020.(7) We reported ""Other long-term liabilities"" of $111 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020, the majority of which relates to unrecognized tax benefits of $57 million (see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). We have excluded these long-term liabilities from the contractual obligations table above as a variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for the liabilities; therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and, accordingly, we have classified the estimated liability as non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (8) In 2018, we entered into an agreement to sign a future lease related to approximately 222,000 square feet of office space in the city of Manchester in the United Kingdom for the future headquarters of Rentalcars.com. Our obligation to execute the lease is conditional upon the lessor completing certain activities, which are expected to be completed in 2021. If these activities are completed, the lease will commence for a term of approximately 13 years and we will have a lease obligation of approximately 65 million British Pounds Sterling ($88 million), excluding lease incentives. We will also make capital expenditures to fit out and furnish the office space. The obligation is not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.65Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have exposure to several types of market risk: changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices.We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign currency exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold our investments in government and corporate debt securities other than our investments in Trip.com Group convertible senior notes (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our investments in Trip.com Group convertible senior notes are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of Trip.com Group's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") than changes in interest rates. The estimated fair value of our Trip.com Group convertible senior notes will likely increase as the market price of Trip.com Group's ADSs increases and will likely decrease as the market price of Trip.com Group's ADSs falls. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was $12.2 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively. We estimate that the fair value of such debt was approximately $14.0 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The estimated fair value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at December 31, 2020 primarily relates to Senior Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes issued in April 2020. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at December 31, 2019 primarily relates to the conversion premium on the convertible senior notes. Excluding the effect on the fair value of our convertible senior notes, a hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of our other debt of approximately $544 million and $325 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our convertible senior notes are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of our shares than changes in interest rates. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will likely increase as the market price of our shares increases and will likely decrease as the market price of our shares falls. Our international business represents a substantial majority of our financial results. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our international businesses are translated from local currencies (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currencies. However, for the year ended December 31, 2020, movements in foreign currency exchange rates had little to no impact on our performance metrics and financial results. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have a significant investment that is denominated in Hong Kong Dollars and the related impact from the movements in foreign currency exchange rates is recognized in ""Other income (expense), net"" in the Consolidated Statements and Operations.We designate certain portions of the aggregate principal value of the Euro-denominated debt as a hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of one of our Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in ""Other income (expense), net"" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the amount of 66net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiary, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In periods prior to the second quarter of 2020, we also entered into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge translation risks from short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the Euro, British Pound Sterling and certain other currencies versus the U.S. Dollar. Since the first quarter of 2020, we have not entered into such derivative instruments as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results are highly uncertain. We will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instruments in the future. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in the fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) on the business of the investee and the estimated decline in the value of our investment, we recorded a significant impairment charge related to our investment in a private company during the three months ended March 31, 2020 (see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies, excluding certain investments classified as debt securities for accounting purposes, were $3.1 billion and $455 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020, and $1.8 billion and $501 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Our investments in private companies, excluding certain investments classified as debt securities for accounting purposes, are measured at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values of these investments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 would have resulted in a loss, before tax, of approximately $355 million and $230 million, respectively, being recognized in net income.",2023-12-30 18:43:55.227460
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2022,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in any forward-looking statements, which may be due to factors discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.OverviewOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We connect consumers who wish to make travel reservations with travel service providers around the world through our online platforms. Consumers can also use our meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. We also offer various other services to consumers and partners, such as travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services to restaurants. We offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. We continue to increase the collaboration, cooperation, and interdependency among our brands to provide consumers with the most comprehensive services. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Segment Reporting for information on our operating segments. The results of our business outside of the U.S. consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda, and Rentalcars.com in their entirety and the parts of the KAYAK and OpenTable businesses located outside of the U.S. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services, or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com (which is domiciled in the Netherlands) at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the U.S. is part of the results of our businesses outside of the U.S. In 2021, the revenues from our businesses outside of the U.S. (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com through facilitating accommodation reservations) represented approximately 87% of our consolidated revenues. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information. We derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from advertising services, restaurant reservations and restaurant management services, and various other services, such as travel-related insurance revenues.TrendsThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting implementation of travel restrictions by governments around the world resulted in a significant decline in travel activities and consumer demand for related services in 2020 in particular. Accommodation room nights, which include the impact of cancellations, declined rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic spread in the first quarter of 2020 and the beginning of the second quarter of 2020. Since the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and through 2021, accommodation room night declines versus the comparable period in 2019 have generally improved as government-imposed travel restrictions have eased, vaccines and other medical interventions have become more widespread, and consumer demand for travel has started to rebound. However, there have been periods of worsening trends due to spikes in COVID-19 cases and newly implemented travel restrictions, primarily related to new variants. 39We have observed an improvement in cancellation rates since the high in April 2020, though we have seen periods of elevated cancellation rates typically coinciding with significant increases in COVID-19 cases and newly imposed restrictions. The cancellation rate in 2021 improved meaningfully when compared to 2020 but remained a few percentage points higher than in 2019. In 2021, a higher share of our room nights were booked with flexible cancellation policies, as compared to 2019 and 2020, which could result in higher than normal cancellation rates in future quarters. Increases in cancellation rates can negatively impact our marketing efficiency and we may see increased customer service costs as we did early in the COVID-19 pandemic.In 2021, we saw an increase in the share of room nights booked for international travel (travelers booking a stay at a property located outside their own country) versus 2020, however, the share remained well below 2019 levels. Since the second quarter of 2020, the share of room nights booked for international travel has been substantially lower than 2019 levels, as government-imposed travel restrictions have generally limited international travel more than domestic travel (travelers booking a stay within their own country). We have seen an increase in the share of room nights booked on a mobile device and an increased share of mobile app bookings in 2021 as compared to 2019 and 2020. We also see favorable repeat direct booking behavior from consumers in our apps and they allow us more opportunities to engage directly with consumers. The revenue earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay, have lower accommodation average daily rates (""ADRs""), and are not made as far in advance. Our global ADRs increased in 2021 as compared to 2019, due in part to changes in the geographical mix of our business driven primarily by stronger room night performance in North America, which is a high ADR region, and weaker room night performance in Asia, which is a low ADR region. In addition, our global ADRs in 2021 benefited from higher ADRs in Europe and North America as compared to 2019, driven by rate increases across many destination types with notable strength in beach-oriented leisure destinations. Global ADRs in 2020 were meaningfully below 2019 ADRs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a trend of declining constant-currency accommodation ADRs partially driven by the negative impact of the changing geographical mix of our business (e.g., lower ADR regions like Asia were generally growing faster than higher ADR regions like Western Europe and North America) as well as pricing pressures within local markets from time to time. Those declining ADR trends we experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in and could in the future result in our gross bookings growing less than our room nights. As the travel market continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect travel industry ADRs generally to increase from the pandemic lows in 2020, and as a result our ADRs to increase similarly, however, the pace of recovery and improvement in industry ADRs remains highly uncertain.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced many years of growth in our accommodation reservation services. We believe this growth was the result of, among other things, the broader shift of travel purchases from offline to online, the widespread adoption of mobile devices, and the growth of travel overall. We also believe this growth was the result of the continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to increase the number and the variety of accommodations we offer consumers, increase and improve content, build distribution, and improve the consumer experience on our online platforms, as well as to consistently and effectively market our brands through performance and brand marketing efforts. As the travel market recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see higher than pre-COVID-19 pandemic growth rates until we return to the level of travel market demand that we observed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, after which we expect prior trends to generally resume. However, we believe that we have an opportunity to grow the size of our business beyond pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels in both mature and less mature markets. We are constantly innovating to grow our business by, among other things, providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms to ensure that we are meeting the needs of online consumers while aiming to exceed 40their expectations. As part of these ongoing efforts, we have a long-term strategy to build a more integrated offering of multiple elements of travel connected by a payment platform, which we refer to as the ""Connected Trip,"" and we expect these efforts to increase room night growth and revenue growth over time. We may see a negative impact on our operating margins in the near term as we incur the expenses associated with Connected Trip-related investments. Further, to the extent our non-accommodation services (e.g., airline ticket reservation services) have lower margins and grow faster than our accommodation services, whether as part of the Connected Trip or otherwise, our operating margins may be negatively affected. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes.""As part of our strategy to provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com, and enable our long-term Connected Trip strategy, Booking.com is increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis, where it facilitates payments from travelers for the services provided. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer secure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that adding these types of service offerings will benefit consumers and travel service providers, as well as our gross bookings, room night, and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional expenses for personnel, payment processing, chargebacks (including those related to fraud), and other expenses related to these transactions, which are recorded in ""Personnel"" and ""Sales and other expenses"" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as associated incremental revenues (e.g., credit card rebates), which are recorded in ""Merchant revenues."" To the extent more of our business is generated on a merchant basis, we incur a greater level of these merchant-related expenses, which negatively impacts our operating margins despite increases in associated incremental revenues.We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Our marketing expenses, which are comprised of performance marketing and brand marketing expenses, declined significantly as a result of the negative impact on travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, our marketing expense increased significantly versus 2020 as a result of the improving demand environment and our own efforts to invest in marketing, but remained below 2019 levels. Our performance marketing expense, which represents a substantial majority of our marketing expense, is primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services, and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our platforms. Our brand marketing expense is primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing television advertising, online video advertising (for example, on YouTube and Facebook), online display advertising, and other brand marketing. Total marketing expenses were $3.8 billion, $2.2 billion, and $5.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.Marketing efficiency, expressed as marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings, and performance marketing returns on investment (""ROIs"") are impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and are in some cases outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers, and the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns. Marketing efficiency can also be impacted by the extent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings. In 2021, the share of room nights booked by consumers coming directly to our platforms increased as compared to 2020 and 2019, which benefits marketing efficiency. In recent years, we observed periods of stable or increasing ROIs. In 2021, ROIs were about in line with 2019 levels and increased versus 2020 when ROIs were negatively impacted by a significant increase in cancellation rates early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect volatility in our ROIs as the pandemic continues to affect travel, and that ROIs could be negatively impacted in the future by increased levels of competition and other factors. When evaluating our performance marketing spend, we typically consider several factors for each channel, such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incremental traffic we receive, and the anticipated repeat rate from a particular platform. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our platforms and grow our business."" and ""Our business could be negatively affected by changes in online search and meta-search algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.""Historically, our growth has primarily been generated by the worldwide accommodation reservation business of our most significant brand, Booking.com, due in part to the availability of a large number of properties through Booking.com. Booking.com included approximately 2.4 million properties on its website at December 31, 2021, consisting of over 400,000 hotels, motels, and resorts, and over 1.9 million homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay, all of which were about in line with the number of properties on its website at December 31, 2020. Booking.com categorizes properties listed on its website as either (a) hotels, motels, and resorts, which groups together more traditional accommodation types (including hostels and inns), or (b) homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay, also referred to as alternative accommodations, which encompasses all other types of accommodations, including bed and breakfasts, villas, apart-hotels, and beyond. We intend to 41continue to improve the accommodation choices available for reservation on our platforms but the number of accommodations on our platforms may vary in part as a result of removing or adding accommodations from time to time.The share of Booking.com’s room nights booked for alternative accommodation properties in 2021 was about 29%, which was about the same as the share of room nights in 2019 and down slightly from 2020. Prior to the pandemic, we observed an overall longer-term trend of an increasing share of room nights booked for alternative accommodation properties as consumer demand for these types of properties has grown, and as we have increased the number and variety of alternative accommodation properties available to consumers on Booking.com. We may experience lower profit margins due to certain additional costs, such as increased customer service costs, related to offering alternative accommodations on our platforms. As our alternative accommodation business has grown, these different characteristics have negatively impacted our profit margins and this trend may continue. Although we believe that providing an extensive collection of properties, excellent customer service, and an intuitive, easy-to-use consumer experience are important factors influencing a consumer's decision to make a reservation, for many consumers, particularly in certain markets, the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether a consumer will book a reservation. Discounting and couponing coupled with a high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in Asian markets. In some cases, our competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction, or offer travel services at a loss, in order to gain market share. As a result, it is increasingly important to offer travel services, such as accommodation reservations, at a competitive price, whether through discounts, coupons, closed-user group rates or loyalty programs, increased flexibility in cancellation policies, or otherwise. These initiatives have resulted and in the future may result in lower ADRs and lower revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. Many taxing authorities are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues and have targeted large multinational technology companies in these efforts. As a result, many countries and some U.S. states have implemented or are considering the adoption of a digital services tax or similar tax that imposes a tax on revenue earned from digital advertisements or the use of online platforms, even when there is no physical presence in the jurisdiction. Currently, rates for this tax range from 1.5% to 10% of revenue deemed generated in the jurisdiction. The digital services taxes currently in effect, which we record in ""General and administrative"" expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, have negatively impacted our results of operations. While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been working on multinational tax changes that could require all member parties to remove all digital services taxes, the timing and details are not yet known. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""Many national governments have conducted or are conducting investigations into competitive practices within the online travel industry, and we may be involved or affected by such investigations and their results. Some countries have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practices within the online travel industry. For example, France, Italy, Belgium, and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety. Also, a number of governments are investigating or conducting information-gathering exercises with respect to compliance by online travel companies (""OTCs"") with consumer protection laws, including practices related to the display of search results and search ranking algorithms, claims regarding discounts, disclosure of charges and availability, and similar messaging. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be ""gatekeepers."" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not known what the laws will look like in their final forms. If regulators were to determine that we are a gatekeeper under the proposed legislation, we could be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed. For more information on these matters and their potential effects on our business, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Our business is subject to various competition, consumer protection, and online commerce laws, rules, and regulations around the world, and as the size of our business grows, scrutiny of our business by legislators and regulators in these areas may intensify."" In general, increased regulatory focus on online businesses, including online travel businesses like ours, could result in increased compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our businesses outside of the U.S. represent a substantial majority of our financial results, but because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our businesses outside of the U.S. are translated from local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. As a result, both the absolute amounts of and percentage changes in our foreign-currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate changes. For example, total revenues from our businesses outside of the U.S. increased by 58% in 2021 as compared to 2020, but without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 57%. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. We 42designate certain portions of the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in ""Other income (expense), net"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the amount of net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiaries, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.""We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instruments in the future. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our derivative contracts.OutlookIn December 2021, the spread of the Omicron variant and renewed travel restrictions in certain markets contributed to a 35% decline in room nights relative to December 2019. In January 2022, we saw room nights decline about 22% relative to January 2019, and in the first half of February 2022 room nights were about in line with the first half of February 2019, in each case primarily driven by improving room night trends in Europe. Given these rapid changes, particularly during the last six weeks, we cannot accurately predict the number of room nights that will be booked in the first quarter of 2022. Following from the above, for the first quarter of 2022 we currently expect: •the change in gross bookings relative to the first quarter of 2019 will be several percentage points better than the change in room nights for the same period primarily due to an increase in accommodation ADRs; •revenues as a percentage of gross bookings will be lower than it was in the first quarter of 2019; and•we will have an operating profit in the first quarter of 2022.Seasonality and Other Timing FactorsPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our gross bookings were generally similar in the first three quarters of the year and higher than in the fourth quarter. We generally recognize our marketing activities as the expense is incurred, which is typically in the quarter when the gross bookings for the associated reservations are recognized. However, we would generally recognize revenue from these bookings when the travel begins (at ""check-in""), and accommodation check-ins in Europe and North America are generally highest in the third quarter during those regions’ peak summer travel season and lowest in the first quarter. As a result of this timing difference between when we record marketing expense and when we generally recognize associated revenue, we typically experience our highest levels of profitability in the third quarter and our lowest level of profitability in the first quarter. In addition to the typical seasonality effects on our business, our quarterly results and quarterly year-over-year growth rates can be impacted by:•The length of the booking window (the average time between the booking of a travel reservation and when the travel begins), which impacts the relationship between our gross bookings (recognized at the time of booking) and our revenues (recognized at the time of check-in);•The level of acceleration or deceleration in the gross bookings growth rate. For example, our operating margins are typically negatively impacted in the near term from gross bookings and related variable marketing expense growth acceleration, as revenue growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term. Any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent periods as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters. Conversely, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit; and •The date on which certain holidays (e.g., Easter and Ramadan) fall.The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the booking window and seasonality of our business in 2020 and 2021. For example, in 2021 we saw a contraction of the booking window as an increased percentage of bookings were made for travel that was to occur close to the time of booking. It is difficult to accurately predict travel patterns given the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may not experience typical seasonality effects on our business throughout the duration of the pandemic, and potentially for some time thereafter. As the travel market recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see periods of 43gross bookings growth rate acceleration, which will likely result in periods where our operating margins are negatively impacted due to the timing difference of when marketing expense is recorded and when revenue is recognized. Other FactorsWe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide, and, over time, to offer other travel and travel-related services. Factors beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks, extreme weather or natural disasters, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as COVID-19, wars and regional hostilities, travel-related accidents, or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel, can disrupt travel, limit the ability or willingness of travelers to visit certain locations, or otherwise result in declines in travel demand, negatively affecting our business and results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""The COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely affected, and may further adversely impact, our business and financial performance."" and ""Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance.""The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. While we have seen signs of a recovery in travel demand in most parts of the world, we continue to expect that our business will be adversely impacted by surges of COVID-19 case counts, including those driven by variants of COVID-19, as well as any government-imposed travel restrictions in reaction to COVID-19 outbreaks, which could remain a risk for an extended period of time. Over the long term, we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology, and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. In recent years, we have experienced pressure on operating margins as we invested in initiatives to drive future growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, including exploring strategic alternatives such as acquisitions.The competition for technology talent in our industry has intensified, including among established technology companies, startups, and companies transitioning to digital. The competition for talent is exacerbated by an increased willingness of certain companies to offer flexible and remote working policies, which expands the pool of candidates from which our competitors may attract talent. This could continue in the future due to an actual or perceived slower pace of recovery of the travel industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic than other industries and other factors beyond our control. As a result of the highly competitive labor market, our personnel expenses to attract and retain key talent are increasing, which may adversely affect our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees or attract, retain, and motivate well-qualified employees, our business would be harmed.""Critical Accounting EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Matters that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:Valuation of Goodwill and other Long-lived AssetsThe application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair value are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable. When we deem appropriate, we utilize assistance from third-party valuation firms. The consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amounts allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.44A substantial portion of our intangible assets and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable, KAYAK, and Getaroom. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.We review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment indicators were identified for our long-lived assets. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2021.2020 Interim Goodwill Impairment TestDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.The estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples).The income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches). 2020 Annual Goodwill Impairment TestAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services.The estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples).The income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we expected a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within five years from that date, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations. An increase or decrease of one 45percentage point to the profitability growth rates used in the cash flow projections would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately $100 million to the estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK as of September 30, 2020. The discount rate is determined based on the reporting unit’s estimated weighted-average cost of capital and adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in its cash flows, which requires significant judgments. The discount rate used for the annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2020 was higher than the discount rate used for the interim goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020. If the discount rate used in the income approach increases or decreases by 0.5%, the impact to the estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK, at September 30, 2020, would have ranged from a decrease of approximately $65 million to an increase of approximately $70 million.The estimation of fair values of our reporting units reflect numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including key assumptions regarding each reporting unit’s expected growth rates and operating margin, expected length and severity of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery and the competitive environment, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates and market comparables. It requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than the judgments and estimates used to estimate fair value. Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units, particularly the assumptions related to the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery, which may result in a need to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Investments in Private CompaniesSee Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the investments in private companies. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on fair value measurements, including the three levels of inputs to measure fair value. When inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (observable market data), is available at the measurement date and is not significantly adjusted using unobservable inputs, the observable inputs would be classified as Level 2 inputs. When little or no market data is available, the fair value of these investments are measured using unobservable inputs (""Level 3 inputs""). As of December 31, 2020, our investments measured using Level 3 inputs primarily consisted of preferred stock investments in privately-held companies that were classified as either debt securities or equity securities without readily determinable fair values. Fair values of privately held securities are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies, including both market and income approaches. We have used valuation techniques appropriate for the type of investment and the information available about the investee as of the valuation date to determine fair value. Recent financing transactions in the investee, such as new investments in preferred stock, are generally considered the best indication of the enterprise value and therefore used as a basis to estimate fair value. However, based on a number of factors, such as the proximity in timing to the valuation date or the volume or other terms of these financing transactions, we may also use other valuation techniques to supplement this data, including the income approach. In addition, an option-pricing model (""OPM"") is utilized to allocate value to the various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model includes assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.Our investment in preferred shares of Grab Holdings Inc., which was classified as debt securities for accounting purposes at December 31, 2020, had an aggregate estimated fair value of $200 million at December 31, 2020. We measured this investment using Level 3 inputs and management's estimates that incorporated the current market participant expectations of future cash flows considered alongside recent financing transactions of the investee and other relevant information. In December 2021, pursuant to a business combination transaction involving Grab Holdings Inc., Grab Holdings Limited (“Grab”) and Altimeter Growth Corp. (the ""Grab Transaction""), the preferred shares were converted to Class A ordinary shares of Grab and such ordinary shares began publicly trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. As a result, the Company's investment was classified as equity securities with readily determinable fair values (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 31, 2021, the investment had a fair value of $301 million.For our investment in the equity securities of DiDi Global Inc. (""DiDi""), considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we performed an impairment analysis as of March 31, 2020 that resulted in an adjusted carrying value of $400 million at each of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. As a result of DiDi's initial public offering in June 2021, we reclassified our DiDi investment as equity securities with readily determinable fair values. At December 31, 2021, the investment had a fair value of $195 million.We had $51 million invested in Yanolja Co., Ltd. (""Yanolja"") at December 31, 2021 and 2020. In July 2021, Yanolja announced a new round of funding into the company. The new round of funding and certain other transactions in the equity securities of Yanolja were completed in October 2021. As a result of these observable transactions, we recorded an unrealized 46gain of $255 million in ""Other income (expense), net"" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 that resulted in an adjusted carrying value of $306 million at December 31, 2021 (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). The determination of the fair values of investments in private companies, where we are a minority shareholder and have access to limited information from the investee, reflects numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including key assumptions regarding the investee’s expected growth rates and operating margin, expected length and severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the investee and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates and market comparables. It requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates utilized in the fair value estimate. Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in our valuation, particularly the assumptions related to the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shape and timing of the recovery and the overall impact on the investee’s business, which may result in a need to recognize an additional impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Income Taxes We determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") enacted in December 2017 made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a one-time deemed repatriation tax imposed on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. We do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject to U.S. taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI""). We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences, and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. We have been audited in many jurisdictions and from time to time face challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and comply with applicable law, we regularly review our tax filing positions, especially in light of tax law or business practice changes, and we may change our positions or determine that previous positions should be amended, either of which could result in additional tax liabilities. The final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The evaluation of tax positions and recognition of income tax benefits require significant judgement and we consult with external tax and legal counsel as appropriate. We consider the technical merits of our tax positions along with the applicable tax statutes, related interpretations and precedents, and our expectation of the outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with tax authorities. We recognize liabilities when we believe that uncertain positions may not be fully sustained upon audit by the tax authorities, including any related appeals or litigation processes. Liabilities recognized for uncertain tax positions are based on a two-step approach for recognition and measurement. First, we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. Second, we measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties attributable to uncertain tax positions, if any, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The tax benefits ultimately realized by us may be different than what is recorded in the financial statements due to future events such as our settling the matter with the tax authorities and our success in sustaining our tax positions. See Notes 15 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.ContingenciesLoss contingencies (other than income tax-related contingencies disclosed above) arise from actual or possible claims and assessments and pending or threatened litigation that may be brought against us by individuals, governments, or other entities. Based on our assessment of loss contingencies at each balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial statements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose information about the contingency in the financial statements. We also disclose information in our financial statements about reasonably possible loss contingencies. 47The determination of whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated requires significant judgment and evaluation of all the underlying facts and circumstances, including judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants, regulatory authorities, and courts. Claims, assessments, and litigations involve significant uncertainties such as the complexity of the facts, the legal theories involved, the nature of the claims, the judgment of the courts, the applicable methodology for determining potential damages, and, in the case of class actions, whether a class action can be certified and the extent to which members of a class would or would not file a claim.On a quarterly basis, we update our analysis and estimates considering all available information, including the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, and advice of legal counsel. Changes in our assessment of whether a loss is probable, our estimate of the loss, or our determination of whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Changes in our assumptions regarding a particular matter or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal and other proceedings could also have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. For all loss contingencies, until a matter is finally resolved, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the liability accrued for the matter and such amounts could be material.See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Recent Accounting Pronouncements - See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details, which is incorporated into this Item 7 by reference thereto.48Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2021 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates. Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-related services. Specifically, reservations of room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked through our OTC brands by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through our OTC brands by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. Our non-OTC brands (KAYAK and OpenTable) have different business metrics from those of our OTC brands, so search queries through KAYAK and restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not contribute to our gross bookings.Room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Room nights591 355 66.4 %Rental car days47 31 53.5 %Airline tickets15 6 159.6 % Room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets reserved through our services increased significantly in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to the significant improvement in travel demand trends since the second quarter of 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The year-over-year increase in airline tickets in 2021 was also driven by strong execution and growth at Priceline, which operates primarily in the U.S. domestic travel market, a market that has recovered significantly faster than the global travel market from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to a lesser extent by strong growth at Booking.com, which had a relatively small amount of airline tickets booked in 2020. Gross bookings resulting from reservations of room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant categories for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Agency gross bookings$50,741 $24,475 107.3 %Merchant gross bookings25,845 10,920 136.7 %Total gross bookings$76,586 $35,395 116.4 % Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided, while merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we facilitate payments. Agency and merchant gross bookings increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to the significant improvement in travel demand trends since the second quarter of 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Merchant gross bookings increased more than agency gross bookings in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the expansion of merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com.Gross bookings increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to the increase in room nights, accommodation ADRs of approximately 25%, on a constant-currency basis, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Gross 49bookings resulting from reservations of rental car days and airline tickets also increased due to higher unit growth for both services. RevenuesOnline travel reservation servicesSubstantially all of our revenues are generated by providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases between travel service providers and travelers. Revenues from online travel reservation services are classified into two categories: •Agency. Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided. Agency revenues consist almost entirely of travel reservation commissions from our accommodation, rental car, and airline reservation services. Substantially all of our agency revenue is from Booking.com agency accommodation reservations. •Merchant. Merchant revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided, generally at the time of booking. Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where travelers book accommodation, rental car, and airline reservations. Merchant revenues include:◦travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our merchant reservation services; ◦credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees; and ◦ancillary fees, including travel-related insurance revenues. Advertising and other revenuesAdvertising and other revenues are derived primarily from:•revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on its platforms; and •revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) restaurant reservation services (fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service) and (b) subscription fees for restaurant management services. Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Agency revenues$6,663 $4,314 54.5 %Merchant revenues3,696 2,117 74.6 %Advertising and other revenues599 365 63.8 %Total revenues$10,958 $6,796 61.2 %Agency and merchant revenues increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to the significant improvement in travel demand trends since the second quarter of 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Merchant revenues in 2021 increased more year-over-year than agency revenues due to the expansion of merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com. Advertising and other revenues increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to the significant improvement in travel and restaurant demand trends since the second quarter of 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, since the second quarter of 2021 our advertising and other revenues benefited from fees payable by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service and subscription fees for restaurant management services, as the program that waived those fees ended in March 2021.50Total revenues as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.3% in 2021 compared to 19.2% in 2020. In 2021, revenues as a percentage of gross bookings was negatively impacted by the timing of booking versus travel as a lower amount of gross bookings made in 2020 were related to travel in 2021 than gross bookings made in 2021 related to expected travel in 2022, which is when we expect to recognize the associated revenue. In addition, in 2020, revenues as a percentage of gross bookings was positively impacted by timing of booking versus travel as revenue benefited from travel earlier in the year before the COVID-19 pandemic, while gross bookings were more negatively impacted by a significant increase in cancellations in March and April 2020. Our businesses outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately $9.5 billion of our total revenues in 2021, a 58% increase compared to 2020. Total revenues attributable to our U.S. businesses increased 83% in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues attributable to our U.S. businesses in 2021 increased more year-over-year than our businesses outside of the U.S. due mainly to growth at Priceline, which operates primarily in the U.S. domestic travel market, a market that has recovered significantly faster than the global travel market from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating Expenses Marketing expenses Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Marketing expenses$3,801 $2,179 74.5 %% of Total gross bookings5.0 %6.2 %% of Total revenues34.7 %32.1 % Marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of: •search engine keyword purchases;•referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; •affiliate programs; •offline and online brand marketing; and •other performance-based marketing and incentives. We adjust our marketing spend based on our growth and profitability objectives, as well as the travel demand and expected ROIs in our marketing channels. We rely on our marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. In 2021, our marketing expense, which is substantially variable in nature, increased significantly compared to 2020, due primarily to the improvement in travel demand trends since the second quarter of 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross bookings decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to year-over-year increases in performance marketing ROIs and favorable changes in the share of traffic by channel in 2021.Sales and Other Expenses Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Sales and other expenses$881 $755 16.5 %% of Total revenues8.0 %11.1 % Sales and other expenses consist primarily of: •credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; •fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations, and other services; •chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; •customer relations costs; and •provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers. 51In 2021, sales and other expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in merchant transaction costs of $215 million and an increase in outsourced call center costs of $100 million. Merchant transactions increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the significant improvement in travel demand trends since the second quarter of 2020 and the expansion of merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com. The increase in merchant transaction and outsourced call center costs were partially offset by a decrease in expected credit loss expenses of $176 million in 2021 as we substantially increased our provision for expected credit losses in the first quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Personnel Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Personnel$2,314 $1,944 19.0 %% of Total revenues21.1 %28.6 % Personnel expenses consist primarily of: •salaries; •stock-based compensation; •bonuses;•payroll taxes; and •employee health and other benefits. Personnel expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense increased 14% in 2021 compared to 2020 due to $136 million of expense in 2021 for the return of government assistance received through various government aid programs, a $126 million benefit from government grants and other assistance recognized in 2020, and a $124 million higher bonus expense accrual, partially offset by $127 million lower salary expenses. Certain governments passed legislation to help businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic through loans, wage subsidies, tax relief, or other financial aid. We participated in several of these programs, including the Netherlands' wage subsidy program and the United Kingdom's job retention scheme. In 2021, we voluntarily returned assistance received through various government aid programs and we recorded the $136 million in expense mentioned above to reflect the return of such assistance. In response to the reduction in our business volumes as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we took actions at all of our brands to reduce the size of our workforce to optimize efficiency and reduce costs, which resulted in annualized personnel cost savings relative to our personnel expense run rate at the end of the first quarter of 2020 of approximately $370 million. Headcount was flat year-over-year at 20,300 as of December 31, 2021, but given the timing of our restructuring actions in the second half of 2020, the average headcount for 2021 decreased about 20% compared to 2020. Stock-based compensation expense was $370 million in 2021 compared to $233 million in 2020. The increase in stock-based compensation expense in 2021 was impacted by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of $73 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of reduced financial performance driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the modification of certain awards during the first quarter of 2021. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020General and administrative$620 $581 6.6 %% of Total revenues5.7 %8.6 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: •occupancy and office expenses; 52•fees for outside professionals; •indirect taxes such as travel transaction taxes and digital services taxes; and •personnel-related expenses such as travel, relocation, recruiting, and training expenses. General and administrative expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher fees for professional services, as well as higher indirect taxes driven by the improvement in revenue. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by the comparison to a higher level of personnel-related expenses, such as travel and entertainment costs, and occupancy and office expenses in the first quarter of 2020, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.Information Technology Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Information technology$412 $299 37.6 %% of Total revenues3.8 %4.4 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: •software license and system maintenance fees; •outsourced data center and cloud computing costs; •payments to contractors; and •data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services. Information technology expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to increased payments to contractors and software license fees, some of which relate to cybersecurity and data privacy.Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Depreciation and amortization$421 $458 (7.9)%% of Total revenues3.8 %6.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: •amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; •amortization of internally-developed and purchased software; •depreciation of computer equipment; and •depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and office equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to decreased depreciation of computer equipment, partially offset by increased internally-developed software amortization expense.Restructuring and Other Exit Costs Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Restructuring and other exit costs$13 $149 (91.1)%% of Total revenues0.1 %2.2 % Restructuring and other exit costs principally relate to the restructuring charges as a result of restructuring actions taken in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Restructuring and other exit costs decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 as these restructuring activities substantially concluded as of December 31, 2020. These restructuring 53charges are primarily related to employee severance and other termination benefits at Booking.com (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Impairment of Goodwill Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Impairment of Goodwill$— $1,062 N/A% of Total revenuesN/A15.6 % During 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to OpenTable and KAYAK, which are not tax-deductible, of $1.1 billion (see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Estimates included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).Interest expense Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Interest expense$(334)$(356)(6.1)% Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the issuance of senior notes with lower interest rates in March 2021 and the redemption of senior notes with higher interest rates in April 2021, the maturity in June 2020 and September 2021 of our convertible senior notes, partially offset by higher interest expenses associated with our outstanding senior notes and convertible senior note issued in April 2020.Other income (expense), net Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Other income (expense), net$(697)$1,554 (144.8)%The following table sets forth the breakdown of ""Other income (expense), net"" for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:Year Ended December 31,(in millions)20212020Interest and dividend income $16 $54 Net (losses) gains on equity securities (569)1,813 Impairment of investment — (100)Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) 111 (207)Loss on early extinguishment of debt (242)— Other (13)(6)Other income (expense), net$(697)$1,554 Interest and dividend income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower yields as well as the change in the mix of investments with increased usage of investments classified as cash equivalents.Net losses on equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2021 are primarily related to the losses on our equity investments in Meituan and DiDi, partially offset by gains on our equity investments in Grab and Yanolja. Net gains on equity 54securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 are principally related to the gains on our equity investment in Meituan (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Impairment of investment for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to our investment in DiDi (see Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Critical Accounting Estimates included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information).Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) include gains of $135 million and losses of $200 million related to our Euro-denominated debt and accrued interest that were not designated as net investment hedges and foreign currency losses on derivative contracts of $30 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Loss on early extinguishment of debt is related to the redemption of our Senior Notes due April 2025 (the ""April 2025 Notes"") and our Senior Notes due April 2027 (the ""April 2027 Notes"") in April 2021 (see Note 12 to ourConsolidated Financial Statements).Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 include losses on reverse treasury lock agreementswhich were designated as cash flow hedges (see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, (in millions)Increase (Decrease) 20212020Income tax expense$300 $508 (41.0)%% of Earnings before income taxes20.5 %89.5 % Our 2021 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax (discussed below), partially offset by higher international tax rates and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits. Our 2020 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges related to OpenTable and KAYAK, U.S. federal tax associated with our international earnings, and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax. Our effective tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges related to OpenTable and KAYAK that were recorded in December 31, 2020, lower U.S. federal and state tax associated with our international earnings and lower unrecognized tax benefits. Under Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 9% (""Innovation Box Tax"") for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. Previously, the Innovation Box Tax rate was 7%. Effective January 1, 2022, the Netherlands corporate income tax rate increased from 25% to 25.8%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on our effective tax rates for these periods. While we expect Booking.com to continue to qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatment with respect to a portion of its earnings for the foreseeable future, the loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit could substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may not be able to maintain our 'Innovation Box Tax' benefit.""Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2020 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.55Liquidity and Capital Resources The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions and government restrictions resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and a significant decline in travel and restaurant activities and consumer demand for related services as compared to 2019 levels. Our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services.The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. These include, but are not limited to, the severity, extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any new variants of COVID-19 and any resurgences of the pandemic, and the availability and efficacy of vaccines and other medical interventions to prevent or alleviate COVID-19 and their impacts on the travel and restaurant industries and consumer spending more broadly. Even though we have seen some improvements in the economic and operating conditions for our business since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industries as a whole. Our continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our ability to meet debt covenant requirements, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or financing sources were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels or our industry, our access to capital and the cost of any financing would be negatively impacted. There is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants than those we are currently subject to, which could restrict our business operations. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Our liquidity, credit ratings, and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.""At December 31, 2021, we had $14.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $7.4 billion is held by our international subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and long-term investments held by our international subsidiaries are denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, Hong Kong Dollars, and Euros. Cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments are principally comprised of money market funds, time deposits and certificates of deposit, convertible debt securities of Trip.com Group, equity securities of Meituan, Grab, and DiDi, and our investments in private companies (see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In December 2021, we redeemed our December 2015 investment of $500 million in Trip.com Group's convertible senior notes (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).At December 31, 2021, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $912 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act""), which included $825 million reported as ""Long-term U.S. transition tax liability"" and $87 million included in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This liability will be paid over the next five years. In accordance with the Tax Act, generally, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by us. In August 2019, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $80 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $100 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The proceeds of loans made under the facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases, and debt repayments. At December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and $4 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant, compliance with which is a condition to our ability to borrow thereunder. In 2020, we amended the revolving credit facility to (i) suspend the maximum leverage ratio covenant through and including the three months ending March 31, 2022, which was replaced with a $4.5 billion minimum liquidity covenant based on unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and unused capacity under this revolving credit facility and (ii) increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio from and including the three months ending June 30, 2022 through and including the three months ending March 31, 2023. We agreed not to declare or make any cash distribution and not to repurchase any of our shares (with certain exceptions including in connection with tax withholding related to shares issued to employees) unless (i) prior to the delivery of financial statements for the three months ending June 30, 2022, we have at least $6.0 billion of liquidity on a pro forma basis, based on unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and unused capacity under this revolving credit facility and (ii) after the delivery of financial statements for the three months ending June 30, 2022, we are in compliance on a pro forma basis with the maximum leverage ratio covenant then in effect. Such restriction 56ends upon delivery of financial statements required for the three months ending June 30, 2023, or we have the ability to terminate this restriction earlier if we demonstrate compliance with the original maximum leverage ratio covenant in the revolving credit facility. Beginning with the three months ending June 30, 2022, the minimum liquidity covenant will cease to apply and the maximum leverage ratio covenant, as increased, will again be in effect. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet either the minimum liquidity covenant or the maximum leverage ratio covenant, as applicable, at any particular time, and our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility depends on compliance with the applicable covenant. Further, the lenders have the right to require repayment of any amounts borrowed under the facility if we are not in compliance with the applicable covenant (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).In September 2021, in connection with the maturity of our Convertible Senior Notes due September 2021, we paid $1.0 billion to satisfy the aggregate principal amount due and an additional $86 million conversion premium in excess of the principal amount.In March 2021, we issued Senior Notes due March 2025 with an interest rate of 0.1% for an aggregate principal amount of 950 million Euros and Senior Notes due March 2028 with an interest rate of 0.5% for an aggregate principal amount of 750 million Euros. The proceeds from the issuance of these Senior Notes issued in March 2021 were used to redeem the April 2025 Notes and the April 2027 Notes. In April 2021, we paid $2.0 billion to redeem the April 2025 Notes and the April 2027 Notes.At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding senior notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $11.1 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within the next twelve months. The senior notes had a cumulative interest to maturity of $1.2 billion, with $233 million payable within the next twelve months. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt arrangements, including principal amounts, interest rates, and maturity dates.During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 71,494 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $162 million to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations related to stock-based compensation. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a remaining aggregate amount of $10.4 billion authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock. We resumed repurchases in early 2022 under this authorization and, as of February 22, 2022, have repurchased approximately $500 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2022. We expect to complete repurchases under the remaining authorization within the next three years assuming the travel recovery continues and we are able to meet our minimum liquidity covenant under the revolving credit facility. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the impact of the 2020 credit facility amendment on our ability to repurchase shares.In November 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire global flight booking provider, Etraveli Group, for approximately 1.6 billion Euros ($1.9 billion). Completion of this acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. In December 2021, we paid $1.2 billion, net of cash acquired, to acquire Getaroom, a business-to-business distributor of hotel rooms.In September 2016, we signed a turnkey agreement to construct an office building for Booking.com’s future headquarters in the Netherlands for 270 million Euros ($307 million). Upon signing this agreement, we paid 43 million Euros ($48 million) for the acquired land-use rights. In addition, since signing the turnkey agreement we have made several progress payments principally related to the construction of the building. As of December 31, 2021, we had a remaining obligation of 15 million Euros ($17 million) related to the turnkey agreement, which will be paid through 2022, when we anticipate construction will be complete. In addition to the turnkey agreement, we have a remaining obligation at December 31, 2021 to pay 68 million Euros ($77 million) over the remaining initial term of the acquired land lease, which expires in 2065. We have made and will continue to make additional capital expenditures to fit out and furnish the office space. At December 31, 2021, we had 20 million Euros ($23 million) of outstanding commitments to vendors to fit out and furnish the office space. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our commitments and contingencies.At December 31, 2021, we had lease obligations of $561 million, with $155 million payable within the next twelve months. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our obligation related to operating leases.At December 31, 2021, we had, in the aggregate, $154 million of non-cancellable purchase obligations individually greater than $10 million payable over the next five years, of which $41 million are payable within the next twelve months. The purchase obligations are primarily related to sponsorship and cloud hosting arrangements. The purchase obligations disclosed 57here are those related to agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding, that specify all significant terms, including the quantities to be purchased, price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. At December 31, 2021, there were standby letters of credit and bank guarantees of $511 million issued on our behalf. These are obtained primarily for regulatory purposes and payment guarantees to third-party payment processors.Marketing expenses and personnel expenses are the most significant operating expenses for our business. We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. See our Consolidated Statements of Operations and ""Trends"" and ""Results of Operations"" within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information on marketing expenses and personnel expenses including stock-based compensation expenses. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures, and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plans, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to compete or our future growth prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies, or repay our indebtedness. Cash Flow AnalysisNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.8 billion, resulting from net income of $1.2 billion and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.4 billion, and a favorable net change in working capital and other long-term assets and liabilities of $269 million. Non-cash items were principally associated with net losses on equity securities, deferred income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, and operating lease amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2021, accounts receivable increased by $1.0 billion and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities increased by $1.5 billion, primarily due to increases in business volumes.Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $85 million, resulting from net income of $59 million and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.0 billion, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $1.0 billion. Non-cash items were principally associated with net gains on marketable equity securities, impairment of goodwill, depreciation and amortization, provision for expected credit losses and chargebacks, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, deferred income tax expense, and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses related to Euro-denominated debt. For the year ended December 31, 2020, prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $161 million, primarily due to a refund for overpayment from a vendor and lower prepayment to third-party payment processors due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, accounts receivable decreased by $891 million and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities decreased by $2.3 billion primarily due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.0 billion, resulting from the acquisition of Getaroom of $1.2 billion, proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $508 million, net of purchases of $17 million, and purchase of property and equipment of $304 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.6 billion, resulting from the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $3.0 billion, net of purchases of $74 million, and the purchase of property and equipment of $286 million. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 includes payments of $52 million related to the turnkey agreement for constructing Booking.com's future headquarters. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.2 billion, almost entirely resulting from payments for redemption and conversion of debt of $3.1 billion and payments for the repurchase of common stock of $163 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $2.0 billion. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.5 billion, almost entirely resulting from the proceeds from the 58issuance of long-term debt of $4.1 billion, partially offset by payments for the repurchase of common stock of $1.3 billion and payments for the conversion of convertible notes of $1.2 billion. For a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and our cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.ContingenciesFrench tax authorities conducted audits of Booking.com for the years 2003 through 2012, 2013 through 2015, and 2016 through 2018. In December 2015, the French tax authorities issued Booking.com assessments for unpaid income and value added taxes (""VAT"") related to tax years 2006 through 2012 for approximately 356 million Euros ($403 million), the majority of which represents penalties and interest. The assessments assert that Booking.com had a permanent establishment in France. In December 2019, the French tax authorities issued an additional assessment of 70 million Euros ($80 million), including interest and penalties, for the 2013 year asserting that Booking.com had taxable income attributable to a permanent establishment in France. The French tax authorities also have issued assessments totaling 39 million Euros ($45 million), including interest and penalties, for certain tax years between 2011 and 2015 on Booking.com's French subsidiary asserting that the subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the services it rendered to Booking.com in the Netherlands. In December 2021, the French tax authorities issued assessments on Booking.com’s French subsidiary totaling 78 million Euros ($88 million), including interest and penalties, for the tax years 2016 through 2018 again asserting that the subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the services it rendered to Booking.com. As a result of a formal demand from the French tax authorities for payment of the amounts assessed against Booking.com for the years 2006 through 2012, in January 2019, we paid the assessments of approximately 356 million Euros ($403 million) in order to preserve our right to contest those assessments in court. The payment, which is included in ""Other assets, net"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, does not constitute an admission that we owe the taxes and will be refunded (with interest) to us to the extent we prevail. In December 2019 and October 2020, we initiated court proceedings with respect to certain of the assessments. Although we believe that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with French tax law, and we are contesting the assessments, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, we contacted the French tax authorities regarding the potential to achieve resolution of the matter through a settlement. After assessing several potential outcomes and potential settlement amounts and terms, an unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of 50 million Euros ($59 million) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, of which the majority was included as a partial reduction to the tax payment recorded in ""Other assets, net"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020. In December 2020, the French Administrative Court (Conseil d’Etat) delivered a decision in the ""ValueClick"" case that could have an impact on the outcome in our case. After considering the potential adverse impact of the new decision on the potential outcomes for the Booking.com assessments, we currently estimate that the reasonably possible loss related to VAT is approximately 20 million Euros ($22 million). For additional information related to the French and other tax assessments, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""Beginning in 2014, Booking.com received several letters from the Netherlands Pension Fund for the Travel Industry (Reiswerk) (""BPF"") claiming that Booking.com is required to participate in the mandatory pension scheme of the BPF with retroactive effect to 1999, which has a higher contribution rate than the pension scheme in which Booking.com is currently participating. BPF instituted legal proceedings against Booking.com and in 2016 the District Court of Amsterdam rejected all of BPF’s claims. BPF appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal, and, in May 2019, the Court of Appeal also rejected all of BPF’s claims, in each case by ruling that Booking.com does not meet the definition of a travel intermediary for purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. BPF then appealed to the Netherlands Supreme Court. In April 2021, the Supreme Court overturned the previous decision of the Court of Appeal and held that Booking.com meets the definition of a travel intermediary for the purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. The Supreme Court ruled only on the qualification of Booking.com as a travel intermediary for the purposes of the mandatory pension scheme, and did not rule on the various other defenses we brought forward against BPF's claims. The Supreme Court referred the matter to another Court of Appeal that will have to assess the other defenses we brought forward if BPF were to proceed with the litigation. We intend to pursue a number of defenses in any subsequent proceedings and may ultimately prevail in whole or in part. While we continue to believe that Booking.com is in compliance with its pension obligations and that the Court of Appeal could ultimately rule in favor of Booking.com, given the Supreme Court’s decision, we believe it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to this matter. We are not able to reasonably estimate a loss or a range of loss because there are significant factual and legal questions yet to be determined in any subsequent proceedings. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, we have not recorded a liability in connection with a potential adverse ultimate outcome to this litigation. However, if Booking.com were to ultimately lose and all of BPF’s claims were to be accepted (including with retroactive effect to 1999), we estimate that as of December 31, 2021, the maximum loss, not including any potential interest or penalties, would be approximately 289 million Euros ($328 million). Such estimated potential loss increases as Booking.com continues not to contribute to the BPF and depends on Booking.com’s applicable 59employee compensation after December 31, 2021. For additional information related to the pension matter and our other contingent liabilities, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have exposure to several types of market risk: changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices.We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign currency exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was $11.1 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively. We estimate that the fair value of such debt was approximately $12.1 billion and $14.0 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The estimated fair value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at December 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily relates to the conversion premium on the Convertible Senior Notes and the outstanding Senior Notes issued in April 2020. Excluding the effect on the fair value of our convertible senior notes, a hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of our other debt of approximately $401 million and $544 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our convertible senior notes are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of our shares than changes in interest rates. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will likely increase as the market price of our shares increases and will likely decrease as the market price of our shares falls. Our businesses outside of the U.S. represent a substantial majority of our financial results. Therefore, because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our businesses outside of the U.S. are translated from local currencies (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currencies. For example, total revenues from our businesses outside of the U.S. increased by 58% in 2021 as compared to 2020, but without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 57%. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have a significant investment that is denominated in Hong Kong Dollars and the related impact from the movements in foreign currency exchange rates is recognized in ""Other income (expense), net"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We designate certain portions of the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. The foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in ""Other income (expense), net"" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the amount of net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiaries, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 60We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instruments in the future. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our derivative contracts. We are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies. We recorded net losses of $569 million and net gains of $1.8 billion and $745 million related to these equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively (see Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies, excluding investments classified as debt securities for accounting purposes, were $2.9 billion and $325 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021, and $3.1 billion and $455 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Our investments in private companies, excluding investments classified as debt securities for accounting purposes, are measured at cost less impairment, if any. Such investments are also required to be measured at fair value as of the date of certain observable transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values at December 31, 2021 and 2020 of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies would have resulted in a loss, before tax, of approximately $320 million and $355 million, respectively, being recognized in net income. As of February 22, 2022, the market prices of Meituan's shares, DiDi's ADSs, and Grab's shares decreased by 24%, 15%, and 27%, respectively, as compared to their respective market prices on December 31, 2021.",2023-12-30 18:44:01.162895
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2023,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, and the Section entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in any forward-looking statements, which may be due to factors discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.OverviewOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We connect consumers who wish to make travel reservations with travel service providers around the world through our online platforms. We offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating segments. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to revenue by geographic area.We derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from advertising services, restaurant reservations and restaurant management services, and various other services, such as travel-related insurance revenues.TrendsThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting implementation of travel restrictions by governments around the world resulted in a significant decline in travel activities and consumer demand for related services. Accommodation room nights, which include the impact of cancellations, declined rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic spread in 2020. Since the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and through 2022, changes in accommodation room nights versus the comparable period in 2019 have generally improved as government-imposed travel restrictions have eased, vaccines and other medical interventions have become more widespread, and consumer demand for travel has generally rebounded. In 2021, room nights were 66% higher than in 2020 but still 30% lower than in 2019. On a regional basis, considering where the traveler is booking from, North America was the only region in 2021 to have room nights increase versus 2019. In 2022, global room nights were 52% higher than in 2021 and 6% higher than in 2019. The year-over-year growth in room nights in 2022 was driven primarily by the continued recovery in Europe, Asia, and Rest of World, as well as by continued growth in North America.37The comparison of room nights in 2021 and 2022 to the comparable period in 2019 avoids the distortion created from comparing to a prior year period that was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.Quarterly Room Nights and Change versus 2019In early March 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we suspended the booking of travel services in Russia and Belarus. This led to the loss of new bookings from bookers in these countries. Excluding room nights from bookers in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus in both 2022 and 2019, our overall room nights in 2022 were up about 10% versus 2019.We have observed an improvement in cancellation rates since the high in April 2020, though we have seen periods of elevated cancellation rates typically coinciding with significant increases in COVID-19 cases and newly imposed travel restrictions. The cancellation rate in 2022 improved compared to the cancellation rates in 2021 and 2019. In 2022, a higher share of our room nights were booked with flexible cancellation policies, as compared to 2019 and 2021, which could result in higher cancellation rates in future periods. Because we recognize revenue from bookings when the traveler checks in, our reported revenue is not at risk of being reversed due to cancellations. Increases in cancellation rates can negatively impact our marketing efficiency as a result of incurring performance marketing expense at the time a booking is made even though that booking could be canceled in the future if it was booked under a flexible cancellation policy. There are many factors in addition to cancellation rates that contribute to marketing efficiency including average daily rates (""ADRs""), costs per click, foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking consumers, the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns, and the extent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings. Significant increases in cancellation rates such as those experienced during the second quarter of 2020 may increase our customer service costs. 38Since the second quarter of 2020, government-imposed travel restrictions have generally limited international travel (travelers booking a stay at a property located outside their own country) more than domestic travel (travelers booking a stay within their own country). We believe the continued easing of government-imposed travel restrictions in many countries throughout the world in 2022 helped drive an increase in the mix of our room nights booked for international travel versus 2021, however, the mix remained below 2019 levels. We saw an increase in the mix of our room nights booked on a mobile device in 2022 compared to 2019. When comparing 2022 to 2021, we saw a decrease in the mix of our room nights booked on a mobile device in 2022 due to a year-over-year increase in the mix of our room nights booked for international travel and a year-over-year expansion of the booking window. Room nights booked on a mobile device generally have a lower mix of international travel and a shorter booking window than room nights booked on a desktop. The mix of our room nights booked on a mobile app in 2022 was above 2019 and 2021. We continue to see favorable repeat direct booking behavior from consumers in our mobile apps, which allow us more opportunities to engage directly with consumers. The revenue earned on a transaction from a mobile device may be less than a typical desktop transaction as we see different consumer purchasing patterns across devices. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and have lower accommodation ADRs.Our global ADRs increased approximately 25%, on a constant currency basis, in 2022 as compared to 2019, driven primarily by higher ADRs for accommodations located in Europe as well as increases in ADRs across all other regions as compared to 2019. In addition, we estimate that our global ADRs in 2022, as compared to 2019, benefited by approximately two percentage points from changes in the geographical mix of our business driven primarily by slower room night recovery in Asia, which is a low ADR region, and stronger room night performance in North America, which is a high ADR region. Our global ADRs increased approximately 15%, on a constant currency basis, in 2022 as compared to 2021, driven primarily by higher ADRs in Europe as well as increases in ADRs across all other regions as compared to 2021. The increase in our global ADRs in 2022, as compared to 2021, was negatively impacted by approximately three percentage points from changes in geographical mix in our business driven primarily by stronger year-over-year room night growth in Asia and lower year-over-year room night growth in North America. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a trend of declining constant-currency accommodation ADRs partially driven by the negative impact of the changing geographical mix of our business (e.g., lower ADR regions like Asia were generally growing faster than higher ADR regions like Western Europe and North America) as well as pricing pressures within local markets from time to time. Those declining ADR trends resulted in accommodation gross bookings growing less than room nights. As the travel market continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and with all regions experiencing general inflation in prices, we have seen travel industry ADRs generally increasing from pandemic lows in 2020. While our ADRs have continued to increase in 2022 as compared to 2019, it remains highly uncertain what the trend in industry ADRs will look like going forward.We focus on relentless innovation to grow our business by, among other things, providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms to ensure that we are meeting the needs of online consumers while aiming to exceed their expectations. As part of these ongoing efforts, we have a long-term strategy to build a seamless offering of multiple elements of travel, allowing us to provide a more tailored and flexible consumer experience, which we refer to as the ""Connected Trip,"" and we expect these efforts to increase room night growth and revenue growth over time. We may see a negative impact on our operating margins in the near term as we incur the expenses associated with Connected Trip-related investments. Further, to the extent our non-accommodation services (e.g., airline ticket reservation services) have lower margins and increase as a percentage of our total business, our operating margins may be negatively affected. As part of our strategy to provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com, and enable our long-term Connected Trip strategy, Booking.com increasingly processes transactions on a merchant basis, where it facilitates payments from travelers for the services provided. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer secure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that expanding these types of service offerings will benefit consumers and travel service providers, as well as our gross bookings, room night, and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional expenses for personnel, payment processing, chargebacks (including those related to fraud), and other expenses related to these transactions, which are recorded in ""Personnel"" and ""Sales and other expenses"" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as associated incremental revenues (e.g., credit card rebates), which are recorded in ""Merchant revenues."" To the extent more of our business is generated on a merchant basis, we incur a greater level of these merchant-related expenses, which negatively impacts our operating margins despite increases in associated incremental revenues. The mix of our gross bookings generated on a merchant basis was 44% in 2022, an increase from 34% in 2021 and 27% in 2019.39We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Our total marketing expenses, which are comprised of performance and brand marketing expenses that are substantially variable in nature, were $6.0 billion in 2022, up 58% versus 2021 and up 21% versus 2019 as a result of the improving demand environment and our efforts to invest in marketing. Our performance marketing expense, which represents a substantial majority of our marketing expense, is primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services, and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our platforms. Our brand marketing expense is primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing television advertising, online video advertising (for example, on YouTube and Facebook), and online display advertising.Marketing efficiency, expressed as marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings, and performance marketing returns on investment (""ROIs"") are impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and are in some cases outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers, and the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns. In recent years, we observed periods of stable or increasing ROIs. Although it is difficult to predict how performance marketing ROIs will change in the future, ROIs could be negatively impacted by increased levels of competition and other factors. When evaluating our performance marketing spend, we typically consider several factors for each channel, such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incremental traffic we receive, and anticipated repeat rates.Marketing efficiency can also be impacted by the extent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings. Marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross bookings in 2022 were lower than 2019 despite lower performance marketing ROIs due to an increase in the share of room nights booked by consumers coming directly to our platforms. Performance marketing ROIs were lower in 2022 versus 2019 due to our efforts to invest in marketing during the recovery in the travel industry in 2022. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our platforms and grow our business,"" and ""Our business could be negatively affected by changes in online search and meta-search algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.""Historically, our growth has primarily been generated by the worldwide accommodation reservation business of Booking.com due in part to the availability of a large number of properties through Booking.com. Booking.com included over 2.7 million properties on its website at December 31, 2022, consisting of over 400,000 hotels, motels, and resorts and approximately 2.3 million alternative accommodation properties (including homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay), and representing an increase from approximately 2.4 million properties at December 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase in total properties was driven primarily by an increase in alternative accommodation properties.The mix of Booking.com’s room nights booked for alternative accommodation properties in 2022 was approximately 30%, up slightly versus 2019 and 2021. We have observed an overall longer-term trend of an increasing mix of room nights booked for alternative accommodation properties as consumer demand for these types of properties has grown, and as we have increased the number and variety of alternative accommodation properties available to consumers on Booking.com. We may experience lower profit margins due to additional costs, such as increased customer service costs, related to offering alternative accommodations on our platforms. As our alternative accommodation business has grown, these different characteristics have negatively impacted our profit margins and this trend may continue. Although we believe that providing an extensive collection of properties, excellent customer service, and an intuitive, easy-to-use consumer experience are important factors influencing a consumer's decision to make a reservation, for many consumers, the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether a consumer will book a reservation. Discounting and couponing (i.e., merchandising) occurs across all of the major regions in which we operate, particularly in Asia. In some cases, our competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction, or offer travel services at a loss, in order to gain market share. As a result, it is increasingly important to offer travel services, such as accommodation reservations, at a competitive price, whether through discounts, coupons, closed-user group rates or loyalty programs, increased flexibility in cancellation policies, or otherwise. These initiatives have resulted and, in the future, may result in lower ADRs and lower revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. Total revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was negatively impacted by investments in merchandising in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2019.Many taxing authorities are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues and have targeted large multinational technology companies in these efforts. As a result, many countries and some U.S. states have implemented or are considering the adoption of a digital services tax or similar tax that imposes a tax on revenue earned from digital advertisements or the use of online platforms, even when there is no physical presence in the jurisdiction. Currently, rates for this tax range from 1.5% to 10% of revenue deemed generated in the jurisdiction. The digital services taxes currently in effect, which we record in ""General and administrative"" expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, have negatively impacted our 40results of operations. While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been working on multinational tax changes that could require all member parties to remove all digital services taxes, the timing for completion of that project has been delayed and many details remain uncertain. If that project is significantly delayed or not completed more countries could implement digital services taxes, which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""Increased regulatory focus on online businesses, including online travel businesses like ours, could result in increased compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, the Digital Markets Act (""DMA"") and Digital Services Act (""DSA"") give regulators in the EU more instruments to investigate and regulate digital businesses and impose new rules and requirements on platforms designated as ""gatekeepers"" under the DMA and online platforms more generally, with separate rules for ""Very Large Online Platforms"" under the DSA. For more information on the impacts of regulations on our business, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Our business is subject to various competition/anti-trust, consumer protection, and online commerce laws, rules, and regulations around the world, and as the size of our business grows, scrutiny of our business by legislators and regulators in these areas may intensify."" Our businesses outside of the U.S. (see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) represent a substantial majority of our financial results, but because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our businesses outside of the U.S. are translated from local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. For example, the U.S. Dollar strengthened in 2022 versus both the Euro and British Pound Sterling by 11% and 10%, respectively, as compared to 2021. As aresult of the movements in foreign currency exchange rates, both the absolute amounts of and percentage changes in our foreign-currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars are affected. Our total revenues increased by 56% in 2022 as compared to 2021, but without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates our total revenue increased year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 71%. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. We designate certain portions of the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in ""Other income (expense), net"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Notes 12 and 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the amount of net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiaries, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.""We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our derivative contracts.Other FactorsOver the long term, we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology, and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. In recent years, we have experienced pressure on operating margins as we invested in initiatives to drive future growth. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, including exploring strategic alternatives such as acquisitions.The competition for technology talent in our industry is intense, including among established technology companies, startups, and companies transitioning to digital, and this level of competition could continue in the future. As a result of the competitive labor market and inflationary pressure on compensation, our personnel expenses to attract and retain key talent are increasing, which may adversely affect our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees or hire, retain, and motivate well-qualified employees, our business would be harmed.""41OutlookIn January 2023, we saw an improvement in the monthly room night growth rate versus 2019 relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, with room nights growing about 26% versus January 2019, driven primarily by improvements in Europe, Rest of World, and Asia. On a year-over-year basis, room night growth in January 2023 was 60%, due in part to the negative impact of the Omicron variant on January 2022 room nights. While there continues to be uncertainty around the month to month trends, we assume that room night growth in the first quarter of 2023 will grow by over 30% relative to the first quarter of 2022. Given that assumption for room night growth, we expect the following for the first quarter of 2023:•the year-over-year growth in gross bookings will be about four percentage points better than the year-over-year growth in room nights;•revenues as a percentage of gross bookings will be higher than it was in the first quarter of 2022; and•operating profit will be higher than in the first quarter of 2022.For the full year, assuming gross bookings increase in 2023 compared to 2022 by a low teens percentage, we expect the following for full-year 2023:•revenues as a percentage of gross bookings will be higher than it was in 2022; and•operating profit will be higher than in 2019 and 2022.Critical Accounting EstimatesManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""). Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of `certain estimates and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Matters that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following:Valuation of Investments in Private CompaniesSee Notes 2, 5, and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the investments in private companies and information on fair value measurements, including the three levels of inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. When inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (observable market data), are available at the measurement date and are not significantly adjusted using unobservable inputs, the observable inputs would be classified as Level 2 inputs. When little or no market data is available, the fair value of these investments are measured using unobservable inputs (""Level 3 inputs""). Our investments measured using Level 3 inputs primarily consist of investments in privately-held companies that were classified as either debt securities or equity securities without readily determinable fair values. Fair values of privately held securities are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies, including both market and income approaches. We use valuation techniques appropriate for the type of investment and the information available about the investee as of the valuation date to determine fair value. Recent financing transactions in the investee are generally considered the best indication of the enterprise value and therefore used as a basis to estimate fair value. However, based on a number of factors, such as the proximity to the valuation date or the volume or other terms of these financing transactions, we may also use other valuation techniques to supplement this data, including the income approach. When a recent financing transaction occurs and represents fair value, we also use the calibration process, as appropriate, when estimating fair value on subsequent measurement dates. Calibration is the process of using observed transactions in the investee company's own instruments to ensure that the valuation techniques that will be employed to value the investee company investment on subsequent measurement dates begin with assumptions that are consistent with the original observed transaction as well as any more recent observed transactions in the instruments issued by the investee company. In July 2021, Yanolja announced a new round of funding which was completed in October 2021 along with certain other transactions. As a result of these observable transactions, we increased the carrying value of our investment in Yanolja to 42$306 million as of December 31, 2021. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, considering the significant adverse changes in the market valuations of companies in the travel and technology industries, we evaluated our investment in Yanolja for impairment and recognized an impairment charge of $184 million resulting in an adjusted carrying value of $122 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. As discussed below, we used unobservable inputs to determine fair value. We used a combination of the market approach and the income approach in estimating the fair value of our investment in Yanolja as of June 30, 2022. The market approach estimates value using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable companies. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on a company’s weighted-average cost of capital, and is adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in its cash flows. The key unobservable inputs and ranges used in estimating the fair value of our investment in Yanolja as of June 30, 2022 include, for the market approach, percentage decrease in the calibrated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (""EBITDA"") multiple (36%) and for the income approach, the weighted average cost of capital (10%-14%) and terminal EBITDA multiple (14x-16x). Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly different fair value measurements. Generally, a change in the assumption used for EBITDA multiples would result in a directionally similar change in the fair value and a change in the assumption used for weighted average cost of capital would result in a directionally opposite change in the fair value. The determination of the fair values of investments in private companies, where we are a minority shareholder and have access to limited information from the investee, reflects numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including key assumptions regarding the investee’s expected growth rates and operating margin, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates and market comparables. It requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates used. Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in our valuation, which may result in a need to recognize additional impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Valuation of Goodwill and other Long-lived AssetsThe application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair value are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable. When we deem appropriate, we utilize assistance from third-party valuation firms. The consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amounts allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.A substantial portion of our intangible assets and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable, KAYAK, and Getaroom. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.We review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2022, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. The estimation of fair values of our reporting units reflect numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including key assumptions regarding each reporting unit’s expected growth rates and operating margin and the competitive environment, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates and market comparables. Generally, changes in the assumptions used for comparable company multiples would result in directionally similar changes in the fair value and changes in the assumptions used for discount rates would result in directionally opposite changes in the fair value. The estimation of fair value requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than the judgments and estimates used. During 2022, there have been significant adverse changes in the market valuation of companies in the travel and technology industries. Discount rates have also been impacted during the period due to rising interest rates and adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment. Future events and changing market conditions, including economic uncertainties such as inflation, rising interest rates and risks of a potential 43recession, may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units, which may result in a need to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.During the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the deterioration of the Company’s business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company recorded significant goodwill impairment charges (described below) related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit. For the 2020 annual goodwill impairment test and subsequent annual tests, including as of September 30, 2022, the estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples). The carrying value of goodwill assigned to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit was $973 million as of September 30, 2022. Future events and changing market conditions, including adverse changes in discount rates and market comparables, may require us to revise our assumptions and estimate a lower fair value for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit at a future date, which may result in a need to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If the discount rate used in the income approach as of September 30, 2022 increases or decreases by 0.5%, the impact to the estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK, at September 30, 2022, would have ranged from a decrease of approximately $98 million to an increase of approximately $111 million. If the comparable company multiple used in the market approach as of September 30, 2022 increases or decreases by 1x, the impact to the estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK, at September 30, 2022, would have ranged from an increase of approximately $159 million to a decrease of approximately $159 million.2020 Interim Goodwill Impairment TestDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2), we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples). The income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches). 2020 Annual Goodwill Impairment TestAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services.The estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples). The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we assumed a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance would occur in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within five years from that date, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations. An increase or decrease of one percentage point to the profitability growth rates used in the cash flow projections would have resulted in an increase or 44decrease of approximately $100 million to the estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK as of September 30, 2020. The discount rate is determined based on the reporting unit’s estimated weighted-average cost of capital and adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in its cash flows, which requires significant judgments. The discount rate used for the annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2020 was higher than the discount rate used for the interim goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020. If the discount rate used in the income approach increases or decreases by 0.5%, the impact to the estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK, at September 30, 2020, would have ranged from a decrease of approximately $65 million to an increase of approximately $70 million.Income Taxes We determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") enacted in December 2017 made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a one-time deemed repatriation tax imposed on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. We do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject to U.S. taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI""). We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences, and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. We have been audited in many jurisdictions and from time to time face challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and comply with applicable law, we regularly review our tax filing positions, especially in light of tax law or business practice changes, and we may change our positions or determine that previous positions should be amended, either of which could result in additional tax liabilities. The final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The evaluation of tax positions and recognition of income tax benefits require significant judgment and we consult with external tax and legal counsel as appropriate. We consider the technical merits of our tax positions along with the applicable tax statutes, related interpretations and precedents, and our expectation of the outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with tax authorities. We recognize liabilities when we believe that uncertain positions may not be fully sustained upon audit by the tax authorities, including any related appeals or litigation processes. Liabilities recognized for uncertain tax positions are based on a two-step approach for recognition and measurement. First, we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. Second, we measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties attributable to uncertain tax positions, if any, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The tax benefits ultimately realized by us may be different than what is recorded in the financial statements due to future events such as our settling the matter with the tax authorities and our success in sustaining our tax positions. See Notes 15 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.ContingenciesLoss contingencies (other than income tax-related contingencies disclosed above) arise from actual or possible claims and assessments and pending or threatened litigation that may be brought against us. Based on our assessment of loss contingencies at each balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial statements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose information about the contingency in the financial statements. We also disclose information in our financial statements about reasonably possible loss contingencies. The determination of whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated requires significant judgment and evaluation of all the underlying facts and circumstances, including judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants, regulatory authorities, and courts. Claims, assessments, and litigations involve significant uncertainties such as the complexity of the facts, the legal theories involved, the nature of the claims, the judgment of the courts, the applicable methodology for determining potential damages, and, in the case of class actions, whether a class action can be certified and the extent to which members of a class would or would not file a claim.45On a quarterly basis, we update our analysis and estimates considering all available information, including the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, and advice of legal counsel. Changes in our assessment of whether a loss is probable, our estimate of the loss, or our determination of whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Changes in our assumptions regarding a particular matter or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal and other proceedings could also have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. For all loss contingencies, until a matter is finally resolved, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the liability accrued for the matter and such amounts could be material.See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details, which is incorporated into this Item 7 by reference thereto.46Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2022 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our year-over-year growth in gross bookings, revenues, and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-related services. Specifically, reservations of room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked through our online travel companies' (""OTC"") brands by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through our OTC brands by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. Our non-OTC brands (KAYAK and OpenTable) have different business metrics from those of our OTC brands, so search queries through KAYAK and restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not contribute to our gross bookings.Room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Room nights89659151.6 %Rental car days624730.7 %Airline tickets231549.9 % Room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets reserved through our services increased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, due primarily to the continued improvement in travel demand trends as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lessened in 2022 versus 2021. Gross bookings resulting from reservations of room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets made through our agency and merchant categories for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Agency gross bookings$67,379 $50,741 32.8 %Merchant gross bookings53,873 25,845 108.4 %Total gross bookings$121,253 $76,586 58.3 % Agency gross bookings are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided, while merchant gross bookings are derived from services where we facilitate payments. Agency and merchant gross bookings increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to the continued improvement in travel demand trends. Merchant gross bookings increased more than agency gross bookings due to the expansion of merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com.The year-over-year increase in gross bookings in 2022 was due primarily to the increase in room nights and the increase in accommodation ADRs of approximately 15% on a constant-currency basis, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Gross bookings resulting from reservations of airline tickets increased 86% year-over-year in 2022 due to higher unit growth and ticket price increases. Gross bookings resulting from reservations of rental car days increased 26% year-over-year in 2022 due primarily to higher unit growth. 47 RevenuesOnline travel reservation servicesSubstantially all of our revenues are generated by providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases between travel service providers and travelers. Revenues from online travel reservation services are classified into two categories: •Agency. Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided. Agency revenues consist almost entirely of travel reservation commissions from our accommodation, rental car, and airline reservation services. Substantially all of our agency revenue is from Booking.com's accommodation reservations. •Merchant. Merchant revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided, generally at the time of booking. Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where travelers book accommodation, rental car, airline reservations, and other travel related services. The majority of our merchant revenue is from Booking.com's accommodation reservations. Merchant revenues include:◦travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers, including the impact of merchandising, less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our merchant reservation services; ◦revenues from facilitating payments, such as credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees; and ◦ancillary fees, including travel-related insurance revenues. Advertising and other revenuesAdvertising and other revenues are derived primarily from:•revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on its platforms; and •revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) restaurant reservation services (fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service) and (b) subscription fees for restaurant management services.

Merchant revenues in 2022 increased more than agency revenues due to the expansion of merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com.Total revenues as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.1% in 2022, down from 14.3% in 2021 due to investments in merchandising and an increase in the mix of airline ticket gross bookings, partially offset by increased revenues from facilitating payments.48Operating Expenses Marketing Expenses Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Marketing expenses$5,993 $3,801 57.6 %% of Total gross bookings4.9 %5.0 %% of Total revenues35.1 %34.7 % Marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of: •search engine keyword purchases;•referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; •affiliate programs; •offline and online brand marketing; and •other performance-based marketing and incentives. We adjust our marketing spend based on our growth and profitability objectives, as well as the travel demand and expected ROIs in our marketing channels. We rely on our marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. Our marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, due primarily to the continued improvement in travel demand as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lessened in 2022 versus 2021. Marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross bookings decreased slightly in 2022 compared to 2021 due to year-over-year increases in the mix of direct traffic, partially offset by year-over-year decreases in performance marketing ROIs. Performance marketing ROIs were lower in 2022 versus 2021 due to our efforts to invest in marketing during the recovery in the travel industry in 2022.Sales and Other Expenses Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Sales and other expenses$1,818 $881 106.3 %% of Total gross bookings1.5 %1.2 %% of Total revenues10.6 %8.0 % Sales and other expenses consist primarily of: •credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; •fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations, and other services; •chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; •provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers; and•customer relations costs. Sales and other expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, due primarily to an increase in merchant transaction costs of $573 million, and an increase in third-party call center costs of $235 million. Merchant transactions increased year-over-year in 2022 due to the continued improvement in travel demand trends as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lessened in 2022 versus 2021, as well as the expansion of merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com. The year-over-year increase in third-party call center costs in 2022 was due in part to the transfer of certain customer service operations of Booking.com to Majorel, which shifted costs from personnel expenses to sales and other expenses.49Personnel Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Personnel$2,465 $2,314 6.5 %% of Total revenues14.4 %21.1 % Personnel expenses consist primarily of: •salaries; •bonuses;•stock-based compensation; •payroll taxes; and •employee health and other benefits. Personnel expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, increased 6% in 2022 compared to 2021, due to an increase in salary expense of $139 million and an increase in bonus expense accruals of $66 million, partially offset by the $136 million expense, recorded in 2021, associated with the return of government assistance received through various government aid programs. Employee headcount of approximately 21,600 as of December 31, 2022 increased by 6% as compared to December 31, 2021. Personnel expenses in 2022 and employee headcount as of December 31, 2022 were reduced due to the transfer of certain customer service operations of Booking.com to Majorel which shifted costs from personnel expenses to sales and other expenses. Stock-based compensation expense was $404 million in 2022 compared to $370 million in 2021.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021General and administrative$934 $620 50.9 %% of Total revenues5.5 %5.7 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: •indirect taxes such as digital services taxes and travel transaction taxes;•fees for outside professionals;•occupancy and office expenses; and•personnel-related expenses such as travel, relocation, recruiting, and training expenses. General and administrative expenses increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to an increase of $167 million in indirect taxes driven by higher digital services taxes, as well as the $46 million accrual related to the potential settlement of an Italian indirect tax matter. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses was also driven by an increase of $75 million in personnel-related expenses and an increase of $53 million in fees for professional services. The year-over-year increase in digital services taxes was driven by the improvement in revenue.Information Technology Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Information technology$526 $412 27.6 %% of Total revenues3.1 %3.8 %Information technology expenses consist primarily of: •software license and system maintenance fees;•cloud computing costs and outsourced data center costs;•payments to contractors; and •data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services. 50Information technology expenses increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to increased cloud computing costs, payments to contractors, and software license fees. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Depreciation and amortization$451 $421 6.9 %% of Total revenues2.6 %3.8 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: •amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; •amortization of internally-developed and purchased software; •depreciation of computer equipment; and •depreciation of leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and office equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to increased amortization expense related to the acquisition of Getaroom, partially offset by decreased depreciation of computer equipment and leasehold improvements.Restructuring, Disposal, and Other Exit Activities Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Restructuring, disposal, and other exit activities$(199)$13 *% of Total revenues(1.2)%0.1 %* Not meaningful Restructuring, disposal, and other exit activities in 2022 includes the gain of $240 million on the sale and leaseback transaction related to Booking.com's future headquarters building (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a loss of $41 million related to the transfer of certain customer service operations of Booking.com to Majorel. Restructuring, disposal, and other exit activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 principally relate to the restructuring charges as a result of restructuring actions taken in 2020 and are primarily related to employee severance and other termination benefits at Booking.com (see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Interest Expense Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Interest expense$391 $334 16.9 % Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher interest rates relating to our cash management activities (with related income recorded in interest income) and the issuance of senior notes in November 2022. This was offset in part by the impact of the adoption on January 1, 2022 of the new accounting standards update for convertible instruments, the redemption of senior notes with higher interest rates in April 2021, and the maturity in September 2021 of convertible senior notes. The amortization of debt discount on convertible debt was recorded in Interest expense. With the adoption of the new accounting standards update, such amortization is not recorded in the financial statements for periods after January 1, 2022 (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Other income (expense), net$(788)$(697)13.1 %51The following table sets forth the composition of ""Other income (expense), net"" for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:Year Ended December 31,(in millions)20222021Interest and dividend income$219 $16 Net losses on equity securities(963)(569)Foreign currency transaction (losses) gains(43)111 Loss on early extinguishment of debt— (242)Other(1)(13)Other income (expense), net$(788)$(697)See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Interest and dividend income increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on cash management activities (with related expenses recorded in interest expense) and investment activities. See Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to net losses on equity securities and the impairment of an investment in equity securities. Foreign currency transaction (losses) gains for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes gains of $46 million related to our Euro-denominated debt and accrued interest that were not designated as net investment hedges and losses of $52 million on derivative contracts. Foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes gains of $135 million related to our Euro-denominated debt and accrued interest that were not designated as net investment hedges and losses of $30 million on derivative contracts. Loss on early extinguishment of debt is related to our Senior Notes due April 2025 and our Senior Notes due April 2027 that were redeemed in April 2021 (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Income Taxes Year Ended December 31,Increase (Decrease)(in millions)20222021Income tax expense$865 $300 188.6 %% of Income before income taxes22.1 %20.5 % Our 2022 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to higher international tax rates, a valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to certain unrealized losses on equity securities, certain non-deductible expenses, and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax (discussed below). Our 2021 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax, partially offset by higher international tax rates and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits. Our effective tax rate was higher for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower benefit resulting from the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax and higher valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to certain unrealized losses on equity securities, partially offset by lower international tax rates. Under Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 9% (""Innovation Box Tax"") for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021 rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. Previously, the Innovation Box Tax rate was 7%. Effective January 1, 2022, the Netherlands corporate income tax rate increased from 25% to 25.8%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on our effective tax rates for these periods. For more information regarding the Innovation Box Tax, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may not be able to maintain our 'Innovation Box Tax' benefit.""52Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2021 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2022.53Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on facilitating the sale of travel-related services. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting implementation of restrictive measures resulted in a significant decline in travel activities and consumer demand for related services, in 2020 in particular. For more information, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""The COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely affected, and may further adversely impact, our business and financial performance.""Marketing expenses and personnel expenses are the most significant operating expenses for our business. We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. See our Consolidated Statements of Operations and ""Trends"" and ""Results of Operations"" above for additional information on marketing expenses and personnel expenses including stock-based compensation expenses.Our continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our ability to meet debt covenant requirements, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or financing sources were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry or us, our access to capital and the cost of any financing would be negatively impacted. There is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants than those we are currently subject to, which could restrict our business operations. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""Our liquidity, credit ratings, and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by global financial conditions and events.""At December 31, 2022, we had $15.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $9.3 billion is held by our international subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and long-term investments held by our international subsidiaries are denominated primarily in Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and British Pounds Sterling. Cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments are principally comprised of money market fund investments, time deposits and certificates of deposit, government and corporate debt securities, equity securities of Meituan, Grab Holdings Limited (""Grab"") and DiDi Global Inc. (""DiDi""), and our investments in private companies. We completed the sale of our investment in equity securities of Meituan in February 2023 and received gross proceeds of $1.7 billion. See Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Deferred merchant bookings of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2022 represents cash payments received from travelers in advance of us completing our performance obligations and are comprised principally of amounts estimated to be payable to travel service providers as well as our estimated future revenue for our commission or margin and fees. The amounts are mostly subject to refunds for cancellations.At December 31, 2022, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $811 million as a result of the Tax Act, which included $711 million reported as ""Long-term U.S. transition tax liability"" and $100 million included in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This liability will be paid over the next four years. In accordance with the Tax Act, generally, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by us. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted into law in the United States. The key provisions applicable to us include a 15% corporate minimum tax on book income. In addition, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""In August 2019, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $80 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $100 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The proceeds of loans made under the facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayments. At December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding and $14 million of letters of credit issued under this revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant. After a 2020 amendment to the revolving credit facility, the permitted maximum leverage ratio is increased through and including the three months ending March 31, 2023 and we may not declare or make any cash distribution or repurchase any of our shares (with certain exceptions including in connection with tax withholding related to shares issued to employees) unless we are in compliance on a pro forma basis with the maximum leverage ratio covenant then in effect. Such restriction ends upon delivery of financial statements required for the three months ending June 30, 2023, or we have the ability to terminate this restriction earlier if we demonstrate compliance with the original maximum leverage ratio covenant in the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2022, we were 54in compliance with the relevant maximum leverage ratio covenant. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the maximum leverage ratio covenant at any particular time, and our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility depends on compliance with the covenant. Further, the lenders have the right to require repayment of any amounts borrowed under the facility if we are not in compliance with the covenant.In November 2022, the Company issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of 3.5 billion Euros with interest rates ranging from 4.0% to 4.75% and with maturity dates ranging from November 2026 to November 2034. The Company paid $19 million in debt issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the issuance of these senior notes. A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used to repay the Senior Notes due November 2022 (the ""November 2022 Notes""). In addition, we intend to repay the Senior Notes due March 2023 from these proceeds upon maturity. The remaining proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes are available to be used for general corporate purposes.In November 2022, we repaid $778 million on the maturity of the November 2022 Notes. In March 2022, the Company repaid $1.1 billion on the maturity of Senior Notes due March 2022. In addition, the Company paid the applicable accrued and unpaid interest relating to these senior notes. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding senior notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $12.5 billion, with $500 million payable within the next twelve months. The senior notes had a cumulative interest to maturity of $2.4 billion, with $365 million payable within the next twelve months. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt arrangements, including principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $6.7 billion. At December 31, 2022, we had a total remaining amount of $3.9 billion authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock. In February 2023, our Board authorized a program to repurchase up to an additional $20.0 billion of our common stock. We expect to complete repurchases under the two authorizations within the next four years, assuming we remain in compliance with the applicable maximum leverage ratio covenant under the credit facility amendment. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has mandated a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases effective from January 1, 2023. See Notes 12 and 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock repurchases subsequent to December 31, 2022 were approximately $542 million as of February 22, 2023. In November 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire global flight booking provider Etraveli Group for approximately 1.6 billion Euros ($1.7 billion). Completion of the acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. In December 2022, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction for Booking.com’s future headquarters building. The building was sold for an aggregate consideration of approximately 566 million Euros ($601 million) and we concurrently entered into an agreement to lease the building from the purchaser for an initial term of 16.5 years, with up to five renewal options of five years each. The annual base rent under the lease is 24 million Euros ($26 million) and will increase annually based on the consumer price index, subject to a specified ceiling. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.At December 31, 2022, we had lease obligations of $867 million. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our obligations related to operating and financing leases. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we had, in the aggregate, $378 million of non-cancellable purchase obligations individually greater than $10 million payable over the next five years, of which $143 million is payable within the next twelve months. Such purchase obligations relate to agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding, that specify all significant terms, including the quantities to be purchased, price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. At December 31, 2022 there were $452 million of standby letters of credit and bank guarantees issued on our behalf. These are obtained primarily for regulatory purposes.See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our commitments and contingencies.We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures, and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plans, 55either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to compete or our future growth prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies, or repay our indebtedness.Cash Flow AnalysisYear Ended December 31, 2022 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $6.6 billion, resulting from net income of $3.1 billion, a favorable net impact of $1.7 billion from adjustments for non-cash items and the gain on the sale and leaseback transaction, and a favorable net change in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $1.8 billion. Non-cash items were principally associated with net losses on equity securities, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, deferred income tax benefit, provision for expected credit losses and chargebacks, and operating lease amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2022, deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities increased by $3.7 billion, and accounts receivable increased by $1.2 billion, primarily due to increases in business volumes.Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.8 billion, resulting from net income of $1.2 billion, a favorable impact of $1.4 billion from adjustments for non-cash items and the loss on early extinguishment of debt, and a favorable net change in working capital and other long-term assets and liabilities of $269 million. Non-cash items were principally associated with net losses on equity securities, deferred income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, and operating lease amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2021, accounts receivable increased by $1.0 billion and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities increased by $1.5 billion, primarily due to increases in business volumes.Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $518 million, principally resulting from purchases of investments of $768 million, primarily in various corporate and government debt securities (see Note 5), as well as from purchases of property and equipment of $368 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from the sale and leaseback transaction of $601 million and proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments of $32 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.0 billion, principally resulting from the acquisition of Getaroom of $1.2 billion and purchases of property and equipment of $304 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments of $508 million, net of purchases of $17 million.Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $4.9 billion, almost entirely resulting from payments for the repurchase of common stock of $6.6 billion and payments on the maturity of debt of $1.9 billion. This was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $3.6 billion. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.2 billion, almost entirely resulting from payments on the redemption and conversion of debt of $3.1 billion and payments for the repurchase of common stock of $163 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $2.0 billion. Year Ended December 31, 2021 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 For a comparison of our cash flow activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2022.ContingenciesFor information related to the French and other tax assessments and other tax matters, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors - ""We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.""For information related to the pension matter and our other contingent liabilities, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.56Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have exposure to several types of market risk: changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices.We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign currency exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk.The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow, and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions, and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or, except in certain limited situations, execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. To the extent that changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was $12.5 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively. We estimate that the fair value of such debt was approximately $12.4 billion and $12.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of the Company's debt exceeds the fair value of debt mainly due to the increase in interest rates partially offset by the conversion premium on the convertible senior notes due in May 2025. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at December 31, 2021 primarily relates to the conversion premium on the convertible senior notes due in May 2025 and the outstanding senior notes due in April 2030. Excluding the effect on the fair value of our convertible senior notes, a hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of our other debt of approximately $522 million and $401 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our convertible senior notes are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of our shares than changes in interest rates. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will likely increase as the market price of our shares increases and will likely decrease as the market price of our shares falls. Our businesses outside of the U.S. (see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) represent a substantial majority of our financial results, but because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our businesses outside of the U.S. are translated from local currencies (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currencies. For example, the U.S. Dollar strengthened in 2022 versus both the Euro and British Pound Sterling by 11% and 10%, respectively, as compared to 2021. Our total revenues increased by 56% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, but without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our total revenues increased year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 71%. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had a significant investment that was denominated in Hong Kong Dollars and the related impact from the movements in foreign currency exchange rates was recognized in ""Other income (expense), net"" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 5 to our Consolidated financial Statements.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our Euro denominated debt was $7.6 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. We designate certain portions of the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. The foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in ""Other income (expense), net"" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Notes 12 and 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the amount of net assets 57of the Euro functional currency subsidiaries, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.We generally enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instruments in the future. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our derivative contracts. We are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies. We recorded net losses of $963 million and $569 million and net gains of $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to these equity securities (see Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair value of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2.2 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. Our investments in private companies are measured at cost less impairment, if any. Such investments are also required to be measured at fair value as of the date of certain observable transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values at December 31, 2022 and 2021 of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies would have resulted in a loss, before tax, of approximately $220 million and $320 million, respectively, being recognized in net income.",2023-12-30 18:44:05.889811
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Factors That May Affect Future Results.” Overview General. We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of travel products, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation packages and cruises. Our unique Name Your Own Price® system — which allows our customers to make offers for travel products at prices they set — enables our customers to use the Internet to save money on travel products and services while enabling sellers, which include many of the major domestic airline, hotel and rental car companies, to generate incremental revenue. In 2003, we complemented our Name Your Own Price® product offering by giving our customers the ability to purchase certain travel products in a more traditional, price-disclosed manner. At present, we derive substantially all of our revenues from the following sources: • Transaction revenues from the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; • Reservation booking fees from Worldspan, L.P. in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; • Customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; • Processing fees, Worldspan reservation booking fees and travel commissions, principally related to the sale of price disclosed airline tickets, cruises and other travel services; and • Other revenues derived primarily from advertising on our websites and fees for referring customers to affiliates and others. Trends. Our overall financial prospects have been and continue to be significantly dependent upon our sale of leisure airline tickets and, as a result, the health of our business has been directly related to the health of the airline industry. While the domestic airline industry has experienced significant revenue declines since September of 2001, the online travel sector, overall, continues to grow, and we believe the opportunity exists for us to broaden our participation in that growth. Nonetheless, most domestic airlines, and many of our major suppliers, have experienced, and continue to experience, significant losses, which, in many cases, worsened as a result of the war in Iraq and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. In addition, these problems have been compounded by competition from low-cost carriers and uncertainty regarding our domestic economy. As a result, since September of 2001, many of the major airlines have grounded portions of their fleets, significantly reducing the number of available airline seats, and have deeply discounted retail airline tickets to stimulate demand. These actions have had, and continue to have, a detrimental effect on our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket business, which represents a significant portion of our total airline ticket revenues. Deep retail discounting by the airlines negatively affects demand for our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket product because it hurts our value proposition and makes users less willing to 37 accept the trade-offs associated with our product. In addition, decreased airline capacity hurts our business by reducing the levels of inventory available to us and increasing our cost of inventory. Customer offer prices have not kept pace with the increase in our cost of inventory and are, therefore, lower in proportion to our average cost of supply, which has, for the better part of the last two years, materially and negatively affected the number of Name Your Own Price® tickets we sell. In an effort to counter some of the trends described above, we have taken a number of initiatives to diversify our product offerings to lessen our reliance on the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Over the past two years, we have invested in and focused our marketing efforts on our non-airline travel products, including, in particular, our hotel business. We intend to continue to develop our non-air business, in particular our hotel, rental car and vacation package businesses, for which demand remains relatively strong, and continue to evaluate and implement ways to improve the number of airline tickets we sell. In addition, we have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify our revenue among non-opaque products, such as retail travel products, which we believe will help broaden our customer appeal. To this end, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we began offering customers the ability to purchase airline tickets at disclosed, retail prices. Our intent is to permit customer maximum flexibility by allowing them to select a retail itinerary or to make use of the Name Your Own Price® product. It is too early for us to determine the impact that the launch of a retail airline ticket product, or the related marketing effort, will have on our business results. However, the preliminary results have been positive and we believe we are starting to make progress towards stabilizing and growing total unit sales of airline tickets, which, as discussed above, declined significantly over the past two years. Based on these preliminary results, the launch of a retail airline product has had a positive effect on the overall number of airline tickets we sell. While some customers presented with a display of low disclosed prices may opt to select such a ticket or make a lower offer for an Name Your Own Price® ticket, we believe the gross profit contribution from the increased sale of retail airline tickets has, to date, more than offset any loss in the number of Name Your Own Price® tickets sold. Further terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East, the liquidation of a major domestic airline now in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or the withdrawal from our system of a major airline or hotel supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above. Other. A number of travel suppliers, particularly airlines, have indicated publicly that, as part of an effort to reduce distribution costs, they intend to reduce their dependence over time on what they view to be “expensive” distribution channels such as global distribution systems (GDSs). A number of travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that require rebates of all or part of the fees received from the GDS. Additionally, travel suppliers are encouraging distributors, such as us, to develop technology enabling direct connections therefore bypassing the GDS. Development of direct connection technology would require the use of information technology resources and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other projects. We have been and believe that we will continue to be under pressure from travel suppliers to rebate all or part of the travel booking fees we receive from Worldspan, L.P., our GDS. To the extent that we are required to rebate travel booking fees we currently receive from our GDS to travel suppliers, and are unable to recover such amounts by charging customers, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Factors That May Affect Future Results — We may lose or be subject to reduction of global distribution system fees.” We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our leisure travel business, to continue to promote the priceline.com brand and, over time, to offer other travel products and services on our website. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve 38 operating results. Our goal is to improve gross margins in an effort to achieve and maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve revenue growth and sustain profitability. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make significant judgments. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to credit card charge-backs and refunds, recoverability of our investments in licensees and other, recoverability and useful lives of intangible assets, income and other taxes, restructuring, special charges and severance, and contingencies and litigation. Those estimates are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is set forth below. • Refunds. In limited circumstances, we make certain accommodations for customers or provide refunds to customers. Based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with our suppliers, we establish reserves for estimated losses resulting from refunds or cancellations. In the event that we experience either an unanticipated increase in refunds or cancellations, as we did in the weeks following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or our suppliers refuse to accept certain refunds or cancellations or challenge refunds granted outside of their policies, our costs of revenues could increase. • Allowance for Credit Card Charge-backs. Because we act as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs. In the event we experience an unanticipated increase in fraudulent transactions on our website, our sales and marketing expense could increase. • Investment in Equity Interests. We have a 49% equity interest in pricelinemortgage and, accordingly, recognize our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage’s net income. The carrying value of the investment at December 31, 2003 was $9.4 million. Additionally, Lowestfare.com, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has an investment in Travelweb LLC that represents approximately 14% of its outstanding equity. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the investment in Travelweb LLC was $7.9 million. We periodically test these investments for impairment using a number of assumptions and estimates. In the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine that some part or all of the carrying value of either of these investments is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded. 39 • Derivative Financial Instruments. We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates on our Convertible Senior Notes. We use derivatives principally in the management of interest rate exposure. We do not utilize derivatives that contain leverage features. On the date on which we enter into a derivative, the derivative is designated as a hedge of the identified exposure and we measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis. In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we swapped the fixed 1% interest on our Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010 for a floating interest rate hedge based on the 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, minus the applicable margin of 221 basis points, on $45 million notional value of debt. We designated this interest rate swap agreement as a fair value hedge and therefore changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and the underlying debt are recorded as offsetting gains and losses in interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In the event that future interest rate relationships change significantly from those in effect today, the swap could become ineffective as a hedge vehicle causing us to record additional interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. • Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategy, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. While we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations. • Tax Valuation Allowance. We recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2003 and 2002 representing the portion of tax operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized. At December 31, 2003 we had approximately $3 billion of net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes expiring from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2021, which are subject to limitation on future utilization under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In the event that future operations indicate that some or all of these deferred tax benefits will be realized, we would recognize a tax provision credit for those estimated future tax benefits in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The recognition of some or all of such future tax benefits would involve a significant amount of judgment by management. In addition, the amount of annual benefit available under Section 382 is based upon certain conclusions pertaining to the dates of the ownership changes and the value of the Company on the dates of the ownership changes. The overall determination of the annual Section 382 limitation is subject to interpretation, and therefore, the annual loss limitation could be subject to change. • Presentation of Revenues. Revenues are primarily recognized, if and when, we accept and fulfill a customer’s offer. Merchant revenue, which represents a substantial majority of our overall revenues, primarily represents the selling price of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars. For these transactions, we establish the price we will accept, have discretion in supplier selection, purchase and take title to the particular product and are the merchant of record. We record as revenue the amount 40 received from the customer, net of taxes, surcharges and other fees. Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our products are determined by third parties. We record these fees as revenue, at the net amount we receive, with no associated cost of revenue. • Accounting for State and Local Taxes. We file tax returns in such states as required by law based on principles applicable to traditional businesses. In addition, we pay sales and other taxes to suppliers on our purchases of travel services sold through the priceline.com service. In certain cases, where appropriate, we remit taxes directly to the tax authorities. We believe that this practice is consistent with the tax laws of all jurisdictions. However, one or more states could seek to impose additional income tax obligations, sales tax collection obligations, or other tax obligations on companies, such as ours, which engage in or facilitate online commerce. A number of proposals have been made at state and local levels that could impose such taxes on the sale of products and services through the Internet or the income derived from such sales. To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have additional tax exposure. We will continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent appropriate, we will reserve for those estimates of liabilities. • Valuation of Goodwill. We account for goodwill in connection with our investment in priceline.com europe. We performed the initial and final steps of the transitional impairment test in 2002 in connection with our adoption of Statements of Financial Accounting No. 142. There was no impairment resulting from the transitional impairment test, however, subsequent changes in circumstances indicated that an impairment had occurred and impairment losses were determined and reflected in “operating loss” in our 2002 Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment testing performed during 2003 resulted in no impairment. We will periodically test goodwill for impairment using a number of assumptions and estimates. In the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine that some part or all of the goodwill is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded. Financial Presentation During the first quarter of 2003, we enhanced our financial reporting format. In the past, we reported revenue segmented between travel and other revenue, a format that was driven by our pursuit of businesses outside of the travel industry. With the repositioning of our long distance and new car products in the fourth quarter of 2002, our ongoing plan to keep our strategic focus on the online travel sector and our recent commitment to compliment our core Name Your Own Price® products by developing agency-based retail travel products, the decision was made to provide revenue and gross profit reporting in three categories: Merchant (encompassing substantially all of our Name Your Own Price® travel services), Agency (encompassing substantially all of our priced-disclosed retail services) and Other (encompassing all remaining revenue, the largest component of which is advertising revenue). In the third quarter 2003, we further enhanced our financial reporting format by adding two additional operating expense line items, Personnel and Information Technology. We believe that the addition of these line items, as well as the discontinuance of the Systems and Business Development category, is more useful to readers of our financial statements. These reclassifications have been made to prior years’ financial statements to conform to current year presentation. Starting with the fourth quarter 2003, we began reporting our metrics in a new format that provides greater visibility into the operations of our retail businesses. We now combine merchant and agency unit bookings for air, hotel and rental car services. The format change reflects the increased importance of agency unit sales to our operating results and gives a better view into the full 41 scale of our operating activities. In connection with this change in format, we stopped presenting “bind rate” and other related customer metrics since we believe such data, which reflects sales of opaque products only, no longer presents a complete view of our financial results or business trends. We continue to present 2002 and 2001 comparative data in the previous format, as we believe such data was relevant in those periods. In June 2003, our stockholders approved a one-for-six reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split was effected at 12:01 a.m. on June 16, 2003, and, as a result, our issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from approximately 227.6 million to approximately 37.9 million shares. The par value of the common stock was not affected by the reverse stock split and remains at $0.008 per share. Consequently, on our balance sheet, the aggregate par value of the issued common stock was reduced by reclassifying the par value amount of the eliminated shares of common stock to Additional Paid-in Capital. All per share amounts and outstanding shares, including all common stock equivalents, have been retroactively restated in the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2003 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Revenues Revenues are derived substantially from the following sources: • Transaction revenues from the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; • Reservation booking fees from Worldspan, L.P. in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; • Customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; • Travel commissions, customer processing fees and Worldspan reservation booking fees, principally related to the sale of price disclosed airline tickets, cruises and other travel services; and • Other revenues derived primarily from advertising on our websites and fees for referring customers to affiliates and others. We classify our revenue into three categories: • Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and determine the price to be paid by the customer. Merchant revenues include the selling price of the airline ticket, hotel room and rental car and are reported on a gross basis. • Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our products are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and Worldspan reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. 42 • Other revenues derived primarily from advertising on our websites and fees we earn for referring customers to pricelinemortgage for home financing services and from AIG for travel related insurance. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we experienced a decrease in total revenue of approximately $140 million primarily due to a decline in the sale of merchant airline tickets, partially offset by the improved performance of our hotel and rental car products. Additionally, we have experienced a shift in our airline ticket business mix from a primarily merchant opaque model to include a growing number of retail, price disclosed tickets. Because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis, revenues could decrease and gross profit will become an increasing important measure of evaluating growth in our business. The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold were as follows: Year Ended Airline Tickets Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days December 31, 2003 1.8 million 5.7 million 3.7 million December 31, 2002 2.9 million 4.1 million 2.9 million Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of: (1) merchant revenues; (2) agency revenues; and (3) other revenues. Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Merchant Revenues $ 852,454 $ 996,112 (14.4 )% Agency Revenues 7,554 720 949.2 % Other Revenues 3,653 6,774 (46.1 )% Total Revenues $ 863,661 $ 1,003,606 (13.9 )% Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and determine the price to be paid by the customer. Merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of: (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; (2) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and (3) ancillary fees, including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees for merchant transactions only. The approximately $144 million decrease in merchant revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 was primarily attributable to the decrease in the number of Name Your Own Price® tickets sold, which was partially offset by the improved performance of our Name Your Own Price® hotel and rental car products. We believe that the decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets sold – and the corresponding effect that decrease had on our overall merchant revenues during the twelve months ended 43 December 31, 2003 – continued to be due primarily to the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade­offs associated with our Name Your Own Price® airline product in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates to purchase travel products at the lower retail rates or from “low-cost” carriers without having to make any trade-offs. In addition, many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and upon the outbreak of war in Iraq and the outbreak of SARS, thus decreasing capacity on existing flights, which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us. In addition, in the past, we have “subsidized” certain Name Your Own Price® offers to purchase merchant airline tickets by adding a variable amount to some customers’ offers to increase the likelihood that such customers’ offers would be successful. These “subsidies” had the effect of, among other things, increasing the number of merchant airline tickets sold and our merchant revenues but at the expense of lower gross margins. At the end of 2002, we made the strategic decision to reduce sales of subsidized airline tickets. To this end, we reduced subsidies we have historically applied to certain merchant airline ticket offers. While this has had the effect of reducing the number of merchant airline tickets sold and our revenue during 2003, it has positively contributed to our gross profit and gross margin. The year-over-year decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets sold, and the corresponding effect it had on our merchant revenue, was partially offset by the increase in hotel room nights and rental car days sold in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. We believe that the increase in hotel room night sold during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same periods in 2002 was principally driven by our emphasis on our hotel business, and specifically by the success of our advertising campaign focused on our hotel product, and the competitive room inventory and pricing we receive from our hotel partners. We believe the increase in rental car days sold during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same periods in 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our rental car product, which we believe was driven by, among other things, an increase in visits to our website as a result of our advertising, and an overall increase in demand for leisure rental cars generally, improvements we made to the presentation of our rental car product on our website and improvement in the inventory and pricing we receive from our rental car partners. Agency Revenues Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our products are determined by third parties. Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of: (1) processing fees and third-party supplier commissions related to the sale of travel products including the sale of price disclosed airline tickets, cruises and other travel services; and (2) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to price-disclosed transactions. Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased approximately 949% from the same period a year ago, primarily as a result of our increased focus on the retail airline ticket and rental car business and the resulting increase in travel commissions and processing fees earned. Other Revenues Other revenues during twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage for home financing services and to AIG for travel insurance and in 2002 automobile services; (3) in 2002, transaction revenue from our long distance phone service, which we repositioned in 2002; and (4) in 2002, license fees from Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Other revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 decreased approximately 46% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, primarily as a result of the decrease in fees earned from our home financing service, and due to our repositioning of our long distance phone service. 44 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 200-2 Cost of Merchant Revenues $ 717,716 $ 844,142 (15.0 )% % of Merchant Revenues 84.2 % 84.7 % Cost of Agency Revenues $ — $ — — % of Agency Revenues — — Cost of Other Revenues $ — $ 1,098 (100.0 )% % of Other Revenues — 16.2 % Total Cost of Revenues $ 717,716 $ 845,240 (15.1 )% % of Revenues 83.1 % 84.2 % Cost of Revenues Cost of Merchant Revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (2) the cost of hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of hotel occupancy tax; and (3) the cost of rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes. Cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, decreased approximately 15%, primarily due to a decrease in sales of merchant airline tickets, as discussed above. Cost of Agency Revenues. Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any. 45 Cost of Other Revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, cost of other revenues consisted of the cost of long distance telephone service provided by our suppliers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, there were no such costs due to the repositioning of our long distance telephone service in the fourth quarter of 2002. Gross Profit. Total gross profit decreased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, by $12.4 million primarily as a result of the decrease in sales of merchant airline tickets, described above. Partially offsetting the reduction in total gross profit was growth in merchant hotel and rental car gross profit as well as an increase in agency gross profit. Total gross profit, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, increased during the period ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same period during 2002 as a result of an ongoing shift in our business mix from primarily merchant opaque transactions, reported on a gross basis, to include more retail agency transactions, recorded on a net basis. Because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis, gross profit will become an increasing important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Merchant Gross Profit $ 134,738 $ 151,970 (11.3 )% Merchant Gross Margin 15.8 % 15.3 % Agency Gross Profit $ 7,554 $ 720 949.2 % Agency Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Other Gross Profit $ 3,653 $ 5,676 (35.6 )% Other Gross Margin 100.0 % 83.8 % Total Gross Profit $ 145,945 $ 158,366 (7.8 )% Total Gross Margin 16.9 % 15.8 % The following table represents the percentage of gross profit, by category, in relation to total gross profit: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Year Ended December 31, 2002 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Merchant gross profit 94.3 % 93.5 % 93.0 % 87.9 % 95.6 % 97.0 % 95.4 % 95.5 % Agency gross profit 3.1 % 3.7 % 4.6 % 10.0 % 0.5 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % Other gross profit 2.6 % 2.8 % 2.4 % 2.1 % 3.9 % 2.6 % 4.2 % 4.1 % Merchant Gross Profit. Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, merchant gross profit decreased from the same period in 2002, primarily due to the continued weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us, factors which are described in “Merchant Revenues,” above, in more detail. As discussed in “Merchant Revenues” above, at the end of 2002, we strategically reduced subsidies applied to certain Name Your Own Price® airline ticket sales. While this resulted in a reduction 46 in merchant revenues, the subsidy reduction positively affected our gross profit and increased our gross margin. We are able to manage the level of gross margins by controlling the price at which we will cause offers to be fulfilled. Our merchant gross margin in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased over the same periods a year ago primarily as the result of a shift in mix of our products from the sale of airline tickets to the sale of hotel room nights and rental car days. Agency Gross Profit. Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which is recorded net of agency costs, if any. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2002 due to an increase in the sale of disclosed price airline tickets, rental cars and related fees and commissions. Other Gross Profit. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, other gross profit decreased over the same period in 2002 as a result of decreases in fees earned in connection with our long distance phone service and home financing services and decrease in license fees from Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Advertising $ 42,248 $ 44,664 (5.4 )% % of Total Gross Profit 28.9 % 28.2 % Advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and radio advertising; (2) online and e-mail advertisements; and (3) agency fees, creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, advertising expenses decreased over the same periods in 2002 primarily due to a shift from primarily radio advertising to lower absolute dollars spent on television advertising and partially offset by an increase in production and creative talent fees. We intend to continue to promote the priceline.com brand aggressively in the first quarter 2004 and to devote our marketing resources to the re-launch of our airline ticket product, as well as the continued support of our hotel product. We expect to spend approximately $13 million to $15 million on advertising in the first quarter 2004. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Sales and Marketing $ 26,803 $ 32,699 (18.0 )% % of Total Gross Profit 18.4 % 20.6 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions for credit card charge-backs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, sales and marketing expenses, which are variable in nature, decreased over the same periods in 2002 due to less 47 customer transaction processed in which we acted as the merchant of record and the realization of higher cost efficiencies in our call centers, partially offset by an increase in credit card chargebacks. Personnel Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Personnel $ 29,680 $ 32,045 (7.4 )% % of Total Gross Profit 20.3 % 20.2 % Personnel expenses consist primarily of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes and employee health benefits. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, personnel expenses decreased over the same periods in 2002 due to the full-year effect of a reduction in headcount undertaken during our fourth quarter 2002 restructuring, partially offset by an increase in employee bonus expense. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 General and Administrative $ 12,031 $ 13,298 (9.5 )% Stock Based Compensation 282 1,000 (71.8 )% Total $ 12,313 $ 14,298 (13.9 )% % of Total Gross Profit 8.4 % 9.0 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) business insurance; (2) fees for outside professionals; (3) occupancy expenses; and (4) telecommunications costs. General and administrative expenses decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the same periods in 2002 as a result of decreases in employment agency fees, taxes and stock based compensation, partially offset by higher professional fees and premiums on our Directors and Officers liability insurance policies. General and administrative expenses were also impacted by the favorable resolution of certain obligations, without which the year-over-year reduction would have been approximately 5%. 48 Information Technology Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Information Technology $ 8,898 $ 12,008 (25.9 )% % of Total Gross Profit 6.1 % 7.6 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet site; and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, information technology expenses decreased over the same period in 2002 primarily as a result of cost efficiencies generated by cost savings initiatives, additional capitalized development costs associated with the launch of our retail products. In addition, Information Technology expenses were reduced by the favorable settlement of certain vendor disputes related to data communications and telecom expenses without which the year-over-year reduction would have been approximately 23%. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Depreciation and Amortization $ 11,533 $ 18,264 (36.9 )% % of Total Gross Profit 7.9 % 11.5 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (2) depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of our leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and (4) amortization of our intangible assets with determinable lives. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and amortization expense decreased over the same periods in 2002, primarily as a result of a smaller depreciable asset base and a reduction in capital expenditures in 2003. Restructuring, Severance, and Special Charges In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $564,000. This restructuring charge resulted from a re-evaluation and refinement of our estimated real estate costs related to leased property vacated in connection with the 2002 and 2000 restructurings. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $4.7 million. This restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel businesses and a reduction in headcount. The repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel business. The charge relates primarily to severance payments, real estate costs and asset impairments. As a result of the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring, our work force was reduced by 59 full-time employees at our Norwalk location and 4 full-time employees at our Europe location. The employee 49 termination costs primarily represent severance payments and related benefits. The real estate costs primarily represent the estimated net lease expense related to space we decided we no longer needed, and which we will not utilize in the future along with certain required refurbishments to that space. Asset impairments are comprised of abandoned equipment and software projects, and software costs related to our plans not to pursue certain product offerings and activities. Other restructuring charges include professional and other fees and costs incurred in 2002 associated with the restructuring activities. In the second quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors announced that Richard S. Braddock had been reappointed as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Braddock replaced Daniel H. Schulman, our prior President and Chief Executive Officer. In connection with Mr. Schulman’s separation, we recorded a severance charge of $5.4 million in the second quarter of 2001. This severance charge resulted from the forgiveness of outstanding loans to Mr. Schulman and the payment of severance, all of which was required by the terms of Mr. Schulman’s employment agreement. We also accelerated, pursuant to the terms of Mr. Schulman’s employment agreement, the vesting of 2,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and 1,000,000 shares underlying stock options granted to Mr. Schulman, resulting in a charge of approximately $770,000. The balance due to Mr. Schulman ($345,000) was paid in the second quarter 2002. In the first quarter of 2001, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $1.4 million. This restructuring charge related primarily to the reduction of our workforce by approximately 25 full-time employees in February 2001. The charge relates primarily to severance payments and the entire amount of the charge was disbursed in 2001. The components and the annual activity related to the restructuring charges for the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, were as follows (in thousands): Employee Termination Costs Real Estate Costs Asset Impairments Other Total Accrued at 1/1/2001 $ 2,640 $ 9,286 $ 956 $ 588 $ 13,470 Charged in 2001 1,400 — — — 1,400 Paid in 2001 (3,358 ) (3,155 ) (835 ) (320 ) (7,668 ) Adjustments (311 ) (1,036 ) (114 ) (75 ) (1,536 ) Accrued at 12/31/2001 371 5,095 7 193 5,666 Charged in 2002 2,416 398 1,064 776 4,654 Currency translation adjustment 3 2 11 10 26 Non-cash charges (5 ) — (1,075 ) — (1,080 ) Paid in 2002 (1,114 ) (2,161 ) — (2 ) (3,277 ) Adjustments (10 ) (824 ) (7 ) (75 ) (916 ) Accrued at 12/31/2002 $ 1,661 $ 2,510 $ — $ 902 $ 5,073 Charged in 2003 — 564 — — 564 Currency translation adjustment (5 ) (18 ) — 73 50 Paid in 2003 (1,499 ) (1,631 ) — (249 ) (3,379 ) Adjustments (64 ) (306 ) — (383 ) (753 ) Accrued at 12/31/2003 $ 93 $ 1,119 — $ 343 $ 1,555 50 During 2003 and 2002, we decreased the liability for the restructuring charge by approximately $753,000 and approximately $916,000, respectively. These reductions resulted from the favorable resolution of certain matters, primarily the collection of certain receivables and the settlement of real estate commitments, and were reflected as an adjustment to the “Restructuring charge (reversal)” line on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We estimate, based on current available information, the remaining net cash outflows associated with our restructuring related commitments will be as follows (in thousands): Expected to be Paid in 2004 2005 Employee termination costs $ 93 $ — Real estate costs 587 532 Other 343 — Total: $ 1,023 $ 532 Restructuring related liabilities due within 12 months and due after 12 months are classified in “Accrued expenses” and in “Other long-term liabilities”, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Impairment Charge During the third quarter of 2002, we performed impairment tests and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill of $22.5 million related to our European operations exceeded its implied fair value by approximately $12 million and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of $12 million. The fair value was determined using generally accepted valuation techniques including the market value of comparable companies (including revenue multiple methodology) and discounted cash flow. Underlying the impairment was a continued decline in the market value of priceline.com’s common stock, which we review quarterly as an indicator of possible impairment of priceline.com europe Ltd.’s carrying value, a deterioration in priceline.com europe Ltd.’s operations caused primarily by increasingly competitive conditions among European online travel companies and a decision in the third quarter of 2002 to reconfigure product offerings. During the third quarter of 2002 we performed a periodic evaluation of the progress of the operations of Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Factors including increasing negative variances in key operating metrics such as negative gross margins and continuing operating losses, negative net asset position and an increasingly competitive operating environment led us to determine that the carrying 51 value of our convertible note no longer reflected its fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $12.2 million. Estimated fair value was determined using cash flow estimates and a review of the market value of comparable companies including the consideration of the decline in our market value and through discussion with third party valuation specialists. Warrant Charge Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Warrant charge $ 6,638 — — % of Total Gross Profit 4.5 % — — The warrant charge for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, related to the issuance of warrants to purchase priceline.com common stock to Marriott International, Inc. Interest Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Interest Income $ 2,474 $ 2,911 (15.0 )% Interest Expense (907 ) (68 ) 1,233.8 % Total $ 1,567 $ 2,843 (44.9 )% For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, interest income on cash and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2002 due to lower interest rates. Interest income was also partially offset by interest expense, including amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of our $125 million aggregate principal amount Convertible Senior Notes. Interest on the notes is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Equity in Income of Investees, net Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2003 2002 Equity in Income of Investees, net $ 2,331 $ 1,131 106.1 % Equity in income of investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 of $2.3 million, represented our pro rata share of the net income of pricelinemortgage and, in 2003, our pro rata share of the net loss of Travelweb, LLC. 52 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2002 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001. Revenues Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Merchant Revenues $ 996,112 $ 1,160,970 (14.2 )% Agency Revenues 720 590 22.0 % Other Revenues 6,774 10,193 (33.5 )% Total Revenues $ 1,003,606 $ 1,171,753 (14.4 )% Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of: (1) merchant revenues; (2) agency revenues; and (3) other revenues. Merchant Revenues. Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and determine the price to be paid by the customer. Merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of: (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; (2) ancillary fees, including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees for merchant transactions only; and (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we sold approximately 2.9 million, 4.1 million and 2.8 million airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, we sold approximately 4.5 million, 2.8 million and 3.1 million airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days, respectively. We believe that the approximately 36% decrease in the number of airline tickets sold in the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 was due primarily to the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade­off associated with our products in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel products at the lower retail rates or from low-cost carriers without having to make any trade-offs. In addition, many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, thus decreasing capacity on existing flights, which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us. Our “bind” rate is the percentage of unique offers that we ultimately fulfill. Our “bind rate” for all unique airline ticket, hotel room and rental car offers were as follows: Year Ended Airline Tickets Hotel Rooms Rental Cars December 31, 2002 37.1 % 61.5 % 45.7 % December 31, 2001 50.9 % 61.7 % 50.0 % 53 We believe that our merchant revenues and bind rate have been negatively impacted by the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade­off associated with our products in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel products at the lower retail rates or from low-cost carriers without having to make any trade-offs. In addition, many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, thus decreasing capacity on existing flights, which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us. These trends, which negatively impacted our revenues and bind rate in the fourth quarter of 2001, and throughout 2002. We added approximately 3.4 million new customers during the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, compared to approximately 3.7 million during 2001. In addition, we generated approximately 6.6 million repeat customer offers during the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, compared to approximately 5.9 million for the same period last year. Merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 decreased approximately 14% to $996 million from approximately $1.2 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, primarily as a result of the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade­off associated with our products in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel products at the lower retail rates or from low-cost carriers without having to make any trade-offs. In addition, many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, thus decreasing capacity on existing flights, which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us. Ancillary fee revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 decreased from the same period a year ago as a result of a decrease in Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees and customer processing fees in the airline and rental car services. The average revenue per total booked travel offer decreased 5.8% to $224 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 from $238 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2001. We believe that this decline in the average revenue per total booked travel offer was primarily driven by a change in the mix of our travel services sold. Specifically, revenues from our hotel and rental car businesses, which, on average, have a lower transaction value, grew as a percentage of total travel revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001. Merchant revenues, particularly airline tickets, continue to account for the majority of our revenue. Seasonal variations in our travel business have historically and are expected to continue to impact our travel revenues. The following table represents the percentage of total merchant revenue by quarter: Year Ended December 31, 2002 Year Ended December 31, 2001 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Merchant revenue 26 % 30 % 24 % 20 % 23 % 31 % 26 % 20 % Agency Revenues. Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our products are determined by third parties. Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of: (1) processing fees and third-party supplier commissions related to the sale of travel products including the sale of price 54 disclosed airline tickets, cruises and other travel services; and (2) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to price-disclosed transactions. Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 increased approximately 22% from the same period a year ago, primarily as a result of our increased focus on the retail airline ticket business and the resulting increase in travel commissions earned. Other Revenues. Other revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; (2) fees from our home financing and automobile services; (3) transaction revenue from our long distance phone service, which we repositioned in 2002; and (4) in 2002, license fees from Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Other revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 decreased approximately 34% to $6.8 million from $10.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues from our long distance phone service. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Cost of Merchant Revenues $844,142 $976,035 (13.5 )% % of Merchant Revenues 84.7 % 84.1 % Cost of Agency Revenues — — — % of Agency Revenues — — — Cost of Other Revenues $1,098 $2,812 (61.0 )% % of Other Revenues 16.2 % 27.6 % Total Cost of Revenues $845,240 $978,847 (13.6 )% % of Revenues 84.2 % 83.5 % Cost of Revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (2) the cost of hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of hotel occupancy tax; and (3) the cost of rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes. Cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, decreased primarily due to a decrease in sales of airline tickets. Cost of Agency Revenues. Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any. Cost of Other Revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, cost of other revenues consisted of the cost of long distance telephone service provided by our suppliers and decreased as a result of lower fees earned from our long distance phone service. 55 Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Merchant Gross Profit $ 151,970 $ 184,935 (17.8 )% Merchant Gross Margin 15.3 % 15.9 % Agency Gross Profit $ 720 $ 590 22.0 % Agency Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Other Gross Profit $ 5,676 $ 7,381 (23.1 )% Other Gross Margin 83.8 % 72.4 % Total Gross Profit $ 158,366 $ 192,906 (17.9 )% Total Gross Margin 15.8 % 16.5 % Merchant Gross Profit. Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of travel revenues. We are able to manage the level of gross margins by controlling the price at which we will cause offers to be fulfilled. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, merchant gross profit and related merchant gross margin decreased from the same period in 2001, primarily due to the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade­off associated with our products in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel products at the lower retail rates or from low-cost carriers without having to make any trade-offs. In addition, many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, thus decreasing capacity on existing flights, which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us. Agency Gross Profit. Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which is recorded net of agency costs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2001 due to an increase in agency revenues. Other Gross Profit. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, other gross profit decreased over the same period in 2001 as a result of the decrease in fees earned in connection with our long distance phone service. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Advertising $ 44,664 $ 46,874 (4.7 )% % of Total Gross Profit 28.2 % 24.3 % 56 Advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and radio advertising; (2) online and e-mail advertisements; and (3) agency fees, creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, advertising expenses decreased over the same period in 2001 primarily due to the decrease in television advertising, which was partially offset by an increase in online and radio advertising. In the first half of 2002, we shifted some of our marketing resources from traditional areas of marketing such as television and radio, toward lower cost online marketing and in the latter half of 2002, we began to focus again on television and radio advertising. During 2002, advertising expenses benefited from the resolution of certain agency obligations, offset entirely by additional advertising expenditures. The net result of these items did not have a material impact on either the total advertising expense or the total operating results. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Sales & Marketing $ 32,699 $ 63,611 (48.6 )% % of Total Gross Profit 20.6 % 33.0 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions for credit card charge-backs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, sales and marketing expenses decreased over the same period in 2001 due to a reduction in the absolute amount of credit card charge-backs and a related $1 million decrease in the allowance for charge-backs, as well as a reduction in variable expenses driven by lower unit volume. Personnel Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Personnel $ 32,045 $ 30,303 5.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 20.2 % 15.7 % Personnel expenses consist primarily of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes and employee health benefits. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, personnel expenses increased over the same periods in 2001, primarily due to a decrease in shared personnel charges relating to our European and Asian operations, which is a reduction of personnel expenses. 57 General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2002 2001 Change General & Administrative $ 13,298 $ 16,384 (18.8 )% Stock Based Compensation 1,000 16,508 (93.9 )% Total $ 14,298 $ 32,892 (56.5 )% % of Total Gross Profit 9.0% 17.1% General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) business insurance; (2) occupancy expenses; (3) telecommunications costs; and (4) fees for outside professionals. General and administrative expenses decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 over the same period in 2001 primarily as a result of a decrease in professional fees and telecom expenses, offset by an increase in premiums on our Directors and Officers liability insurance policy. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we recorded charges of approximately $120,000 for payroll taxes relating to options exercised in accordance with our employee stock option plans. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, payroll taxes relating to the exercise of employee stock options were $909,000. Stock based compensation decreased over the same period in 2001 as a result of the completion of the amortization of restricted stock. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we accelerated the vesting of restricted stock held by certain employees based on the anticipated achievements of earnings performance targets established at the time of grant (fourth quarter of 2000). As a result of the acceleration of the vesting of the restricted stock, we recorded a charge of approximately $3.3 million in the fourth quarter 2001. In addition, in connection with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock, we paid the tax withholding liability associated with the vesting of such shares, including amounts in excess of the minimum statutory tax withholding, by withholding from delivery to certain employees shares of stock and, as a result, recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $3.1 million. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Information Technology $ 12,008 $ 12,477 (3.8)% % of Total Gross Profit 7.6% 6.5% Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet site; and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, information technology expenses decreased slightly from the same as the same period in 2001. During 2002, information technology expenses were impacted by the favorable resolution of certain data center, 58 telecom and contract programming obligations. In the absence of such adjustments information technology expenses would have been approximately 2% higher than the amount recorded during 2001. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Depreciation and Amortization $ 18,264 $ 16,578 10.2% % of Total Gross Profit 11.5% 8.6% Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (2) depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of our leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and (4) amortization of our intangible assets with determinable lives. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, depreciation and amortization expense increased over the same periods in 2001, primarily as a result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2002. Restructuring, Severance, and Special Charges In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $4.7 million. This restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel businesses and a reduction in headcount. The repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel business. The charge relates primarily to severance payments, real estate costs and asset impairments. As a result of the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring, our work force was reduced by 59 full-time employees at our Norwalk location and 4 full-time employees at our Europe location. The employee termination costs primarily represent severance payments and related benefits. The real estate costs primarily represent the estimated net lease expense related to space we decided we no longer needed, and which we will not utilize in the future along with certain required refurbishments to that space. Asset impairments are comprised of abandoned equipment and software projects, and software costs related to our plans not to pursue certain product offerings and activities. Other restructuring charges include professional and other fees and costs incurred in 2002 associated with the restructuring activities. In the second quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors announced that Richard S. Braddock had been reappointed as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Braddock replaced Daniel H. Schulman, our prior President and Chief Executive Officer. In connection with Mr. Schulman’s separation, we recorded a severance charge of $5.4 million in the second quarter of 2001. This severance charge resulted from the forgiveness of outstanding loans to Mr. Schulman and the payment of severance, all of which was required by the terms of Mr. Schulman’s employment agreement. We also accelerated, pursuant to the terms of Mr. Schulman’s employment agreement, the vesting of 2,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and 1,000,000 shares underlying stock options granted to Mr. Schulman, resulting in a charge of approximately $770,000. The balance due to Mr. Schulman ($345,000) was paid in the second quarter 2002. In the first quarter of 2001, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $1.4 million. This restructuring charge related primarily to the reduction of our workforce by approximately 25 full-time employees in February 2001. The charge relates primarily to severance payments and the entire amount of the charge was disbursed in 2001. 59 During 2002 and 2001, we decreased the liability for the restructuring charge and special charge by approximately $2.3 million and approximately $2.8 million, respectively. These reductions resulted from the favorable resolution of certain matters, primarily the collection of certain receivables, the settlement of real estate commitments and the settlement of certain liabilities, and were reflected as an adjustment to the “Restructuring charge (reversal)” and “Special charge (reversal)” line items on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Impairment Charge During the third quarter of 2002, we performed impairment tests and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill of $22.5 million related to our European licensee exceeded its implied fair value by approximately $12 million and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of $12 million. The fair value was determined using generally accepted valuation techniques including the market value of comparable companies (including revenue multiple methodology) and discounted cash flow. Underlying the impairment was a continued decline in the market value of priceline.com’s common stock, which we review quarterly as an indicator of possible impairment of priceline.com europe Ltd.’s carrying value, a deterioration in priceline.com europe Ltd.’s operations caused primarily by increasingly competitive conditions among European online travel companies and a decision in the third quarter of 2002 to reconfigure product offerings. During the third quarter of 2002 we performed a periodic evaluation of the progress of the operations of Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Factors including increasing negative variances in key operating metrics such as negative gross margins and continuing operating losses, negative net asset position and an increasingly competitive operating environment led us to determine that the carrying value of our convertible note no longer reflected its fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $12.2 million. Estimated fair value was determined using cash flow estimates and a review of the market value of comparable companies including the consideration of the decline in our market value and through discussion with third party valuation specialists. Interest Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Interest Income $ 2,911 $ 7,112 (59.1 )% Interest Expense (68 ) (116 ) 41.4 % Total $ 2,843 $ 6,996 (59.4 )% For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, interest income on cash and marketable securities decreased primarily due to a lower cash balance and lower interest rates. 60 Equity in Income of Investees, net Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2002 2001 Equity in Income of Investees, net $ 1,131 $ 551 105.3% Equity in net income of Investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 of $1.1 million and $551,000, respectively, represents our pro rata share of net income from our 49% equity investment in pricelinemortgage. We recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 (which is included in the “Equity in income of investees, net line of our Statement of Operations) to reflect the write-down of our investment in pricelinemortgage to its estimated fair value. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $268.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. Approximately $22.5 million is restricted cash collateralizing certain letters of credit issued in favor of certain suppliers and landlords. Also included in restricted cash are amounts held by our credit card processor company and interest rate swap counter-party. We generally invest excess cash to make such funds readily available for operating purposes. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of highly liquid, high quality, investment grade debt instruments, having maturities of less than two years. Because we collect cash up front from our customers and then pay our suppliers over a ten to fifteen day period, we tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter. This can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would indicate. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2003 was approximately $20.0 million, resulting from our net income of approximately $11.9 million, non-cash expenses of approximately $18.6 million, and changes in working capital that reduced operating cash flow by approximately $10.5 million. Non-cash items were primarily associated with the depreciation of property and equipment, and the Marriott warrant charge. The changes in working capital were primarily related to an approximately $13.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The decrease in accounts payable was related to our year-end supplier payables only being outstanding for 10 calendar days, as compared to 15 calendar days in 2002. The decrease was also attributable to cash payments related to our restructuring during the year, and a general decrease in expenses which resulted in lower trade accounts payable and accrued expense balances. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2002 was approximately $814,000, resulting from our net loss of approximately $19.2 million, offset by non-cash items of approximately $42.5 million and changes in working capital of approximately $22.5 million. Non-cash items were primarily associated with the impairment charge from our investments and the depreciation of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $112.7 million and approximately $24.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, Lowestfare.com, our wholly-owned subsidiary, made equity investments totaling approximately $14.2 million. In both years, net cash used in investing activities was partially related to purchases of property and equipment. Also affecting net cash used in investing activities in 2003 and 2002 was the investment 61 in short-term investments and marketable securities in the amount of approximately $87.3 million and approximately $14.9 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2003 were approximately $6.6 million. Capital expenditures for additions to property and equipment, is expected to aggregate approximately $6 to $10 million in 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $118.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This was primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of our Convertible Senior Notes, discussed in more detail below, and the proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. This amount was partially offset by the repurchase of our common stock. On July 31, 2002, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $40 million of common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. As part of the stock repurchase program, we purchased 690,000 and 897,953 shares, of our common stock for our treasury during the periods ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, at an aggregate cost of $12.2 million and $11.8 million, respectively. We may purchase additional shares of our common stock in the future. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This was primarily the result of our repurchase of our common stock discussed above, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. The following table represents the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003: Payments due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years After Five Years Operating lease obligations $ 18,169 $ 2,519 $ 4,939 $ 4,975 $ 5,736 Convertible debt 133,226 1,250 2,500 2,500 126,976 Total $ 151,395 $ 3,769 $ 7,439 $ 7,475 $ 132,712 Priceline.com leases certain property, primarily buildings in Norwalk, Connecticut, Columbus, Ohio and New York City. We also lease a small amount of office space in Staines, England. These leases are accounted for as operating leases. The operating lease obligations represent the minimum payments for our operating leases. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2003, we issued, in a private placement, $125 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an interest rate of 1%. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, strategic purposes and working capital requirements. The notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into our common stock, par value $0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price of approximately $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes will initially be convertible into 25 shares of our common stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period, as defined in the offering memorandum related to the notes, is more than 110% of the then current conversion price of the notes, or after August 1, 2008, the closing price of our common stock is more than 110% of the then current conversion price of the notes. The notes are also convertible in certain other circumstances set forth in the offering memorandum, such as a change in control of priceline.com. In addition, the notes will be redeemable at our option beginning in 2008, and the holders may require us to repurchase the notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other circumstances. Interest on the notes is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. 62 Excluded from the table above are letters of credit that were issued in favor of certain suppliers and landlords. The letters of credit expire between February of 2003 and April of 2004 and are generally subject to automatic renewal upon expiration of the letter of credit. Also excluded are employment agreements with certain members of senior management that provide for minimum annual compensation, upon termination of employment, of approximately $4 million. Our Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus an amount equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid, and is subject to mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007. In the event that we consummate certain business combination transactions, our Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company or the holder of our Series B Preferred Stock at the liquidation preference per outstanding share, plus all dividends accrued but not paid on the shares and all dividends that would have accrued through February 6, 2007. There were 13,470 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2003. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the rights and preferences of our Series B Preferred Stock. We believe that we will benefit in future years due to the significant amount of net operating loss carryforwards that we can utilize to offset future taxable income. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, for periods thereafter, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our projected financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue growth will be realized or that future borrowings or equity contributions will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures or finance our business plan. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments, including an interest rate hedge to manage market risks. Additional information regarding our interest rate hedge is contained within “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivative Financial Instruments” above. The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in interest rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates on a daily basis. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future interest rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future interest rate exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow 63 speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We determine the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our financial instruments based on a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates from the rates in effect as of the end of the year for these financial instruments. The only potential limitations of the respective models are in the assumptions utilized in the models such as the hypothetical adverse fluctuation rate and the discount rate. We believe that these models and the assumptions utilized are reasonable and sufficient to yield proper market risk disclosure. We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2003. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2003, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future. As of December 31, 2003, after adjusting for the effect of the interest rate swap agreement, we have fixed rate debt of approximately $125 million. The fair value of our debt was $103,275,000 at December 31, 2003. The potential fair value change resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse fluctuation in interest rates related to priceline’s outstanding fixed-rate debt would be approximately $626,000 as of December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, we held an interest rate swap agreement on $45 million notional value of our fixed rate debt. The fair value (cost if terminated) of this swap as of December 31, 2003 was approximately $537,000. A 10% adverse fluctuation in the 3-month LIBOR rate as of the end of the year would not decrease the interest rate swap’s fair value by a significant amount. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability, or cash flow. Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the cost of international airline tickets and international hotel reservations offered through the priceline.com service, and so may indirectly affect consumer demand for such products and priceline.com’s revenue. In the event of such weakness, such additional US Dollars would have reduced purchasing power. If the US Dollar weakens versus the British Pound Sterling, we may have to invest additional US Dollars in priceline.com europe Ltd. to fund its ongoing operations. Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate volatility. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by such changes.",2023-12-30 18:44:22.008189
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Factors That May Affect Future Results.” Overview General. We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation packages and cruises. We offer our customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase certain travel services in a traditional, price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique Name Your Own Price® service, which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at discounted prices. At present, we derive substantially all of our revenues from the following sources: • Transaction revenues from our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car services, as well as our vacation packages service; • Customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both Name Your Own Price® and price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars service; • Commissions primarily related to the sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, including those sold in Europe by our subsidiary Active Hotels, rental cars, cruises and other travel services; • Worldspan reservation booking fees related to both our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car service, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car service; • Transaction revenue from our price-disclosed hotel room service, facilitated principally through our wholly-owned subsidiary Travelweb LLC; and • Other revenues derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites. Trends. Our overall financial prospects have been and continue to be significantly dependent upon the sale of leisure airline tickets and, as a result, the health of our business has been directly related to the health of the airline industry. Most domestic airlines, and many of our major suppliers, have experienced, and continue to experience, significant losses. These losses have been compounded by competition from low-cost carriers and, most recently, by high fuel prices, which we believe increase the possibility of the additional bankruptcy and/or the liquidation of one or more of the major domestic airlines. As a result of these and other factors, many of the major airlines have deeply discounted retail airline tickets to maintain market share, simplified fare structures by removing restrictions associated with certain retail airline tickets and, as discussed in more detail in “Other” below, put pressure on third-party intermediaries like us to reduce airline distribution costs. These actions have had, and continue to have, a detrimental effect on our overall airline business and, in particular, our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket service, which represents a significant portion of our total airline ticket revenues. 43 Deep retail discounting by the airlines negatively affects demand for our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket service because it hurts our value proposition and makes users less willing to accept the trade-offs associated with our service for what has become, in many cases, modest fare savings. In addition, decreased airline capacity hurts our business by reducing the levels of inventory available to us and increasing our cost of inventory. Customer offer prices have not kept pace with the increase in our cost of inventory and are, therefore, lower in proportion to our average cost of supply, which has, for the better part of the last two years, materially and negatively affected the number of Name Your Own Price® tickets sold. In addition, in early 2005, several major airline carriers simplified their retail fare structures, which removed or reduced the restrictions placed on certain fares (for example, certain airlines, such as Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, eliminated certain “Saturday-night-stay” requirements and reduced certain cancellation/change fees) and reduced the prices of their most expensive fares. These fare restructurings negatively affected our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket service in the same manner as retail discounting — they hurt our value proposition and make users less willing to accept the trade-offs associated with our Name Your Own Price® service. Despite the trends associated with our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket service, the online travel sector, overall, continues to grow, and in the last two years, we have embarked on a strategy to more broadly participate in that growth by expanding our service offerings and markets. In an effort to participate in that growth and counter some of the trends described above, we have taken a number of initiatives to diversify our service offerings. We have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify our revenue among “non-opaque” services, such as by allowing our customers to purchase price disclosed retail airline, hotel and rental car travel services, which we believe will help broaden our customer appeal. To this end, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we began offering customers the ability to purchase airline tickets at disclosed, retail prices. We believe that the results of the launch of our retail airline ticket service, and the related marketing effort, have been positive and total unit sales of airline tickets increased in 2004 for the first time in two years. The launch of a retail airline service has also had a positive effect on gross profit contribution. While some customers presented with a display of low disclosed prices may opt to select such a ticket or make a lower offer for a Name Your Own Price® ticket, we believe the gross profit contribution from the increased sale of retail airline tickets has, to date, more than offset any loss in the number of Name Your Own Price® tickets sold. As part of our strategy to broaden the appeal of our hotel service and lessen our dependence on our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket service, we have invested in and focused our marketing efforts on our non-airline travel services, including, in particular, our hotel business. In 2004, Lowestfare.com, our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired all of the equity interest in Travelweb. We intend to use inventory from Travelweb to launch a price disclosed hotel service on the priceline.com site in the first half of 2005. Our intent is to provide customers maximum flexibility by allowing them to select a retail price disclosed itinerary or to make use of the Name Your Own Price® service. Additionally, in September 2004, we acquired Active Hotels. We believe the acquisition creates opportunities for us to expand our businesses. For example, Active Hotels has longstanding distribution relationships with a significant number of other European travel sites and we intend to support these relationships by providing access to U.S. travel services. In addition, we believe that we can offer Active Hotels’ services to our U.S. customer base for European travel. We also intend to continue to develop our other non-air business, in particular our rental car and vacation package businesses, for which demand remains relatively strong. In May 2004, we launched a new retail rental car search and booking engine on Rentalcars.com, and in June 2004, we implemented that functionality on Breezenet.com. In October 2004, we launched this search and booking engine on priceline.com to allow customers to choose between an opaque or a disclosed rental car offering. In addition, in the second quarter of 2004, we implemented a new feature on our vacation packages path that allows customers to choose between an “opaque” or a disclosed price flight itinerary. We currently offer 44 vacation package purchasers the opportunity to purchase tickets, transfers, tours, discounted restaurant meals and other services available at their travel destinations. We intend to expand this offering to other service paths. We sell advertising to travel suppliers and others on our owned websites, including www.priceline.com, www.lowestfare.com, www.travelweb.com, www.rentalcars.com, www.breezenet.com and www.mytravelguide.com, a travel information site acquired in 2004 and relaunched with upgraded content in early 2005. With respect to our mortgage service, which is offered on our website through a joint-venture and described above in Item 1. Business – Products and Services – Financial Services, interest rates have increased from recent lows, which has resulted in a slowdown in home refinancings and a reduction in the number of loans that pricelinemortgage.com originates. A reduction in loan originations negatively affects the results of pricelinemortgage.com and if this trend continues, our results attributable to pricelinemortgage.com could be significantly impacted. Further terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East or elsewhere, the liquidation of major domestic airlines now in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or the withdrawal from our system of a major airline or hotel supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above. Other. A number of travel suppliers, particularly airlines, have indicated publicly that, as part of an effort to reduce distribution costs, they intend to reduce their dependence over time on what they view to be “expensive” distribution channels such as global distribution systems (GDSs). A number of travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that require rebates of all or part of the fees received from the GDS. We have agreed to rebate certain GDS costs to certain suppliers in exchange for contractual considerations such as those relating to inventory pricing and availability, and expects to continue to do so in the future. Additionally, travel suppliers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to develop technology enabling direct connections to bypass the GDS. Development of direct connection technology would require the use of information technology resources and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other projects. We have been and believe that we will continue to be under significant pressure from travel suppliers, including most of the major domestic airlines and many of our significant hotel suppliers, to rebate all or part of the travel booking fees we receive from Worldspan, L.P., our GDS, and to significantly reduce or eliminate their distribution costs. To the extent that we are required to rebate travel booking fees we currently receive from our GDS to travel suppliers, and are unable to recover such amounts by charging customers, or, if one or a number of travel suppliers pull out of our service because they are unhappy with existing distribution costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our leisure travel business, to continue to promote the priceline.com brand and, over time, to offer other travel services on our website. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our 45 accounting policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies, as well as the estimates and judgments involved, is set forth below: • Refunds. In very limited circumstances, we make certain accommodations for customers or provide refunds to customers. Based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with our suppliers, we establish reserves for estimated losses resulting from these accommodations. In the event that we experience either an unanticipated increase in refunds or cancellations, as we did in the weeks following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or our suppliers refuse to accept certain refunds or cancellations or challenge refunds granted outside of their policies, our costs of revenues could increase. • Allowance for Credit Card Charge-backs. Because we act as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs. In the event we experience an unanticipated increase in fraudulent transactions on our website, our sales and marketing expense could increase. • Equity Investments. We have a 49% equity interest in pricelinemortgage.com and, accordingly, recognize our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net income. The carrying value of the investment at December 31, 2004 was $9.4 million. We periodically test this investment for impairment using a number of assumptions and estimates. In the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine that some part or all of the carrying value of pricelinemortgage.com is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded. • Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. While we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations. • Tax Valuation Allowance. A valuation allowance was recorded in the amount of $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2004 and 2003, representing the portion of tax operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized. At December 31, 2004 we had approximately $3 billion of net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes expiring from December 31, 46 2019 to December 31, 2021, which are subject to limitation on future utilization under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In the event that future operations indicate that some or all of these deferred tax benefits will be realized, we would recognize a tax provision credit for those estimated future tax benefits in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The recognition of some or all of such future tax benefits would involve a significant amount of judgment by management. In addition, the amount of annual benefit available under Section 382 is based upon certain conclusions pertaining to the dates of the ownership changes and the value of the Company on the dates of the ownership changes. The overall determination of the annual Section 382 limitation is subject to interpretation, and therefore, the annual loss limitation could be subject to change. • Merchant Revenues and Merchant Cost of Revenues Name Your Own Price® Services: Merchant revenues and related cost of revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and, among other things, select suppliers determine the price to be paid by the customer. We recognize such revenue and costs if and when we accept and fulfill the customer’s non-refundable offer. Merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include the selling price and cost, respectively, of the travel services and are reported on a gross basis. Pursuant to the terms of our hotel service, our hotel suppliers are permitted to bill us for the underlying cost of the service during a specified period of time. In the event that we are not billed by our hotel supplier within the specified time period, we reduce our cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts. In very limited circumstances, we make certain customer accommodations to satisfy disputes and complaints. We accrue for such estimated losses and classify the resulting expense as adjustments to merchant revenue and cost of merchant revenues or the allowance for doubtful accounts, as appropriate. Travelweb: Merchant revenues for Travelweb are derived from transactions where customers use the Travelweb service to purchase hotel rooms from hotel suppliers at rates which are subject to contractual arrangements. Charges are billed to customers at the time of booking and are included in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer completes his or her stay. Such amounts are generally refundable upon cancellation prior to stay, subject to cancellation penalties in certain cases. Merchant revenues and accounts payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at the conclusion of the customer’s stay at the hotel. Travelweb records the difference between the selling price and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue. • Agency Revenues and Cost of Revenues priceline.com: Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the products sold are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and Worldspan reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Such revenues are recognized when the travel transaction is completed on our website. Active Hotels: Active Hotels’ principal source of revenues comes from commission payments that it receives from hotel suppliers for acting as an agent in the booking of hotel rooms by customers. Active Hotels’ hotel suppliers are billed for their commission payments owed to Active Hotels and it recognizes agency revenue at the time that its’ customers complete their stay at the hotel. 47 • Accounting for State and Local Taxes. We file tax returns in such states as required by law based on principles applicable to traditional businesses. In addition, we pay sales and other taxes to suppliers on our purchases of travel services sold through the priceline.com service. In certain cases, where appropriate, we remit taxes directly to the tax authorities. We believe that this practice is consistent with the tax laws of all jurisdictions. However, one or more states could seek to impose additional income tax obligations, sales tax collection obligations, or other tax obligations on companies, such as ours, which engage in or facilitate online commerce. A number of proposals have been made at state and local levels that could impose such taxes on the sale of products and services through the Internet or the income derived from such sales. To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have additional tax exposure. We will continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent appropriate, we will reserve for those estimates of liabilities. • Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. We have recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets related to businesses we have acquired including Active Hotels, Travelweb and priceline.com europe Ltd. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine that some part or all of the goodwill is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded. Financial Presentation Starting with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, we began reporting “online advertising” and “offline advertising” instead of “advertising expense” on our Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations. We made this change because Travelweb and Active Hotels rely primarily on online advertising to drive their respective businesses, and our acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels have resulted in a large increase in our consolidated online advertising spending. We have added a discussion of the operating metric “Gross Bookings”, which represents the total dollar value, inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers. In addition, starting with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, we began combining (1) warrant costs with sales and marketing expenses, (2) stock compensation expense with personnel costs and (3) option taxes with general and administrative expenses, in order to better display the total cost of the associated activity. In June 2003, our stockholders approved a one-for-six reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split was effected on June 16, 2003, and, as a result, our issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from approximately 227.6 million to approximately 37.9 million shares. The par value of the common stock was not affected by the reverse stock split and remains at $0.008 per share. Consequently, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the aggregate par value of the issued common stock was reduced by reclassifying the par value amount of the eliminated shares of common stock to Additional Paid-in Capital. All per share amounts and outstanding shares, including all common stock equivalents, have been retroactively restated. 48 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2004 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Operating Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers. The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold were as follows: Year Ended Airline Tickets Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days Gross Bookings December 31, 2004 2.8 million 7.7 million 5.1 million $ 1,676.1 million December 31, 2003 1.8 million 5.7 million 3.7 million $ 1,101.3 million Airline tickets sold increased by 52.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003. The increase was driven entirely by the introduction of retail choice to our airline service. The growth in each period was partially offset by large annualized percentage decreases in sales of opaque airline tickets sold in each period. See “Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Trends” above. Hotel room nights sold increased by 35.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003. The increase was driven by (1) the continued success of our opaque hotel service, which benefited from continued direct advertising support and (2) the inclusion of hotel room nights sold by Travelweb and Active Hotels during the respective periods in 2004, subsequent to their acquisitions. Rental car days sold increased by 37.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due to increases in sales of our opaque rental car service through priceline.com and our retail rental car service through priceline.com, Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com. Gross Bookings increased by 52.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003. The increase was driven primarily by a 347.6% increase in agency bookings in 2004 as a result of (1) the introduction of retail choice to our airline service and (2) the inclusion of approximately $54 million of bookings from Active Hotels in our 2004 results. Gross bookings also increased as a result of an 8.0% increase in merchant bookings in 2004, as a result of (1) the continued success of our opaque hotel, rental car and vacation package services which offset significant annualized declines in bookings of our opaque airline ticket service; and (2) the inclusion of approximately $75 million of bookings from Travelweb in our 2004 results. Revenues We classify our revenue into three categories: 49 • Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our customers, remitting payments to our suppliers and establishes the price of the services we offer. Merchant revenues include (1) the selling price, as established by us, of the opaque airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and are reported on a gross basis; and (2) the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by a supplier, in connection with a Travelweb merchant hotel room. • Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and Worldspan reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. • Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites. We continue to experience a shift in our airline ticket business mix from a historically merchant opaque model to include a growing number of retail, price disclosed tickets. Because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis, airline ticket revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in merchant and retail sales mix and gross profit has become an important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Additionally, our acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels during the second and third quarters, respectively, contributed approximately $23.6 million to our revenues in 2004. Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Merchant Revenues $ 872,994 $ 852,454 2.4 % Agency Revenues 38,601 7,554 411.0 % Other Revenues 2,777 3,653 (24.0 )% Total Revenues $ 914,372 $ 863,661 5.9 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for twelve months ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of: (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the sale of hotel rooms on Travelweb; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and (4) ancillary fees, including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees related to Name Your Own Price® transactions only. The $20.5 million increase in merchant revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 was primarily attributable to continued growth in Name Your Own Price® hotels and our vacation package service, and the inclusion of approximately $15.5 million of revenues from Travelweb in 2004, subsequent to our acquisition of Travelweb, partially offset by (1) a substantial decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, and (2) decreased travel caused by the adverse weather in the Southeastern U.S. during the third quarter of 2004. We believe that the decrease in the number of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets sold – and the corresponding effect that decrease had on our overall merchant revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 – 50 continued to be due primarily to low retail airline ticket prices and the availability of retail tickets on our website. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the tradeoffs associated with our Name Your Own Price® airline service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel services at the lower retail rates, or from “low-cost” carriers without having to make any trade-offs. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 consisted primarily of: (1) processing fees and third-party supplier commissions related primarily to the sale of travel services including the sale of price-disclosed hotels, rental cars, cruises and other travel services; and (2) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to price-disclosed transactions. Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased from the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of (1) our increased focus on the retail airline ticket business, driven primarily by new advertising campaigns focused on our retail airline ticket and vacation packages service, (2) increased rental car business, including the impact of our acquisitions of Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com, and the resulting increase in travel commissions, GDS and processing fees earned, and (3) the inclusion of approximately $8 million of agency revenue from Active Hotels subsequent to our acquisition in September of 2004. Other Revenues Other revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services. Other revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 decreased compared to the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of lower financial services fees and reduced on-line advertising revenue. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Cost of Merchant Revenues $ 714,822 $ 717,716 (0.4 )% % of Merchant Revenues 81.9 % 84.2 % Cost of Agency Revenues 1,395 $ — % of Agency Revenues 3.6 % — — Cost of Other Revenues — $ — % of Other Revenues — — — Total Cost of Revenues $ 716,217 $ 717,716 (0.2 )% % of Revenues 78.3 % 83.1 % Cost of Revenues During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, cost of revenues decreased by approximately $1.5 million, over the same period in 2003, due primarily to a shift in the mix of revenue 51 generated by services that produce higher gross margins. Specifically, our opaque hotel service, which produces the highest gross margins of our four principal opaque offerings, represented a higher percentage of total opaque revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003. Conversely, our opaque airline service, which produces lower gross margins, declined significantly on a year-over-year basis, and therefore represented a substantially lower percentage of total opaque revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003. Cost of revenues grew at a slower rate than revenues because opaque transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in both periods as compared to retail transactions (principally Travelweb) that are recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues. Cost of Merchant Revenues For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of hotel occupancy tax, (2) the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (4) non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of Travelweb. Cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, decreased approximately 0.4% compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to the shift in the mix of revenue generated by services that generate different levels of gross margins, as discussed above. Cost of Agency Revenues Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of Active Hotels. Cost of Other Revenues For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no costs of other revenues. 52 Gross Profit Total gross profit increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, by approximately $52.2 million primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1) our opaque hotel and vacation package services; (2) increased sales of retail services; and (3) the inclusion of results from Travelweb and Active Hotels. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, compared to the same period in 2003, because opaque transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in both periods as compared to retail transactions which are recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because merchant transactions are reported gross and retail transactions (primarily Travelweb) are recorded on a net basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Merchant Gross Profit $ 158,172 $ 134,738 17.4 % Merchant Gross Margin 18.1 % 15.8 % Agency Gross Profit 37,206 7,554 392.5 % Agency Gross Margin 96.4 % 100.0 % Other Gross Profit 2,777 3,653 (24.0 )% Other Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Total Gross Profit $ 198,155 $ 145,945 35.8 % Total Gross Margin 21.7 % 16.9 % The following table represents the percentage of gross profit, by category, in relation to total gross profit: Year Ended December 31, 2004 Year Ended December 31, 2003 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Merchant gross profit 83.6 % 82.3 % 81.8 % 71.8 % 94.3 % 93.5 % 93.0 % 87.9 % Agency gross profit 14.9 % 16.3 % 16.7 % 27.1 % 3.1 % 3.7 % 4.6 % 10.0 % Other gross profit 1.5 % 1.4 % 1.5 % 1.1 % 2.6 % 2.8 % 2.4 % 2.1 % Merchant Gross Profit Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, merchant gross profit increased from the same period in 2003, primarily due to (1) increased revenue from Name Your Own Price® hotels and our vacation package service; (2) the inclusion of $12.3 million of gross profit from Travelweb; and (3) an increase in the percentage of our revenues represented by our opaque hotel, vacation packages and rental car services, which collectively have a higher gross margin than our opaque airline ticket service. Merchant gross 53 margin also increased because opaque transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in 2004, when compared to retail transactions (primarily Travelweb), which are recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues. Agency Gross Profit Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which is recorded net of agency costs, if any. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2003 due to an increase in the sale of disclosed price airline tickets, rental cars and related processing, GDS fees and travel commissions, and the inclusion of the results of Active Hotels subsequent to our acquisition. Other Gross Profit During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, other gross profit decreased from the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of lower pricelinemortgage.com referral fees and reduced on-line advertising revenues. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Offline Advertising $ 33,476 $ 25,125 33.2 % % of Total Gross Profit 16.9 % 17.2 % Online Advertising $ 27,480 $ 17,123 60.5 % % of Total Gross Profit 13.9 % 11.7 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and radio advertising; and (2) agency fees, creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, offline advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2003 primarily due to an increase in the frequency of television advertising associated with our new retail choice airline ticket service, continued advertising for our hotel service, creative talent and production costs for our new advertising campaign. Online advertising expenses consist primarily of banners, pop-ups, keyword searches, affiliate programs and e-mail advertisements. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, online advertising expenses increased over 2003 primarily due to the inclusion of the online advertising expenses of Travelweb and Active Hotels, which each rely primarily on online advertising to drive their respective businesses. We intend to continue to promote the priceline.com brand aggressively throughout 2005. 54 Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Sales and Marketing $ 32,091 $ 33,441 (0.4 )% % of Total Gross Profit 16.2 % 22.9 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; (3) provisions for credit card charge-backs; and (4) warrant costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The warrant charge related to the issuance of warrants to purchase priceline.com common stock to Marriott International, Inc. during the first quarter 2003. There was no similar charge during 2004. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, sales and marketing expenses decreased over the same period in 2003 due to the one-time nature of the charge associated with the issuance of the warrant in 2003. Excluding the effect of the warrant charge of $6.6 million in 2003, sales and marketing expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, were almost entirely variable in nature and therefore increased over the same period in 2003, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as the inclusion of sales and marketing expenses associated with Travelweb and Active Hotels. Personnel Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Personnel $ 35,574 $ 29,962 18.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 18.0 % 20.5 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, employee health benefits and stock based compensation. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2003 primarily due to additional salary expense resulting from the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels, as well as increases in performance-based employee bonuses. 55 General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change General and Administrative $ 16,452 $ 12,031 36.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 8.3 % 8.2 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals; (2) business insurance; and (3) occupancy expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the same period in 2003 due to additional fees for outside professionals, including those related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance and litigation activities. General and administrative expenses also increased as a result of the inclusion of Travelweb and Active Hotels. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Information Technology $ 9,171 $ 8,898 3.1 % % of Total Gross Profit 4.6 % 6.1 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, information technology expenses increased from the same period in 2003 primarily due to integration and related operating expenses resulting from the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Depreciation and Amortization $ 13,501 $ 11,533 17.1 % % of Total Gross Profit 6.8 % 7.9 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (2) depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and (4) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives primarily associated with the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the 56 acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels, partially offset by a decrease in the depreciable base of certain long-lived assets. Restructuring, Severance, and Special Charges In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $564,000. This restructuring charge resulted from a re-evaluation and refinement of our estimated real estate costs related to leased property vacated in connection with the 2002 and 2000 restructurings. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $4.7 million. This restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel businesses and a reduction in headcount. The repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel business. The charge relates primarily to severance payments, real estate costs and asset impairments. We estimate, based on current information available, the remaining net cash outflows associated with our restructuring related commitments will be paid in 2005. These restructuring accruals are recorded in “Accrued expenses” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Interest Income $ 5,112 $ 2,474 106.6 % Interest Expense (3,722 ) (907 ) 310.4 % Total $ 1,390 $ 1,567 (11.3 )% For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, net interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2003, primarily due to higher overall cash and investment balances. Interest income was partially offset by interest expense, including coupon interest and amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of our $125 million aggregate principal amount 1% Convertible Senior Notes issued in August 2003, and our $100 million aggregate principal amount 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes issued in June 2004. Equity in Income(Loss) of Investees, net Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2004 2003 Change Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees, net $ (566 ) $ 2,331 (124.3 )% Equity in loss of investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, represented our pro rata share of the net loss of Travelweb, prior to our acquisition of a majority of its equity in May and December 2004, and our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net income. The decrease in equity in 57 income of investees was primarily due to (1) increases in interest rates which caused a slowdown in the refinancing activity by pricelinemortgage.com’s customers that pricelinemortgage.com benefited from throughout 2003, and (2) the settlement by pricelinemortgage.com, in the fourth quarter 2004, of a patent infringement lawsuit and associated legal fees that negatively impact their 2004 operating results. Taxes For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an income tax benefit of $193,000. The benefit relates to (1) federal alternative minimum taxes related to income earned in the United States and (2) a net foreign tax benefit related to the operations of Active Hotels in the U.K. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2003 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2003, we experienced a decrease in total revenue of approximately $140 million primarily due to a decline in the sale of merchant airline tickets, partially offset by the improved performance of our hotel and rental car services. Additionally, we have experienced a shift in our airline ticket business mix from a primarily merchant opaque model to include a growing number of retail, price disclosed tickets. Because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis, revenues could decrease and gross profit will become an increasing important measure of evaluating growth in our business. The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold were as follows: Year Ended Airline Tickets Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days Gross Bookings December 31, 2003 1.8 million 5.7 million 3.7 million $ 1,101.3 million December 31, 2002 2.9 million 4.1 million 2.9 million $ 1,165.2 million Gross Bookings declined 5.5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002 primarily as a result of a decline in the sale of merchant airline tickets, partially offset by the improved performance of our hotel and rental car services. Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of: (1) merchant revenues; (2) agency revenues; and (3) other revenues. Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Merchant Revenues $ 852,454 $ 996,112 (14.4 )% Agency Revenues 7,554 720 949.2 % Other Revenues 3,653 6,774 (46.1 )% Total Revenues $ 863,661 $ 1,003,606 (13.9 )% 58 Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and determine the price to be paid by the customer. Merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of: (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; (2) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and (3) ancillary fees, including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees for merchant transactions only. The approximately $144 million decrease in merchant revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 was primarily attributable to the decrease in the number of Name Your Own Price® tickets sold, which was partially offset by the improved performance of our Name Your Own Price® hotel and rental car services. We believe that the decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets sold – and the corresponding effect that decrease had on our overall merchant revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 – continued to be due primarily to the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the tradeoffs associated with our Name Your Own Price® airline service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates to purchase travel services at the lower retail rates or from “low-cost” carriers without having to make any trade-offs. In addition, many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and upon the outbreak of war in Iraq and the outbreak of SARS, thus decreasing capacity on existing flights, which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us. In addition, in the past, we have “subsidized” certain Name Your Own Price® offers to purchase merchant airline tickets by adding a variable amount to some customers’ offers to increase the likelihood that such customers’ offers would be successful. These “subsidies” had the effect of, among other things, increasing the number of merchant airline tickets sold and our merchant revenues but at the expense of lower gross margins. At the end of 2002, we made the strategic decision to reduce sales of subsidized airline tickets. To this end, we reduced subsidies we have historically applied to certain merchant airline ticket offers. While this has had the effect of reducing the number of merchant airline tickets sold and our revenue during 2003, it has positively contributed to our gross profit and gross margin. The year-over-year decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets sold, and the corresponding effect it had on our merchant revenue, was partially offset by the increase in hotel room nights and rental car days sold in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. We believe that the increase in hotel room night sold during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same periods in 2002 was principally driven by our emphasis on our hotel business, and specifically by the success of our advertising campaign focused on our hotel service, and the competitive room inventory and pricing we receive from our hotel partners. We believe the increase in rental car days sold during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same periods in 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our rental car service, which we believe was driven by, among other things, an increase in visits to our website as a result of our advertising, and an overall increase in demand for leisure rental cars generally, improvements we made to the presentation of our rental car service on our website and improvement in the inventory and pricing we receive from our rental car partners. Agency Revenues Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of products are determined by third parties. Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of: (1) processing fees and third-party supplier commissions related to the sale of travel services including the sale of price disclosed airline tickets, cruises and other travel services; and (2) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to price-disclosed transactions. Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 59 increased approximately 949% from the same period a year ago, primarily as a result of our increased focus on the retail airline ticket and rental car business and the resulting increase in travel commissions and processing fees earned. Other Revenues Other revenues during twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services and to AIG for travel insurance and in 2002 automobile services; (3) in 2002, transaction revenue from our long distance phone service, which we repositioned in 2002; and (4) in 2002, license fees from Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Other revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 decreased approximately 46% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, primarily as a result of the decrease in fees earned from our home financing service, and due to our repositioning of our long distance phone service. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Cost of Merchant Revenues $ 717,716 $ 844,142 (15.0 )% % of Merchant Revenues 84.2 % 84.7 % Cost of Agency Revenues $ — $ — — % of Agency Revenues — — Cost of Other Revenues $ — $ 1,098 (100.0 )% % of Other Revenues — 16.2 % Total Cost of Revenues $ 717,716 $ 845,240 (15.1 )% % of Revenues 83.1 % 84.2 % Cost of Revenues Cost of Merchant Revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (2) the cost of hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of hotel occupancy tax; and (3) the cost of rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes. Cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, decreased approximately 15%, primarily due to a decrease in sales of merchant airline tickets, as discussed above. Cost of Agency Revenues. Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any. 60 Cost of Other Revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, cost of other revenues consisted of the cost of long distance telephone service provided by our suppliers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, there were no such costs due to the repositioning of our long distance telephone service in the fourth quarter of 2002. Gross Profit. Total gross profit decreased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, by $12.4 million primarily as a result of the decrease in sales of merchant airline tickets, described above. Partially offsetting the reduction in total gross profit was growth in merchant hotel and rental car gross profit as well as an increase in agency gross profit. Total gross profit, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, increased during the period ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same period during 2002 as a result of an ongoing shift in our business mix from primarily merchant opaque transactions, reported on a gross basis, to include more retail agency transactions, recorded on a net basis. Because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis, gross profit will become an increasing important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Merchant Gross Profit $ 134,738 $ 151,970 (11.3 )% Merchant Gross Margin 15.8 % 15.3 % Agency Gross Profit $ 7,554 $ 720 949.2 % Agency Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Other Gross Profit $ 3,653 $ 5,676 (35.6 )% Other Gross Margin 100.0 % 83.8 % Total Gross Profit $ 145,945 $ 158,366 (7.8 )% Total Gross Margin 16.9 % 15.8 % The following table represents the percentage of gross profit, by category, in relation to total gross profit: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Year Ended December 31, 2002 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Merchant gross profit 94.3 % 93.5 % 93.0 % 87.9 % 95.6 % 97.0 % 95.4 % 95.5 % Agency gross profit 3.1 % 3.7 % 4.6 % 10.0 % 0.5 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % Other gross profit 2.6 % 2.8 % 2.4 % 2.1 % 3.9 % 2.6 % 4.2 % 4.1 % Merchant Gross Profit. Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, merchant gross profit decreased from the same period in 2002, primarily due to the continued weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us, factors which are described in “Merchant Revenues,” above, in more detail. As discussed in “Merchant Revenues” above, at the end of 2002, we strategically reduced subsidies applied to certain Name Your Own Price® airline ticket sales. While this resulted in a reduction 61 in merchant revenues, the subsidy reduction positively affected our gross profit and increased our gross margin. We are able to manage the level of gross margins by controlling the price at which we will cause offers to be fulfilled. Our merchant gross margin in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased over the same periods a year ago primarily as the result of a shift in mix of our services from the sale of airline tickets to the sale of hotel room nights and rental car days. Agency Gross Profit. Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which is recorded net of agency costs, if any. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2002 due to an increase in the sale of disclosed price airline tickets, rental cars and related fees and commissions. Other Gross Profit. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, other gross profit decreased over the same period in 2002 as a result of decreases in fees earned in connection with our long distance phone service and home financing services and decrease in license fees from Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Offline Advertising $ 25,125 $ 27,022 (7.0 )% % of Total Gross Profit 17.2 % 17.1 % Online Advertising $ 17,123 $ 17,642 (2.9 )% % of Total Gross Profit 11.7 % 11.1 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and radio advertising; and (2) agency fees, creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, offline advertising expenses decreased over the same period in 2002 primarily due to a shift from primarily radio advertising to lower absolute dollars spent on television advertising and partially offset by an increase in production and creative talent fees. Online advertising expenses consist primarily of banners, pop-ups, keyword searches, affiliate programs and e-mail advertisements. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, online advertising expenses decreased over the same period in 2002, primarily due to a reduction in our use of certain online advertising channels. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Sales and Marketing $ 33,441 $ 32,699 2.3 % % of Total Gross Profit 22.9 % 20.6 % 62 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; (3) provisions for credit card charge-backs; and (4) warrant costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The warrant charge related to the issuance of warrants to purchase priceline.com common stock to Marriott International, Inc. during the first quarter 2003. There was no similar charge during 2002. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, sales and marketing expenses, increased over the same periods in 2002 due primarily to the issuance of warrants to Marriott, partially offset by a decrease in variable sales and marketing expenses. Personnel Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Personnel $ 29,962 $ 33,045 (9.3 )% % of Total Gross Profit 20.5 % 20.9 % Personnel expenses consist primarily of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock based compensation. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, personnel expenses decreased over the same periods in 2002 due to the full-year effect of a reduction in headcount undertaken during our fourth quarter 2002 restructuring, partially offset by an increase in employee bonus expense. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change General and Administrative $ 12,031 $ 13,298 (9.5 )% % of Total Gross Profit 8.2 % 8.4 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) business insurance; (2) fees for outside professionals; (3) occupancy expenses; and (4) telecommunications costs. General and administrative expenses decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the same periods in 2002 as a result of decreases in employment agency fees, taxes and stock based compensation, partially offset by higher professional fees and premiums on our Directors and Officers liability insurance policies. General and administrative expenses were also impacted by the favorable resolution of certain obligations, without which the year-over-year reduction would have been approximately 5%. 63 Information Technology Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Information Technology $ 8,898 $ 12,008 (25.9 )% % of Total Gross Profit 6.1 % 7.6 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet site; and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, information technology expenses decreased over the same period in 2002 primarily as a result of cost efficiencies generated by cost savings initiatives, additional capitalized development costs associated with the launch of our retail services. In addition, Information Technology expenses were reduced by the favorable settlement of certain vendor disputes related to data communications and telecom expenses without which the year-over-year reduction would have been approximately 23%. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Depreciation and Amortization $ 11,533 $ 18,264 (36.9 )% % of Total Gross Profit 7.9 % 11.5 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (2) depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of our leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and (4) amortization of our intangible assets with determinable lives. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and amortization expense decreased over the same periods in 2002, primarily as a result of a smaller depreciable asset base and a reduction in capital expenditures in 2003. Restructuring, Severance, and Special Charges In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $564,000. This restructuring charge resulted from a re-evaluation and refinement of our estimated real estate costs related to leased property vacated in connection with the 2002 and 2000 restructurings. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $4.7 million. This restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel businesses and a reduction in headcount. The repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel business. The charge relates primarily to severance payments, real estate costs and asset impairments. As a result of the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring, our work force was reduced by 59 full-time employees at our Norwalk location and 4 full-time employees at our Europe location. The employee 64 termination costs primarily represent severance payments and related benefits. The real estate costs primarily represent the estimated net lease expense related to space we decided we no longer needed, and which we will not utilize in the future along with certain required refurbishments to that space. Asset impairments are comprised of abandoned equipment and software projects, and software costs related to our plans not to pursue certain service offerings and activities. Other restructuring charges include professional and other fees and costs incurred in 2002 associated with the restructuring activities. During 2003 and 2002, we decreased the liability for the restructuring charge by approximately $753,000 and approximately $916,000, respectively. These reductions resulted from the favorable resolution of certain matters, primarily the collection of certain receivables and the settlement of real estate commitments, and were reflected as an adjustment to the “Restructuring charge (reversal)” line on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Restructuring accruals are recorded in “Accrued expenses” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Impairment Charge During the third quarter of 2002, we performed impairment tests and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill of $22.5 million related to our European operations exceeded its implied fair value by approximately $12 million and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of $12 million. The fair value was determined using generally accepted valuation techniques including the market value of comparable companies (including revenue multiple methodology) and discounted cash flow. Underlying the impairment was a continued decline in the market value of priceline.com’s common stock, which we review quarterly as an indicator of possible impairment of priceline.com europe Ltd.’s carrying value, a deterioration in priceline.com europe Ltd.’s operations caused primarily by increasingly competitive conditions among European online travel companies and a decision in the third quarter of 2002 to reconfigure service offerings. During the third quarter of 2002 we performed a periodic evaluation of the progress of the operations of Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Factors including increasing negative variances in key operating metrics such as negative gross margins and continuing operating losses, negative net asset position and an increasingly competitive operating environment led us to determine that the carrying value of our convertible note no longer reflected its fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $12.2 million. Estimated fair value was determined using cash flow estimates and a review of the market value of comparable companies including the consideration of the decline in our market value and through discussion with third party valuation specialists. Interest Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Interest Income $ 2,474 $ 2,911 (15.0 )% Interest Expense (907 ) (68 ) 1,233.8 % Total $ 1,567 $ 2,843 (44.9 )% For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, interest income on cash and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2002 due to lower interest rates. Interest income was also partially offset by interest expense, including amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection 65 with the issuance of our $125 million aggregate principal amount 1% Convertible Senior Notes. Interest on the notes is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Equity in Income of Investees, net Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2003 2002 Change Equity in Income of Investees, net $ 2,331 $ 1,131 106.1 % Equity in income of investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 of $2.3 million, represented our pro rata share of the net income of pricelinemortgage.com and, in 2003, our pro rata share of the net loss of Travelweb. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2004, we had $247.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Approximately $23.6 million is restricted cash on deposit collateralizing letters of credit issued in favor of certain suppliers and landlords. Also included in restricted cash are amounts held by our credit card processor company. We generally invest excess cash to make such funds readily available for operating purposes. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of highly liquid, high quality, investment grade debt instruments. All of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers over a ten to fifteen day period. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter. This can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would indicate. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $42.0 million, resulting from net income of $31.5 million, non-cash items not affecting December 31, 2004 cash flows of $17.7 million, partially offset by $7.2 million of changes in working capital. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2004, were primarily related to a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable and a $4.4 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in revenues attributable to increased hotel, vacation package and rental car transactions. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to seasonal decreases in deferred merchant bookings and accounts payable balances. Non-cash items were primarily associated with the depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, primarily those acquired in our acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $20.0 million, resulting from net income of $11.9 and $10.5 million of changes in working capital offset by non-cash items not affecting December 31 cash flows of approximately $18.6 million. The changes in working capital were primarily related to an approximately $13.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The decrease in accounts payable was related to our year-end supplier payables only being outstanding for 10 calendar days, as compared to 15 calendar days in 2002. The decrease was also attributable to cash payments related to our restructuring during the year, and a general decrease in expenses which resulted in lower trade accounts payable and accrued expense balances. Non-cash items were primarily a warrant charge related to the Marriott transaction discussed earlier, and the depreciation and amortization of property and equipment. 66 Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and approximately $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we invested $164.7 million, net of cash acquired, in acquisitions, the substantial majority of which related to Active Hotels. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Lowestfare.com, our wholly-owned subsidiary, invested approximately $14.2 million in our initial equity investment in Travelweb and other acquisitions. Investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2004 was affected by the maturities of short-term investments and marketable securities in the amount of $28.2 million. In both years, net cash used in investing activities was also affected by purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $107.2 million and $118.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2004, was primarily the $100 million proceeds from our issuance of 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes and, for the year ended December 31, 2003, the $125 million proceeds from the issuance of 1% Convertible Senior Notes. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options provided cash of $6.8 million and $10.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following table represents the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004: Payments due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than One Year Two to Three Years Four to Five Years After Five Years Operating lease obligations $ 18,657 $ 3,085 $ 5,672 $ 5,874 $ 4,026 Convertible debt(1) 240,637 3,500 7,000 130,045 100,092 Series B mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (2) 13,470 — 13,470 — — Total $ 272,764 $ 6,585 $ 26,142 $ 135,919 $ 104,118 (1) Assumes redemption of 1% Senior Convertible Notes during August 2008 and 2.25% Senior Convertible Notes during January 2010. Assumes no conversion of the Notes into common stock. (2) Assumes no additional exercise of warrants and redemption of Redeemable Preferred stock during February 2007. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Priceline.com leases certain property, primarily space in buildings in Norwalk, Connecticut; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas (Travelweb); Cambridge and London, England (Active Hotels); and Staines, England (priceline.com europe). These leases are accounted for as operating leases. The operating lease obligations represent the minimum payments for our operating leases. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2003, we issued, in a private placement, $125 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an interest rate of 1% (the “1% Notes”). The 1% Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into our common stock, par value $0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price of approximately $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Each $1,000 principal amount of 1% Notes will initially be convertible into 25 shares of our common stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period, as defined in the offering memorandum related to the 1% Notes, is more than 110% of the then current conversion price of the 1% Notes, or after August 1, 2008, if the closing price of our common stock is more than 110% of the then current conversion price of the 1% Notes. The 1% Notes 67 are also convertible in certain other circumstances set forth in the offering memorandum, such as a change in control of priceline.com. In addition, the 1% Notes will be redeemable at our option beginning in 2008, and the holders may require us to repurchase the 1% Notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other circumstances. Interest on the 1% Notes is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we swapped the fixed 1% interest on the 1% Notes for a floating interest rate based on the 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, minus the applicable margin of approximately 221 basis points, on $45 million notional value of debt. This agreement expires August 1, 2010. We designated this interest rate swap agreement as a fair value hedge. The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and the underlying debt are recorded as offsetting gains and losses in interest income and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In June 2004, we issued, in a private placement, $100 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2025, with an interest rate of 2.25% (the “2.25% Notes”). The 2.25% Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into our common stock at the option of the holder, at a conversion price of approximately $37.95 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Each $1,000 principal amount of 2.25% Notes will initially be convertible into 26.3505 shares of our common stock if, on or prior to January 15, 2025, certain conditions occur. The 2.25% Notes are also convertible in certain other circumstances set forth in the offering memorandum, such as a change in control of priceline.com. In the event that all or substantially all of our common stock is acquired prior to January 15, 2010, in a transaction in which the consideration paid to holders of our common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, we would be required to make additional payments to the holders of amounts ranging from $0 to $19.1 million depending upon the date of the transaction and our then current stock price. In addition, the 2.25% Notes will be redeemable at our option beginning January 20, 2010, and the holders may require us to repurchase the 2.25% Notes on January 15, 2010, 2015 and 2020 or in certain other circumstances. Interest on the 2.25% Notes is payable January 15 and July 15 of each year. During 2004, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 1% Notes and the 2.25% Notes in the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. The remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes, strategic uses and working capital requirements. Excluded from the table above are letters of credit aggregating approximately $10.7 million that were issued in favor of certain suppliers and landlords. The letters of credit expire between March 2005 and March 2006 and are generally subject to automatic renewal upon expiration of the letter of credit. Also excluded are employment agreements with certain members of senior management that provide for minimum annual compensation, upon termination of employment, of approximately $4.5 million. Our Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus an amount equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid, and is subject to mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007. In the event that we consummate certain business combination transactions, our Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed at our option or at the option of the holder at the liquidation preference per outstanding share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends and dividends that would have accrued through February 6, 2007. There were 13,470 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2004. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the rights and preferences of our Series B Preferred Stock. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business strategies, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial 68 condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue growth will continue or that future borrowings or equity contributions will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, repay and debt or preferred stock or finance our business strategies. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments, including an interest rate hedge to manage market risks. The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in interest rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates on a daily basis. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future interest rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future interest rate exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2004. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2004, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future. As of December 31, 2004, after adjusting for the effect of the interest rate swap agreement, we have fixed rate debt of approximately $224.4 million. We estimate that the fair market value of our debt was approximately $215.9 million as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, we held an interest rate swap agreement on $45 million notional value of our fixed rate debt. The fair value (cost if terminated) of this swap as of December 31, 2004 was approximately $692,000. A 10% adverse fluctuation in the 3-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2004, would decrease the interest rate swap’s fair value by approximately $537,000. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability, or cash flow. International net revenues result from transactions by Active Hotels and are typically denominated in British Pounds, the functional currency of Active Hotels. Active Hotels also incurs most of its expenses in British Pounds. Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. 69 Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as well as our results of operations. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of Active Hotels are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In January 2005, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short-term foreign currency fluctuations on the operating results of Active Hotels. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the currency translation gains and losses recognized in other accumulated comprehensive income. No forward contracts or other economic hedges were entered into during the year ended December 31, 2004, however, we may enter into such forward contracts or other economic hedges in the future. We convert the financial statements of Active Hotels into U.S. dollars. When there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the conversion of Active Hotels’ financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss. Translation exposure is the change in the book value of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that results from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time we may enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using both foreign currency options and forward contracts. Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate volatility. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by such changes.",2023-12-30 18:44:28.487745

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors.” Overview General. We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation packages and cruises. We offer our customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase travel services in a traditional, price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique Name Your Own Price® service, which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at discounted prices. At present, we derive substantially all of our revenues from the following sources: • Transaction revenues from our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car services, as well as our vacation packages service; • Commissions earned from the sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and other travel services; • Customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both Name Your Own Price® and price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars service; • Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees related to both our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car service, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car service; • Transaction revenue from our price-disclosed hotel room service; and • Other revenues derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites. Trends. The online sale of travel services has been one of the fastest growing sectors of the Internet since the late 1990s. While the online market for travel services continues to experience significant annualized growth, we believe that the domestic market share of third-party distributors, like priceline.com, has declined over the recent past and that the growth of the domestic online market for travel services has slowed. We believe the decline in market share is attributable, in part, to a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing. In addition, over the course of 2005, airlines and hotel chains have generally experienced year-over-year increases in load factors (a common metric that measures airplane customer usage) and occupancy rates (a common metric that measures hotel customer usage), respectively, which leaves them with less excess inventory to provide third party intermediaries like priceline.com. Notwithstanding these trends, we continue to believe that the market for online travel services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for growth, in particular, in certain international markets. Because we believe that an opportunity for growth exists in certain international markets, and since prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, substantially all of our revenue was generated in the U.S., we have taken steps to expand the markets we serve. In September 2004, we acquired Active Hotels Ltd., a U.K. based online hotel service. Active Hotels gives us a strong presence in the U.K.’s online hotel 44 market. Furthermore, in July 2005, we acquired Amsterdam-based Bookings B.V., one of Europe’s leading Internet hotel reservation services, with offices primarily in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Loule, Paris, Rome and Pisa. All of our European operations, including Active Hotels and Bookings, are majority-owned by us. A minority interest in our European business is held by our managers responsible for that business. We work with a range of chain-owned and independently owned hotels across Europe and in major cities around the world to provide hotel reservations on various websites in multiple languages. Our European operations are an important contributor to our business and we expect that over the course of 2006, they will represent a growing percentage of our total gross bookings and net income. In addition to the ongoing businesses of our European operations, which consist primarily of offering European hotel rooms to European customers, over the course of 2006, we intend to offer European customers access to our U.S. based travel services and to enhance the European travel services that we currently offer U.S. customers. As our European operations become more meaningful contributors to our results, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in certain of our operating expenses and other financial metrics. For example, because our European operations utilize online affiliate marketing and Internet search engines, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords, as principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our online advertising expense has increased significantly since our acquisition of those companies, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2006. In addition, and as discussed in more detail below, since the acquisitions of Active Hotels and Bookings, we have seen the effects of seasonal fluctuation on our results change as a result of different revenue recognition policies that apply to our European hotel service (as well as our domestic retail hotel service) and the increased importance European hotel bookings to our results of operations. Our overall financial prospects and, in particular, the financial prospects of our domestic business, have been and continue to be significantly dependent upon the sale of leisure airline tickets and, as a result, the health of our business has been directly related to the health of the airline industry. Most domestic airlines, and many of our major suppliers, have experienced, and continue to experience, significant losses. These losses have been compounded by competition from low-cost carriers and, more recently, by high fuel prices, which we believe increase the possibility of the additional bankruptcy and/or the liquidation of one or more of the major domestic airlines. As a result of these and other factors, many of the major airlines have deeply discounted retail airline tickets to maintain market share, simplified fare structures by removing restrictions associated with certain airline tickets and, as discussed in more detail in “Other” below, put pressure on third-party intermediaries like us to reduce airline distribution costs. These actions have had, and continue to have, a detrimental effect on our overall airline business and, in particular, our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket service, which historically represented a significant portion of our total airline ticket revenues. As a result of the continued decline in sales of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets over the last several years, we have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify our revenue among “non-opaque” services, such as allowing our customers to purchase price-disclosed retail airline, hotel and rental car travel services, which we believe will help broaden our customer appeal. We intend to continue to execute on our strategy of diversifying our service offerings and markets, through both continued internal development of services and, if appropriate, acquisitions. As a result of the diversification described above, the growth rates for our “agency” businesses, which are generally comprised of our price-disclosed retail services, have, over the recent past, significantly exceeded the growth rates for our “merchant” businesses, which are comprised primarily of our slower-growing Name Your Own Price® services. 45 Other. A number of travel suppliers, particularly airlines, have indicated publicly that, as part of an effort to reduce distribution costs, they intend to reduce their dependence over time on what they view to be “expensive” distribution channels such as global distribution systems (GDSs). A number of travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that require rebates of all or part of the fees received from the GDS. We have agreed to rebate certain GDS costs to certain suppliers in exchange for contractual considerations such as those relating to inventory pricing and availability, and expect to continue to do so in the future. Additionally, travel suppliers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to develop technology to bypass the GDS, such as enabling direct connections to the travel suppliers or using other alternatives to traditional GDSs. Development of such technology would require the use of information technology resources and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other projects. We have been and believe that we will continue to be under significant pressure from travel suppliers, including most of the major domestic airlines and many of our significant hotel suppliers, to rebate all or part of the travel booking fees we receive from Worldspan, L.P. and to significantly reduce or eliminate their distribution costs. We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our leisure travel business, to continue to promote the priceline.com brand and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease; natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes; terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East or elsewhere; or the liquidation of major domestic airlines now in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or the withdrawal from our system of a major airline (or the consolidation of our major airline suppliers) or hotel supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability. Seasonality Prior to introducing a retail travel option to our customers, substantially all of our business was conducted under the Name Your Own Price® system and accordingly, because those services are non-refundable in nature, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking was generated. We recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel service, however, including our European operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel. As a result, we have seen and expect to continue to see, that a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized until future quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we expense all of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which bookings are generated. Therefore, as our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on- 46 going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management, including the following: • Merchant Revenues and Merchant Cost of Revenues Name Your Own Price® Services: Merchant revenues and related cost of revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our customers, remitting payments to our suppliers and establishing the price of the services we offer. We recognize such revenue and costs if and when we accept and fulfill the customer’s non-refundable offer. Merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include the selling price and cost, respectively, of the travel services and are reported on a gross basis. Pursuant to the terms of our hotel service, our hotel suppliers are permitted to bill us for the underlying cost of the service during a specified period of time. In the event that we are not billed by our hotel supplier within the specified time period, we reduce our cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts. Merchant Price-Disclosed Hotel Service: Merchant revenues for our merchant price-disclosed hotel service are derived from transactions where customers use our service to purchase hotel rooms from hotel suppliers at rates which are subject to contractual arrangements. Charges are billed to customers at the time of booking and are included in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer completes his or her stay. Such amounts are generally refundable upon cancellation prior to stay, subject to cancellation penalties in certain cases. Merchant revenues and accounts payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at the conclusion of the customer’s stay at the hotel. We record the difference between the selling price and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue. • Agency Revenues and Cost of Revenues. Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the products sold are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Such revenues are recognized at the conclusion of the customer’s travel. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and the age of the commission receivable. • Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance. As required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Management concluded in the third quarter 2005, based upon its assessment of positive and negative evidence, that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash tax benefit in the third quarter 2005 of $170.5 million, resulting from a reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. We believe that it is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized and, 47 accordingly, a valuation allowance against those assets remains. The valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change, causing a reassessment of the realization of its deferred tax assets. • Accounting for State and Local “Hotel Occupancy” Taxes. As discussed in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, several jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against us alleging, among other things, that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by a customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room. Historically, we have not collected taxes on this differential. Additional state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively, or both. To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have additional tax exposures. We will continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposures, and to the extent appropriate, we will reserve for those estimated liabilities. • Airline Debit Memos. Our airline suppliers periodically send us debit memos that make claims for additional amounts due to them related to the cost of airline tickets we sold on their behalf. We process the debit memos received and, when appropriate, make payments to the airlines. Based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with the airlines, we establish reserves for estimated losses resulting from these claims. • Allowance for Credit Card Charge-backs. Because we act as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs. • Refunds. In limited circumstances, we make certain accommodations for customers or provide refunds to customers to satisfy disputes and complaints. Based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with our suppliers, we establish reserves for estimated losses resulting from these accommodations. • Valuation of Goodwill. We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired including Bookings, Active Hotels, Travelweb and priceline.com europe Ltd. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine that some part or all of the goodwill is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded. 48 • Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. • Equity Investments. We have, among other investments, a 49% equity interest in pricelinemortgage.com and, accordingly, recognize our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s operating results, not to exceed an amount that we believe represents the investment’s estimated fair value. The carrying value of the investment at December 31, 2005 was $10.7 million. We periodically test this investment for impairment using a number of assumptions and estimates. In the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine that some part or all of the carrying value of pricelinemortgage.com is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Operating Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers. The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold through our websites and the related gross bookings were as follows: Year Ended Airline Tickets Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days Gross Bookings December 31, 2005 2.8 million 11.8 million 5.8 million $ 2,227 million December 31, 2004 2.8 million 7.8 million 5.1 million $ 1,688 million Airline tickets sold decreased by 0.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, over the same period in 2004. The decrease in the number of airline tickets sold in the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily attributable to a significant percentage decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, largely offset by an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets. Hotel room nights sold increased by 51.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, over the same period in 2004. The increase in the number of hotel room nights sold in the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to the inclusion of hotel room nights sold through our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Active Hotels and Bookings, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2004 and 2005, respectively, and our merchant price-disclosed hotel service, which was integrated after our acquisition of Travelweb during 49 the second quarter 2004. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, in part due to the increased focus on our website of our merchant price-disclosed hotel service. Rental car days sold increased by 13.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, over the same period in 2004 due to increases in sales of our opaque rental car service, increases in sales of our retail rental car service, which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2004, and the launch of new features, including options for one-way destination and off-airport car rentals. Gross bookings increased by 32.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004. The increase was driven primarily by an increase of 81.6% in “agency” bookings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, which was primarily attributable to (1) the inclusion of approximately $468 million of gross bookings from our European operations; (2) the increased sale of retail airline tickets; (3) the inclusion of agency gross bookings relating to our retail hotel service launched in March 2005; and (4) the increased sale of retail rental cars. Merchant gross bookings increased by 1.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel bookings, mostly offset by a decrease in the sale of opaque airline tickets. Revenues We classify our revenue into three categories: • Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our customers, remitting payments to our suppliers and establishing the price of the services we offer. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotels; and (4) ancillary fees, including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions. • Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. • Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our airline ticket business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of merchant (“opaque”) Name Your Own Price® travel services to a business that includes the sale of retail, price-disclosed travel services. Because merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services are reported on a “gross” basis and retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Additionally, our European operations contributed approximately $70 million to our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Revenues generated by our European operations are primarily recorded on a “net” basis. 50 Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Merchant Revenues $ 859,404 $ 872,994 (1.6 )% Agency Revenues 99,051 38,601 156.6 % Other Revenues 4,205 2,777 51.4 % Total Revenues $ 962,660 $ 914,372 5.3 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 decreased by 1.6%, compared to the same period in 2004 due to a substantial percentage decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, which was partially offset by an increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel bookings. We believe that the decrease in the number of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets sold continued to be due primarily to low retail airline ticket prices and the availability of retail tickets on our website. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade­offs associated with our Name Your Own Price® airline service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel services at the lower retail rates, or from “low-cost” carriers, without having to make any trade-offs. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 increased 157%, compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of (1) the inclusion of approximately $67 million of agency revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, from our European operations; and (2) increased sales of retail airline tickets, hotels and rental cars, partially offset by a decrease in Worldspan, L.P. GDS fees. Results from our European operations consist of a full year of operations from Active Hotels, which was acquired in September 2004, and approximately six months of operations from Bookings, which was acquired in July 2005. Other Revenues Other revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services. Other revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 increased compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenue. 51 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Cost of Merchant Revenues $ 694,190 $ 714,822 (2.9 )% % of Merchant Revenues 80.8 % 81.9 % Cost of Agency Revenues 607 1,395 (56.5 )% % of Agency Revenues 0.6 % 3.6 % Cost of Other Revenues — — — % of Other Revenues — — Total Cost of Revenues $ 694,797 $ 716,217 (3.0 )% % of Revenues 72.2 % 78.3 % Cost of Revenues During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, cost of revenues decreased by 3.0%, compared to the same period in 2004, due primarily to a shift in the mix of revenue from merchant services toward agency services that have higher gross margins. Merchant Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions as compared to retail transactions which are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Cost of Merchant Revenues For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (4) non-cash acquisition-related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of Travelweb. Cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 decreased by 2.9%, compared to the same period in 2004, due primarily to a decrease in overall merchant revenues. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues are recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of Agency Revenues Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with our recent acquisitions. 52 Cost of Other Revenues For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no costs of other revenues. Gross Profit Total gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 increased by 35.2% compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1) the inclusion of results from our European operations which consist of a full year of operations from Active Hotels which was acquired in September 2004, and approximately six months of operations from Bookings, which was acquired in July 2005; and (2) increased sales of retail travel services. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to agency and merchant price-disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Merchant Gross Profit $ 165,214 $ 158,172 4.5 % Merchant Gross Margin 19.2 % 18.1 % Agency Gross Profit 98,444 37,206 164.6 % Agency Gross Margin 99.4 % 96.4 % Other Gross Profit 4,205 2,777 51.4 % Other Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Total Gross Profit $ 267,863 $ 198,155 35.2 % Total Gross Margin 27.8 % 21.7 % Merchant Gross Profit Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, merchant gross profit increased from the same period in 2004, primarily due to the inclusion of gross profit relating to our merchant price-disclosed hotel service and growth in our Name Your Own Price® rental car service, partially offset by a substantial decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Merchant gross margin increased primarily because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, when compared to merchant price-disclosed hotel transactions, which are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. 53 Agency Gross Profit Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which are recorded net of agency costs, if any. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2004, primarily due to the inclusion of the results of our European operations, and an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets, hotels and rental cars, partially offset by a decrease in Worldspan, L.P. GDS fees. Other Gross Profit During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, other gross profit increased from the same period in 2004 primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Offline Advertising $ 30,957 $ 33,476 (7.5 )% % of Total Gross Profit 11.6 % 16.9 % Online Advertising $ 58,535 $ 27,480 113.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 21.9 % 13.9 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with television and radio advertising; and (2) agency fees, the cost for creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, offline advertising expenses were lower than in the same period in 2004, as we shifted more of our advertising budget to online. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail advertisements. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2004, primarily due to the inclusion of the online advertising expenses related to our European operations and our merchant price-disclosed hotel service, each of which relies primarily on online advertising to drive its business. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Sales and Marketing $ 34,295 $ 32,091 6.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 12.8 % 16.2 % 54 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions for credit card charge-backs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2004, due to increased gross booking volumes and the inclusion of sales and marketing expenses associated with our European operations. Personnel Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Personnel $ 49,659 $ 35,574 39.6 % % of Total Gross Profit 18.5 % 18.0 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock based compensation. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2004, primarily due to the inclusion of personnel expenses associated with our European operations and an increase in stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock grants to employees and directors. Stock based compensation expense was approximately $4.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and approximately $0.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 General and Administrative $ 20,881 $ 16,452 26.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 7.8 % 8.3 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals; (2) business insurance; (3) occupancy expenses; and (4) litigation related expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 over the same period during 2004, due to the inclusion of our European operations and additional fees for outside professionals and expenses related to pending litigation. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Information Technology $ 10,622 $ 9,171 15.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 4.0 % 4.6 % 55 Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, information technology expenses increased from the same period in 2004 primarily due to the inclusion of information technology expenses associated with our European operations. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Depreciation and Amortization $ 25,366 $ 13,501 87.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 9.5 % 6.8 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of the inclusion of non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with our European operations. Restructuring Charge (Reversal) Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Restructuring Charge (Reversal) $ 1,664 $ (12 ) NM In 2005, we recorded a net restructuring charge of $1.7 million, comprised of a $2.0 million charge based upon a re-evaluation of the estimated costs related to leased property originally vacated in 2000, partly offset by a $0.3 million reversal based upon a re-evaluation of estimated costs to complete certain European restructuring activities. Interest Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Interest Income $ 5,550 $ 5,112 8.6 % Interest Expense (5,075 ) (3,722 ) 36.4 % Total $ 475 $ 1,390 (65.8 )% 56 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2004, primarily due to higher prevailing interest rates. Interest expense increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 over the same period in 2004 because our 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes issued in June 2004 were outstanding for the entire twelve month period in 2005. Taxes For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $156 million. This principally resulted from a non-cash tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2005 of $171 million, relating to the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The non-cash tax benefit was recorded pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, that require a company to release a portion of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not that it will realize all or some portion of its deferred tax assets. Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income for the foreseeable future. As a result of the reversal, we recorded a mostly non-cash $12.5 million provision for U.S. income tax expense in our Consolidated Financial Statements in 2005, and will continue to record a non-cash provision for U.S. income tax expense in future periods. This non-cash U.S. income tax provision will materially negatively impact net income and earnings per share in subsequent periods as compared to prior periods. We expect to make cash tax payments for U.S. alternative minimum taxes and for certain international taxes. Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2005 2004 Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests $ 749 $ (511 ) 246.6 % Equity in income of investees and minority interests for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, represented (1) our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results, (2) minority interests associated with the 8.5% ownership of priceline.com International that is held by certain managers of that business and (3) until May 2004, our pro rata share of Travelweb’s net results. The increase in equity in income of investees and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to increases in equity in income of investees related to (1) our equity in the increase in pricelinemortgage.com’s net income in both periods and (2) the exclusion of our equity in the net loss of Travelweb subsequent to our acquisition of Travelweb in May 2004. This increase was partially offset by the inclusion of the aforementioned minority interests in priceline.com International. 57 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2004 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Operating Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers. The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold were as follows: Year Ended Airline Tickets Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days Gross Bookings December 31, 2004 2.8 million 7.8 million 5.1 million $ 1,688 million December 31, 2003 1.8 million 5.7 million 3.7 million $ 1,111 million Airline tickets sold increased by 55.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003. The increase was driven entirely by the introduction of retail choice to our airline service. The growth in each period was partially offset by large annualized percentage decreases in sales of opaque airline tickets sold in each period. See “Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Trends” above. Hotel room nights sold increased by 36.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003. The increase was driven by (1) the continued success of our opaque hotel service, which benefited from continued direct advertising support and (2) the inclusion of hotel room nights sold by Travelweb and Active Hotels during the respective periods in 2004, subsequent to their acquisitions. Rental car days sold increased by 37.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due to increases in sales of our opaque rental car service through priceline.com and our retail rental car service through priceline.com, Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com. Gross Bookings increased by 51.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003. The increase was driven primarily by a 336.4% increase in agency bookings in 2004 as a result of (1) the introduction of retail choice to our airline service and (2) the inclusion of approximately $54 million of bookings from Active Hotels in our 2004 results. Gross bookings also increased as a result of an 8.1% increase in merchant bookings in 2004, as a result of (1) the continued success of our opaque hotel, rental car and vacation package services which offset significant annualized declines in bookings of our opaque airline ticket service; and (2) the inclusion of approximately $75 million of bookings from Travelweb in our 2004 results. 58 Revenues We continue to experience a shift in our airline ticket business mix from a historically merchant opaque model to include a growing number of retail, price-disclosed tickets. Because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis, airline ticket revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in merchant and retail sales mix and gross profit has become an important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Additionally, our acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels during the second and third quarters, respectively, contributed approximately $23.6 million to our revenues in 2004. Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Merchant Revenues $ 872,994 $ 852,454 2.4 % Agency Revenues 38,601 7,554 411.0 % Other Revenues 2,777 3,653 (24.0 )% Total Revenues $ 914,372 $ 863,661 5.9 % Merchant Revenues The $20.5 million increase in merchant revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 was primarily attributable to continued growth in Name Your Own Price® hotels and our vacation package service, and the inclusion of approximately $15.5 million of revenues from Travelweb in 2004, subsequent to our acquisition of Travelweb, partially offset by (1) a substantial decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, and (2) decreased travel caused by the adverse weather in the Southeastern U.S. during the third quarter of 2004. We believe that the decrease in the number of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets sold – and the corresponding effect that decrease had on our overall merchant revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 – continued to be due primarily to low retail airline ticket prices and the availability of retail tickets on our website. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade-offs associated with our Name Your Own Price® airline service in exchange for 59 savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel services at the lower retail rates, or from “low-cost” carriers without having to make any trade-offs. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased from the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of (1) our increased focus on the retail airline ticket business, driven primarily by new advertising campaigns focused on our retail airline ticket and vacation packages service, (2) increased rental car business, including the impact of our acquisitions of Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com, and the resulting increase in travel commissions, GDS and processing fees earned, and (3) the inclusion of approximately $8 million of agency revenue from Active Hotels subsequent to our acquisition in September of 2004. Other Revenues Other revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services. Other revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 decreased compared to the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of lower financial services fees and reduced online advertising revenue. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Cost of Merchant Revenues $ 714,822 $ 717,716 (0.4 )% % of Merchant Revenues 81.9 % 84.2 % Cost of Agency Revenues 1,395 — % of Agency Revenues 3.6 % — — Cost of Other Revenues — — % of Other Revenues — — — Total Cost of Revenues $ 716,217 $ 717,716 (0.2 )% % of Revenues 78.3 % 83.1 % Cost of Revenues During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, cost of revenues decreased by approximately $1.5 million, over the same period in 2003, due primarily to a shift in the mix of revenue generated by services that produce higher gross margins. Specifically, our opaque hotel service, which produces the highest gross margins of our four principal opaque offerings, represented a higher percentage of total opaque revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003. Conversely, our opaque airline service, which produces lower gross margins, declined significantly on a year-over-year basis, and therefore represented a substantially lower percentage of total opaque revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003. Cost of revenues grew at a slower rate than revenues because opaque transactions, whose revenues 60 are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in both periods as compared to retail transactions (principally Travelweb) that are recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues. Cost of Merchant Revenues For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of hotel occupancy tax, (2) the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (4) non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of Travelweb. Cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, decreased approximately 0.4% compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to the shift in the mix of revenue generated by services that generate different levels of gross margins, as discussed above. Cost of Agency Revenues Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of Active Hotels. Cost of Other Revenues For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no costs of other revenues. Gross Profit Total gross profit increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, by approximately $52.2 million primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1) our opaque hotel and vacation package services; (2) increased sales of retail services; and (3) the inclusion of results from Travelweb and Active Hotels. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, compared to the same period in 2003, because opaque transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in both periods as compared to retail transactions which are recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because merchant transactions are reported gross and retail transactions (primarily Travelweb) are recorded on a net basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. 61 Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Merchant Gross Profit $ 158,172 $ 134,738 17.4 % Merchant Gross Margin 18.1 % 15.8 % Agency Gross Profit 37,206 7,554 392.5 % Agency Gross Margin 96.4 % 100.0 % Other Gross Profit 2,777 3,653 (24.0 )% Other Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Total Gross Profit $ 198,155 $ 145,945 35.8 % Total Gross Margin 21.7 % 16.9 % Merchant Gross Profit Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, merchant gross profit increased from the same period in 2003, primarily due to (1) increased revenue from Name Your Own Price® hotels and our vacation package service; (2) the inclusion of $12.3 million of gross profit from Travelweb; and (3) an increase in the percentage of our revenues represented by our opaque hotel, vacation packages and rental car services, which collectively have a higher gross margin than our opaque airline ticket service. Merchant gross margin also increased because opaque transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in 2004, when compared to retail transactions (primarily Travelweb), which are recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues. Agency Gross Profit Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which is recorded net of agency costs, if any. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2003 due to an increase in the sale of disclosed price airline tickets, rental cars and related processing, GDS fees and travel commissions, and the inclusion of the results of Active Hotels subsequent to our acquisition. Other Gross Profit During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, other gross profit decreased from the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of lower pricelinemortgage.com referral fees and reduced online advertising revenues. 62 Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Offline Advertising $ 33,476 $ 25,125 33.2 % % of Total Gross Profit 16.9 % 17.2 % Online Advertising $ 27,480 $ 17,123 60.5 % % of Total Gross Profit 13.9 % 11.7 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and radio advertising; and (2) agency fees, creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, offline advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2003 primarily due to an increase in the frequency of television advertising associated with our new retail choice airline ticket service, continued advertising for our hotel service, creative talent and production costs for our new advertising campaign. Online advertising expenses consist primarily of banners, pop-ups, keyword searches, affiliate programs and e-mail advertisements. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, online advertising expenses increased over 2003 primarily due to the inclusion of the online advertising expenses of Travelweb and Active Hotels, which each rely primarily on online advertising to drive their respective businesses. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Sales and Marketing $ 32,091 $ 33,441 (4.0 )% % of Total Gross Profit 16.2 % 22.9 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; (3) provisions for credit card charge-backs; and (4) warrant costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The warrant charge related to the issuance of warrants to purchase priceline.com common stock to Marriott International, Inc. during the first quarter of 2003. There was no similar charge during 2004. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, sales and marketing expenses decreased over the same period in 2003 due to the one-time nature of the charge associated with the issuance of the warrant in 2003. Excluding the effect of the warrant charge of $6.6 million in 2003, sales and marketing expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, were almost entirely variable in nature and therefore increased over the same period in 2003, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as the inclusion of sales and marketing expenses associated with Travelweb and Active Hotels. 63 Personnel Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Personnel $ 35,574 $ 29,962 18.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 18.0 % 20.5 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, employee health benefits and stock based compensation. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2003 primarily due to additional salary expense resulting from the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels, as well as increases in performance-based employee bonuses. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 General and Administrative $ 16,452 $ 12,031 36.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 8.3 % 8.2 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals; (2) business insurance; and (3) occupancy expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the same period in 2003 due to additional fees for outside professionals, including those related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance and litigation activities. General and administrative expenses also increased as a result of the inclusion of Travelweb and Active Hotels. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Information Technology $ 9,171 $ 8,898 3.1 % % of Total Gross Profit 4.6 % 6.1 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, information technology expenses increased from the same period in 2003 primarily due to integration and related operating expenses resulting from the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. 64 Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Depreciation and Amortization $ 13,501 $ 11,533 17.1 % % of Total Gross Profit 6.8 % 7.9 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (2) depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and (4) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives primarily associated with the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels, partially offset by a decrease in the depreciable base of certain long-lived assets. Restructuring, Severance, and Special Charges In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $564,000. This restructuring charge resulted from a re-evaluation and refinement of our estimated real estate costs related to leased property vacated in connection with the 2002 and 2000 restructurings. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $4.7 million. This restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel businesses and a reduction in headcount. The repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel business. The charge relates primarily to severance payments, real estate costs and asset impairments. We estimate, based on current information available, the remaining net cash outflows associated with our restructuring related commitments will be paid in 2005. These restructuring accruals are recorded in “Accrued expenses” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Interest Income $ 5,112 $ 2,474 106.6 % Interest Expense (3,722 ) (907 ) 310.4 % Total $ 1,390 $ 1,567 (11.3 )% For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, net interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2003, primarily due to higher overall cash and investment balances. Interest income was partially offset by interest expense, including coupon interest and amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of our $125 million 65 aggregate principal amount 1% Convertible Senior Notes issued in August 2003, and our $100 million aggregate principal amount 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes issued in June 2004. Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2004 2003 Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests $ (511 ) $ 2,331 (121.9 )% Equity in loss of investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, represented our pro rata share of the net loss of Travelweb, prior to our acquisition of a majority of its equity in May and December 2004, and our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net income. The decrease in equity in income of investees was primarily due to (1) increases in interest rates which caused a slowdown in the refinancing activity by pricelinemortgage.com’s customers that pricelinemortgage.com benefited from throughout 2003, and (2) the settlement by pricelinemortgage.com, in the fourth quarter of 2004, of a patent infringement lawsuit and associated legal fees that negatively impact their 2004 operating results. Taxes For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an income tax benefit of $193,000. The benefit relates to a net foreign tax benefit related to the operations of Active Hotels in the U.K., partially offset by federal alternative minimum taxes related to income earned in the United States. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2005, we had $175.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Approximately $22.3 million is restricted cash on deposit collateralizing letters of credit issued in favor of certain suppliers and landlords. Also included in restricted cash are amounts held by our credit card processor. We generally invest excess cash to make such funds readily available for operating purposes. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of highly liquid, high quality, investment grade debt instruments. All of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter. This can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would indicate. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $62.6 million, resulting from net income of $192.7 million, less non-cash items of $124.2 million, and $5.9 million of changes in working capital. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2005, were primarily related to an $8.3 million increase in accounts receivable offset by a $1.7 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in revenues and timing of collections. Non-cash items were primarily associated with the deferred income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, primarily those acquired in our acquisitions of Travelweb, Active Hotels and Bookings. The deferred income tax benefit resulted primarily from the $171 million non-cash reversal of a portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, 66 was $42.0 million, resulting from net income of $31.5 million, non-cash items not affecting December 31, 2004 cash flows of $17.7 million, partially offset by $7.2 million of changes in working capital. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily related to a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable and a $4.4 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in revenues attributable to increased hotel, vacation package and rental car transactions. The decrease in accounts payable was related to seasonal decreases in deferred merchant bookings and accounts payable balances. Non-cash items were primarily associated with the depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, primarily those acquired in our acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and approximately $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we invested $135.2 million, net of cash acquired, in acquisitions, the substantial majority of which related to Bookings. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we invested $164.7 million, net of cash acquired, the substantial majority of which related to the acquisition of Active Hotels. Net redemptions of short-term investments of $50.5 million and $28.2 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, partially offset the use of funds for financing activities. In both years, net cash used in investing activities was also affected by purchases of property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2005, this amount was higher than previous periods due to increased spending on capitalized development activities, especially those related to the launch of our retail hotel service, purchases of computer hardware and the inclusion of capital spending by our newly acquired subsidiaries. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $13.2 and $107.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily the proceeds from the sale of our minority interest in subsidiary of $18.7 million and the exercise of employee stock options of $6.7 million, partially offset by $12.2 million used to repurchase warrants held by Marriott International, Inc. A majority of the proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2004 was provided by the issuance of $100 million of convertible senior notes and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $6.8 million. The following table represents the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than One Year Two to Three Years Four to Five Years After Five Years Operating lease obligations $ 19,214 $ 3,521 $ 6,791 $ 6,727 $ 2,175 Convertible debt(1) 237,045 3,500 131,295 102,250 — Series B mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (2) 13,470 — 13,470 — — Minority interest(3) 23,659 7,886 15,773 — — Total $ 293,388 $ 14,907 $ 167,329 $ 108,977 $ 2,175 (1) Assumes redemption of $125 million aggregate principal amount of 1% Senior Convertible Notes in August 2008 and $100 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Senior Convertible Notes in January 2010. Assumes no conversion of the Notes into common stock. The holders of the 1% and 2.25% notes may require us to repurchase the notes on August 1, 2008, and January 15, 2010, respectively. Also includes interest payable on the Notes. (2) Assumes no additional exercise of warrants and/or redemption of Redeemable Preferred stock during February 2007. 67 (3) Assumes holders of minority interests put their shares to us at the earliest possible date at the current carrying value (see Note 19 for terms of put provisions). Priceline.com leases office space in buildings in Norwalk, Connecticut; Cambridge England (Active Hotels); and Amsterdam, Netherlands (Bookings). These leases are accounted for as operating leases. The operating lease obligations represent the minimum payments for our operating leases. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 1% Notes and the 2.25% Notes in the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels in 2004, and in the acquisition of Bookings in 2005. The remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes, strategic uses and working capital requirements. Excluded from the table above are other long-term liabilities and letters of credit of approximately $10.7 million that were issued in favor of certain suppliers and landlords. The letters of credit expire between March 2006 and March 2007 and are generally subject to automatic renewal upon expiration of the letter of credit. Also excluded are employment agreements with certain members of senior management that provide for cash severance payments of approximately $10.3 million (which does not include the estimated value of such benefits as continuation of medical or dental benefits or the impact of excise tax gross-up). Our Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus an amount equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid, and is subject to mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007. In the event that we consummate certain business combination transactions, our Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed at our option or at the option of the holder at the liquidation preference per outstanding share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends and dividends that would have accrued through February 6, 2007. There were 13,470 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2005. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the rights and preferences of our Series B Preferred Stock. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future or that future borrowings or equity contributions will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, repay and debt or preferred stock or finance our business strategies. New Accounting Pronouncements As more fully discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we were required to adopt SFAS 123(R) as of January 1, 2006. SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on our Consolidated Statement of Operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants rather than disclose the pro forma impact on our consolidated operations within our footnotes. Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the impact of unvested stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2005 is estimated to increase personnel expense by approximately $6.0 million in 2006, $2.5 million in 2007 and $0.5 million in 2008. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest risk and forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk. The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to 68 mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2005. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2005, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future. As of December 31, 2005, the carrying value of our debt is approximately $223.6 million. We estimate that the fair market value of such debt was approximately $197 million as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we held an interest rate swap agreement on $45 million notional value of our fixed rate debt. The fair value cost to terminate this swap as of December 31, 2005 was approximately $1.5 million. A 10% adverse fluctuation in the 3-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2005, would increase the cost to terminate the interest rate swap by approximately $460,000. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability, or cash flow. As a result of our acquisitions of our European operations, we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States but report our results in U.S. dollars. As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The results of operations of our European operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our European operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our European operations are subject to risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. In 2005, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. As of December 31, 2005, there were no foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding. We may enter into additional forward contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by such changes.",2023-12-30 18:44:26.220449
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors.” Overview General. We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation packages, cruises and destination services. We offer our customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase travel services in a traditional, price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique Name Your Own Price® service, which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at discounted prices. At present, we derive substantially all of our revenues from the following sources: · Transaction revenues from our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car services, as well as our vacation packages service; · Commissions earned from the sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and other travel services; · Customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both Name Your Own Price® and price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars services; · Transaction revenue from our price-disclosed hotel room service; · Global distribution system (“GDS”) reservation booking fees related to both our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car services, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and · Other revenues derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites. Trends. The online sale of travel services has been one of the fastest growing sectors of the Internet since the late 1990s. While the online market for travel services continues to experience significant annualized growth, we believe that the domestic market share of third-party distributors, like priceline.com, has declined over the recent past and that the growth of the domestic online market for travel services has slowed. We believe the decline in market share is attributable, in part, to a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing. In addition, over the course of 2005 and 2006, airlines and hotel chains generally experienced year-over-year increases in load factors (a common metric that measures airplane customer usage) and occupancy rates (a common metric that measures hotel customer usage), respectively, which leaves them with less excess inventory to provide third party intermediaries like priceline.com. Notwithstanding these trends, we continue to believe that the market for online travel services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for growth, in particular, in certain international markets. Because we believe that an opportunity for growth exists in certain international markets, and since prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 substantially all of our revenue was generated in the U.S., we have taken steps to expand the markets we serve. In September 2004, we acquired Booking.com Limited (formerly known as Active Hotels Ltd.), a U.K. based online hotel service. Booking.com Limited gives 49 us a strong presence in the U.K.’s online hotel market. Furthermore, in July 2005, we acquired Amsterdam-based Booking.com B.V. (formerly known as Bookings B.V.), one of Europe’s leading Internet hotel reservation services, with offices primarily in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Loule, Paris, Rome and Vienna. All of our European operations, including Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V., are majority-owned by us. A minority interest in our European business is held by our European managers responsible for that business. We work with a range of chain-owned and independently owned hotels across Europe and in major cities around the world to provide hotel reservations on various websites in multiple languages. Our European operations represented approximately 40.6% of our gross bookings in the year ended December 31, 2006, and were a substantial contributor to our consolidated operating income during that period and we expect that throughout 2007 they will represent a growing percentage of our total gross bookings and operating income. As our European operations have become more meaningful contributors to our results, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in certain of our operating expenses and other financial metrics. For example, because our European operations utilize online affiliate and search marketing as principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our online advertising expense has increased significantly since our acquisition of those companies, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2007. In addition, and as discussed in more detail below, since the acquisitions of Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V., we have seen the effects of seasonal fluctuation on our results change as a result of different revenue recognition policies that apply to our European hotel service (as well as our domestic retail hotel service) and the increased importance of European hotel bookings to our results of operations. The financial prospects of our domestic business have been and continue to be significantly dependent upon the sale of leisure airline tickets and, as a result, the health of our domestic business has been directly related to the health of the airline industry. In recent years, most domestic airlines, and many of our major suppliers, experienced significant losses. Those losses were compounded by competition from low-cost carriers and high fuel prices. As a result of these and other factors, many of the major airlines deeply discounted retail airline tickets to maintain market share, simplified fare structures by removing restrictions associated with certain airline tickets and reduced their total capacity to increase load factors. Those actions had a detrimental effect on our overall airline business and, in particular, our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket service, which is negatively impacted by (1) increased load factors as airlines have less excess inventory to provide to third party intermediaries in general, and to lower yielding “opaque” services, in particular, like our Name Your Own Price® service, and (2) deep retail discounting because it hurts our value proposition and makes users less willing to accept the trade-offs associated with the Name Your Own Price® service, for what has become, in many cases, modest fare savings. We rely on fees paid to us by global distribution systems, or GDSs, for travel bookings made through GDSs for a portion of our gross profit and a substantial portion of our operating income. We rebate certain GDS costs to certain suppliers (e.g., airlines, hotels, etc.) in exchange for contractual considerations such as those relating to pricing and availability, and expect to continue to do so in the future. During 2006, most agreements between GDSs and the major domestic airlines expired, and most airlines have negotiated new agreements with reduced distribution costs for the airlines that went into effect September 1, 2006. The structure of these new agreements, along with airline pressure on third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to operate under the new structures, require us to reduce our aggregate compensation and book through lower cost channels to receive airlines’ full content and avoid airline service fees. We have entered into new agreements with a number of airlines to obtain access to airline content, and are in continuing discussions with others to obtain similar access. If we were denied access to airlines’ full content or had to incur service fees on our airline tickets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 50 Additionally, some travel suppliers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to develop technology to bypass the traditional GDSs, such as enabling direct connections to the travel suppliers or using alternative global distribution methods recently developed by new entrants to the global distribution marketplace, such as G2 Switchworks Corp. Such new entrants propose using technology that is less complex than traditional global distribution systems, and that enables the distribution of airline tickets in a manner that is more cost-effective to the airline suppliers. To this end, in the first quarter 2006, we entered into agreements with Sabre Inc. and G2 Switchworks for the provision of GDS services. Development of the technology to connect to such alternative GDSs, or to enable direct connections to travel suppliers, requires the use of information technology resources and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses, increase the frequency/duration of system problems and delay other projects. Furthermore, our contractual obligations to Worldspan, L.P. may limit our ability to pursue the most financially attractive GDS options during the term of our agreement with Worldspan, L.P., which expires December 31, 2007. As a result of the continued decline in sales of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets over the last several years, we have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify our revenue among “non-opaque” services, such as allowing our customers to purchase price-disclosed retail airline, hotel, rental car and other travel services, which we believe will help broaden our customer appeal. We intend to continue to execute on our strategy of diversifying our service offerings and markets, through both continued internal development of services and, if appropriate, acquisitions. As a result of the diversification described above, the growth rates for our “agency” businesses, which are generally comprised of our price-disclosed retail services, have, over the recent past, significantly exceeded the growth rates for our “merchant” businesses, which are comprised primarily of our slower-growing Name Your Own Price® services. We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our leisure travel business, to continue to promote the priceline.com brand and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease; natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes; terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East or elsewhere; or the liquidation of major domestic airlines now in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or the withdrawal from our system of a major airline (or the consolidation of our major airline suppliers) or hotel supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability. Seasonality. Prior to introducing a retail travel option to our customers, substantially all of our business was conducted under the Name Your Own Price® system and accordingly, because those services are non-refundable in nature, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking was generated. However, we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel services, including our European operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel. As a result, a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized until future quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in 51 which bookings are generated. Therefore, as our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors. Recent Accounting Pronouncements. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted SFAS 123(R) as of January 1, 2006. SFAS 123(R) had a significant impact on our Consolidated Statement of Operations as we are required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants rather than disclose the pro forma impact on our consolidated operations within our footnotes. Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the impact of unvested stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2005 increased personnel expense by approximately $6.1 million in 2006, and is estimated to increase personnel expense by approximately $2.4 million in 2007 and $0.6 million in 2008. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” FIN 48 applies to all tax positions and clarifies the recognition of tax benefits in the financial statements by providing for a two-step approach of recognition and measurement. The first step involves assessing whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based upon its technical merits. The second step involves measurement of the amount to recognize. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate finalization with the taxing authority. FIN 48 became effective on January 1, 2007. Management does not believe that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management, including the following: · Merchant Revenues and Merchant Cost of Revenues Name Your Own Price® Services: Merchant revenues and related cost of revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our customers, selecting suppliers, remitting payments to our suppliers and determining the price we will accept from the customer. We recognize such revenue and costs if and when we accept and fulfill the customer’s non-refundable offer. Merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include the selling price and cost, respectively, of the travel services and are reported on a gross basis. Pursuant to the terms of our hotel service, our hotel suppliers are permitted to bill us for the underlying cost of the service during a specified period of time. In the event that we are not billed by our hotel supplier within the specified time period, we reduce our cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts. 52 Merchant Price-Disclosed Hotel Service: Merchant revenues for our merchant price-disclosed hotel service are derived from transactions where customers use our service to purchase hotel rooms from hotel suppliers at rates which are subject to contractual arrangements. Charges are billed to customers at the time of booking and are included in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer completes his or her stay. Such amounts are generally refundable upon cancellation prior to stay, subject to cancellation penalties in certain cases. Merchant revenues and accounts payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at the conclusion of the customer’s stay at the hotel. We record the difference between the selling price and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue. · Agency Revenues and Cost of Revenues. Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the products sold are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. Such revenues are recognized at the conclusion of the customer’s travel. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and the age of commissions receivable. · Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance. As required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Based upon management’s assessment of positive and negative evidence, we recorded non-cash tax benefits in 2006 and 2005 of $28.1 million and $170.5 million, respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. We believe that it is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized and, accordingly, a valuation allowance against those assets remains. The valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change. · Accounting for State and Local “Hotel Occupancy” Taxes. As discussed in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, several jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against several on-line travel companies, including us, alleging among other things, that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by a customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room. Historically, we have not collected taxes on this differential. Additional state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively, or both. To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have additional tax exposures. We will continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposures, and to the extent appropriate, we reserve for those estimated liabilities. 53 · Airline Debit Memos. Our airline suppliers periodically send us debit memos that make claims for additional amounts due to them related to the cost of airline tickets we sold on their behalf. We process the debit memos received and, when appropriate, make payments to the airlines. Based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with the airlines, we establish reserves for estimated losses when appropriate resulting from these claims. · Allowance for Credit Card Charge-backs. Because we act as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs. · Valuation of Goodwill. We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired including Booking.com B.V., Booking.com Limited, Travelweb and priceline.com europe Ltd. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded. · Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. · Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense over the service period based upon the grant date fair value of equity-based grants. We estimate forfeiture rates in determining the amount of compensation to record. In addition, we record stock-based compensation expense for grants that include a performance contingency based upon the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period. We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted, or when the probable outcome for performance-based shares is updated based upon changes in facts and circumstances. · Equity Investments. We have, among other investments, a 49% equity interest in pricelinemortgage.com and, accordingly, recognize our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s operating results, not to exceed an amount that we believe represents the investment’s estimated fair value. The carrying value of the investment at December 31, 2006 was $9.5 million. We periodically test this investment for impairment using a number of assumptions and estimates. In the event that future circumstances indicate that our investment in pricelinemortgage.com is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded. 54 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Operating Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers. The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold through our websites and the related gross bookings were as follows: Year Ended Gross Bookings Airline Tickets Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days December 31, 2006 $ 3.3 billion 2.8 million 18.7 million 7.5 million December 31, 2005 $ 2.2 billion 2.8 million 11.8 million 5.8 million Gross bookings increased by 49.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005. The increase was driven primarily by an increase of 85.6% in “agency” bookings for the year ended December 31, 2006, which was primarily attributable to (1) growth in our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively; (2) an increase in the average fare of our retail ticket service, and (3) the increased sale of retail rental cars. Merchant gross bookings increased by 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in merchant gross bookings relating to our domestic retail hotel service, an increase in the average daily rate of our Name Your Own Price® hotel service and an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® rental car days. Airline tickets sold increased by 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in 2005. The increase in the number of airline tickets sold in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005, was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Hotel room nights sold increased by 58.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in 2005. The increase in the number of hotel room nights sold in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005, was primarily due to growth in our hotel room nights sold through (1) our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and (2) our domestic retail hotel service. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights. Our retail hotel service benefited from the enhanced integration of our retail and Name Your Own Price® services in the first quarter of 2006. We believe that the benefit to our retail hotel service came partially at the expense of sales of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights during the year ended December 31, 2006, as some amount of demand that may otherwise have been directed to the Name Your Own Price® service instead was directed to our retail hotel service. 55 Rental car days sold increased by 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in 2005, due to increases in sales of both our retail and Name Your Own Price® rental car services, which benefited from the launch of enhanced integration of retail and Name Your Own Price® services in the first quarter 2006, as well as from the launch of new features in 2005, including options for one-way destination and off-airport car rentals. Revenues We classify our revenue into three categories: · Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our customers, selecting suppliers and remitting payments to our suppliers. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotels; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions. · Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. · Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our airline ticket business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of merchant (“opaque”) Name Your Own Price® travel services to a business that includes the sale of retail, price-disclosed travel services. Because merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services are reported on a “gross” basis and retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Additionally, our European operations contributed approximately $182.7 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, which are primarily recorded on a “net” basis. 56 Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Merchant Revenues $ 904,169 $ 859,404 5.2 % Agency Revenues 213,900 99,051 116.0 % Other Revenues 5,034 4,205 19.7 % Total Revenues $ 1,123,103 $ 962,660 16.7 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 5.2% compared to the same period in 2005, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® rental car days, Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, and vacation packages. A substantial portion of the increase was due to services sold through our agreement with Orbitz, which we entered into on January 1, 2006. Under our agreement with Orbitz, we paid fees in exchange for a link on the Orbitz website that directed traffic to the Name Your Own Price® service. The agreement expired on December 31, 2006. While the Orbitz agreement provided us with a good source of traffic, we believe it was likely dilutive in that many of the customers that we paid Orbitz for may have purchased our travel services anyway. While the expiration of the Orbitz agreement may result in decreased merchant volume in 2007 — we estimate potentially up to approximately 5% of our 2007 merchant volume after taking into account estimated dilution - it frees up marketing dollars that we may use in other online channels. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 116% compared to the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of (1) growth in our European operations, which contributed $179 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006, and $67 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005; and (2) increased sales of domestic retail hotel room nights and retail rental car days. Results from our European operations are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 19.7%, compared to the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenue related to the inclusion of results of operation from our online advertising company since it was acquired in June 2006. 57 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Cost of Merchant Revenues $ 722,004 $ 694,190 4.0 % % of Merchant Revenues 79.9 % 80.8 % Cost of Agency Revenues — 607 (100.0 %) % of Agency Revenues 0.0 % 0.6 % Cost of Other Revenues — — — % of Other Revenues — — Total Cost of Revenues $ 722,004 $ 694,797 3.9 % % of Revenues 64.3 % 72.2 % Cost of Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2006, cost of revenues increased 3.9%, compared to the same period in 2005, due primarily to the fact that merchant revenues increased comparably in the same period. Cost of revenues entirely reflect merchant Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue while retail transactions are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Cost of Merchant Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2006, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; and (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes. Cost of merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 4.0%, compared to the same period in 2005, due primarily to the fact that merchant revenues increased comparably in the same period. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues are recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of Agency Revenues Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquisition activity. 58 Cost of Other Revenues For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no costs of other revenues. Gross Profit Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by 49.7% compared to the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1) our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively; and (2) increased sales of retail hotel room nights. The contribution to gross profit from airline ticket sales during the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by a decrease in net GDS fees per ticket as compared to the same period in 2005, which contributed to lower margins on retail ticket sales in particular. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005, because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to retail, price-disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Merchant Gross Profit $ 182,165 $ 165,214 10.3 % Merchant Gross Margin 20.1 % 19.2 % Agency Gross Profit 213,900 98,444 117.3 % Agency Gross Margin 100.0 % 99.4 % Other Gross Profit 5,034 4,205 19.7 % Other Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Total Gross Profit $ 401,099 $ 267,863 49.7 % Total Gross Margin 35.7 % 27.8 % Merchant Gross Profit Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, merchant gross profit increased from the same period in 2005, primarily due to an increase in the sale of domestic merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights and Name Your Own Price® rental car days. The contribution to merchant gross profit from Name Your Own Price® airline ticket sales during the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by a decrease in net GDS fees per ticket as compared to the same period in 2005. A substantial portion of the increase in merchant gross profit was due to services sold through our agreement with Orbitz, as discussed above. Our agreement with Orbitz expired on December 31, 2006. Merchant gross margin increased primarily because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in the year ended December 31, 2006, when compared to merchant price-disclosed hotel transactions, which are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. 59 Agency Gross Profit Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which are recorded net of agency costs, if any. For the year ended December 31, 2006, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of (1) growth in our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively; and (2) increased sales of retail hotel room nights and rental car days. Other Gross Profit During the year ended December 31, 2006, other gross profit increased from the same period in 2005 primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues related to including results of operations from our online advertising company since it was acquired in June 2006. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Offline Advertising $ 31,831 $30,957 2.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 7.9 % 11.6 % Online Advertising $ 113,822 $58,535 94.5 % % of Total Gross Profit 28.4 % 21.9 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, radio and print advertising; and (2) agency fees, the cost for creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials. For the year ended December 31, 2006, offline advertising expenses were slightly higher than in the same period in 2005. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail advertisements. For the year ended December 31, 2006, online advertising expenses increased significantly over the same period in 2005, primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses related to (1) supporting the growth of our European operations, which rely primarily on online advertising to drive their businesses and (2) an increase in our domestic online advertising, including fees paid pursuant to our agreement with Orbitz. 60 Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Sales and Marketing $ 42,119 $ 34,295 22.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 10.5 % 12.8 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks. For the year ended December 31, 2006, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2005, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes. Personnel Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Personnel $ 79,421 $ 49,659 59.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 19.8 % 18.5 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2006, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2005, primarily due to increased personnel expenses associated with head count growth of our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, increased employee performance bonus expense and an increase in stock-based compensation due mainly to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, which requires companies to record non-cash compensation expense related to stock-based awards granted to employees. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $14.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006, and approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) General and Administrative $ 28,587 $ 20,881 36.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 7.1 % 7.8 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) business insurance. General and 61 administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period during 2005, due to increased general and administrative expenses associated with the growth of our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and additional fees for outside professionals and expenses related to pending litigation. This increase was partially offset by the one-time receipt of certain franchise tax credits from the state of Connecticut in the amount of approximately $1.7 million. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Information Technology $ 9,749 $ 10,622 (8.2 )% % of Total Gross Profit 2.4 % 4.0 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the year ended December 31, 2006, information technology expenses decreased domestically from the same period in 2005, in part due to efficiencies resulting from the integration of Travelweb’s operations. This decrease was partially offset by increased information technology expenses associated with our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Depreciation and Amortization $ 33,449 $ 25,366 31.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 8.3 % 9.5 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2006, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of increased non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. 62 Restructuring Charge (Reversal), net Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Restructuring Charge (Reversal), net $ 135 $ 1,664 (91.9 %) In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $135,000 related to vacated leased property. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a net restructuring charge of approximately $1.7 million, consisting of a $2 million restructuring charge related to vacated leased property and a $336,000 restructuring reversal related to estimated costs to complete certain restructuring activities in Europe. Interest Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Interest Income $ 11,312 $ 5,550 103.8 % Interest Expense (7,060 ) (5,075 ) 39.1 % Total $ 4,252 $ 475 795.2 % For the year ended December 31, 2006, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2005, primarily due to higher prevailing interest rates and significantly higher cash balances in the fourth quarter of 2006. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the same period in 2005, due primarily to an increase in debt balances in 2006, as well as an increase in prevailing interest rates on the variable portion of the interest rate swap agreement related to our 1% Convertible Senior Notes. Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Income Tax Benefit $ 12,388 $ 156,277 (92.1 %) Income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 differs from the expected tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% because it includes benefits amounting to $28.1 million and $170.5 million, respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Other items resulting in a difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate include the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt, and lower foreign tax rates, partly offset by state income taxes. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Netherlands enacted a reduction in its statutory tax rate from 29.6% to 25.5%, effective January 1, 2007. We recognized a benefit of $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulting from the impact on deferred taxes of the Netherlands tax 63 rate reduction. Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income tax for the foreseeable future. We expect to make cash payments for U.S. alternative minimum tax and for certain international taxes. Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change ($000) Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests $ (3,554 ) $ 749 (574.5 %) Equity in income (loss) of investees and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, represented (1) minority interests associated with the ownership of priceline.com International that is held by certain managers of that business; and (2) equity in income (loss) of investees, principally comprised of our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results. The change in equity in income of investees and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the minority interest in the earnings of priceline.com International and a decrease in earnings of and an impairment charge recorded for our investment in pricelinemortgage.com. Due to recent losses incurred by pricelinemortgage.com, we reviewed the carrying value of our investment for impairment. Based upon recent operating results and future projected results, we determined that our investment was impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. Accordingly, in the third quarter, we recognized a charge of $1.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our equity investment in pricelinemortgage.com to its estimated fair value. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Operating Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers. The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold through our websites and the related gross bookings were as follows: Year Ended Gross Bookings Airline Tickets Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days December 31, 2005 $2.2 billion 2.8 million 11.8 million 5.8 million December 31, 2004 $1.7 billion 2.8 million 7.8 million 5.1 million Gross bookings increased by 32.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004. The increase was driven primarily by an increase of 81.6% in “agency” bookings for the 64 year ended December 31, 2005, which was primarily attributable to (1) the inclusion of approximately $468 million of gross bookings from our European operations; (2) the increased sale of retail airline tickets; (3) the inclusion of agency gross bookings relating to our retail hotel service launched in March 2005; and (4) the increased sale of retail rental cars. Merchant gross bookings increased by 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel bookings, mostly offset by a decrease in the sale of opaque airline tickets. Airline tickets sold decreased by 0.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005, over the same period in 2004. The decrease in the number of airline tickets sold in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily attributable to a significant percentage decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, largely offset by an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets. Hotel room nights sold increased by 51.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005, over the same period in 2004. The increase in the number of hotel room nights sold in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to the inclusion of hotel room nights sold through our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V., which were acquired in the third quarters of 2004 and 2005, respectively, and our merchant price-disclosed hotel service, which was integrated after our acquisition of Travelweb during the second quarter 2004. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, in part due to the increased focus on our website of our merchant price-disclosed hotel service. Rental car days sold increased by 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005, over the same period in 2004 due to increases in sales of our opaque rental car service, increases in sales of our retail rental car service, which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2004, and the launch of new features, including options for one-way destination and off-airport car rentals. Revenues We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our airline ticket business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of merchant (“opaque”) Name Your Own Price® travel services to a business that includes the sale of retail, price-disclosed travel services. Because merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services are reported on a “gross” basis and retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Additionally, our European operations contributed approximately $70 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenues generated by our European operations are primarily recorded on a “net” basis. 65 Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change ($000) Merchant Revenues $ 859,404 $ 872,994 (1.6 %) Agency Revenues 99,051 38,601 156.6 % Other Revenues 4,205 2,777 51.4 % Total Revenues $ 962,660 $ 914,372 5.3 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased by 1.6%, compared to the same period in 2004 due to a substantial percentage decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, which was partially offset by an increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel bookings. We believe that the decrease in the number of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets sold continued to be due primarily to low retail airline ticket prices and the availability of retail tickets on our website. In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade­offs associated with our Name Your Own Price® airline service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel services at the lower retail rates, or from “low-cost” carriers, without having to make any trade-offs. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased 157%, compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of (1) the inclusion of approximately $67 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005, from our European operations; and (2) increased sales of retail airline tickets, hotels and rental cars, partially offset by a decrease in Worldspan, L.P. GDS fees. Results from our European operations consist of a full year of operations from Booking.com Limited, which was acquired in September 2004, and approximately six months of operations from Booking.com B.V., which was acquired in July 2005. Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenue. 66 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change ($000) Cost of Merchant Revenues $ 694,190 $ 714,822 (2.9 %) % of Merchant Revenues 80.8 % 81.9 % Cost of Agency Revenues 607 1,395 (56.5 %) % of Agency Revenues 0.6 % 3.6 % Cost of Other Revenues — — — % of Other Revenues — — Total Cost of Revenues $ 694,797 $ 716,217 (3.0 %) % of Revenues 72.2 % 78.3 % Cost of Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2005, cost of revenues decreased by 3.0%, compared to the same period in 2004, due primarily to a shift in the mix of revenue from merchant services toward agency services that have higher gross margins. Merchant Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions as compared to retail transactions which are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Cost of Merchant Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2005, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (4) non-cash acquisition-related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of Travelweb. Cost of merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased by 2.9%, compared to the same period in 2004, due primarily to a decrease in overall merchant revenues. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues are recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of Agency Revenues Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with our recent acquisitions. 67 Cost of Other Revenues For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no costs of other revenues. Gross Profit Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by 35.2% compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1) the inclusion of results from our European operations which consist of a full year of operations from Booking.com Limited which was acquired in September 2004, and approximately six months of operations from Booking.com B.V., which was acquired in July 2005; and (2) increased sales of retail travel services. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to agency and merchant price-disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, merchant gross profit increased from the same period in 2004, primarily due to the inclusion of gross profit relating to our merchant price-disclosed hotel service and growth in our Name Your Own Price® rental car service, partially offset by a substantial decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Merchant gross margin increased primarily because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in the year ended December 31, 2005, when compared to merchant price-disclosed hotel transactions, which are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. 68 Agency Gross Profit Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which are recorded net of agency costs, if any.

GDS fees. Other Gross Profit During the year ended December 31, 2005, other gross profit increased from the same period in 2004 primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 ($000) Offline Advertising $ 30,957 $ 33,476 (7.5 %) % of Total Gross Profit 11.6 % 16.9 % Online Advertising $ 58,535 $ 27,480 113.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 21.9 % 13.9 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with television and radio advertising; and (2) agency fees, the cost for creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2004, primarily due to the inclusion of the online advertising expenses related to our European operations and our merchant price-disclosed hotel service, each of which relies primarily on online advertising to drive its business.

Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 ($000) Depreciation and Amortization $ 25,366 $ 13,501 87.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 9.5 % 6.8 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2005, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of the inclusion of non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with our European operations. Restructuring Charge (Reversal), net Year Ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 ($000) Restructuring Charge (Reversal), net $ 1,664 $ (12 ) NM In 2005, we recorded a net restructuring charge of $1.7 million, comprised of a $2.0 million charge based upon a re-evaluation of the estimated costs related to leased property originally vacated in 2000, partly offset by a $0.3 million reversal based upon a re-evaluation of estimated costs to complete certain European restructuring activities. 71 Interest Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change ($000) Interest Income $ 5,550 $ 5,112 8.6 % Interest Expense (5,075 ) (3,722 ) 36.4 % Total $ 475 $ 1,390 (65.8 %) For the year ended December 31, 2005, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2004, primarily due to higher prevailing interest rates. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2005 over the same period in 2004 because our 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes issued in June 2004 were outstanding for the entire twelve month period in 2005. Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $156 million. This principally resulted from a non-cash tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2005 of $171 million, relating to the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The non-cash tax benefit was recorded pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, that require a company to release a portion of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not that it will realize all or some portion of its deferred tax assets. Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income for the foreseeable future. As a result of the reversal, we recorded a mostly non-cash $12.5 million provision for U.S. income tax expense in our Consolidated Financial Statements in 2005, and will continue to record a non-cash provision for U.S. income tax expense in future periods. This non-cash U.S. income tax provision will materially negatively impact net income and earnings per share in subsequent periods as compared to prior periods. We expect to make cash tax payments for U.S. alternative minimum taxes and for certain international taxes. Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change ($000) Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests $ 749 ($511 ) 246.6 % Equity in income of investees and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, represented (1) our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results, (2) minority interests associated with the 8.5% ownership of priceline.com International that is held by certain managers of that business and (3) until May 2004, our pro rata share of Travelweb’s net results. The increase in equity in income of investees and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to increases in equity 72 in income of investees related to (1) our equity in the increase in pricelinemortgage.com’s net income in both periods and (2) the exclusion of our equity in the net loss of Travelweb subsequent to our acquisition of Travelweb in May 2004. This increase was partially offset by the inclusion of the aforementioned minority interests in priceline.com International. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2006, we had $431.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We generally invest excess cash to make such funds readily available for operating purposes. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of highly liquid, high quality, investment grade debt instruments. All of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter. This can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would indicate. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $112.1 million, resulting from net income of $74.5 million, non-cash items not affecting 2006 cash flows of $32.7 million and $4.9 million of positive changes in working capital. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2006, were primarily related to a $27.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by an $21.2 million increase in accounts receivable. The increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable were primarily due to an increase in merchant bookings in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased primarily due to an $8.2 million increase in bonus accruals and a $5.0 million increase in on-line advertising accruals. Non-cash items were primarily associated with the deferred income tax benefit, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization. The non-cash deferred income tax benefit resulted primarily from the $28.1 million reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax valuation allowance. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $62.6 million, resulting from net income of $192.7 million, less non-cash items of $124.2 million, and $5.9 million of changes in working capital. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2005, were primarily related to an $8.3 million increase in accounts receivable offset by a $1.7 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in revenues and timing of collections. Non-cash items were primarily associated with the deferred income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. The deferred income tax benefit resulted primarily from the $171 million non-cash reversal of a portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance. Net cash provided by investing activities was $68.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investing activities were affected by $64.9 million of net redemptions of short-term investments for the year ended December 31, 2006. Restricted cash decreased by $19.9 million in 2006 as we are no longer required to collateralize outstanding letters of credit with restricted cash balances. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, due primarily to the acquisition of Booking.com B.V. and purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by net redemptions of short-term investments of $50.5 million. Cash invested in purchases of property and equipment was $12.9 million and $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $157.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily related to the issuance of $345 million of senior convertible notes and $14.1 million of 73 proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by $135.8 million of treasury stock purchases, $9.1 million of debt issuance costs, $37.4 million for the purchase of conversion spread hedges and the purchase of $19.8 million of stock in priceline.com International held by minority interest shareholders. Net cash provided by financing activities of $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily proceeds from the sale of our minority interest in subsidiary and the exercise of employee stock options. As more fully discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2006, the total aggregate minority interest in priceline.com International on a fully diluted basis was approximately 6.4%. The aggregate fair value of the remaining minority interest in priceline.com International is estimated to be approximately $62.7 million at December 31, 2006, including unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units. We expect the future fair value of the minority interest to grow based upon expected continued strong performance of the European business. The following table represents the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006 (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than One Year One to Three Years Three to Five Years More than Five Years Operating lease obligations $ 21,629 $ 4,292 $ 8,723 $ 6,384 $ 2,230 Convertible debt (1) 591,114 5,656 134,542 276,475 174,441 Series B mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (2) 13,470 13,470 — — — Minority interest (3) 62,739 37,720 25,019 — — Total $ 688,952 $ 61,138 $ 168,284 $ 282,859 $ 176,671 (1) Assumes redemption of (a) $125 million aggregate principal amount of 1% Senior Convertible Notes in August 2008, (b) $100 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Senior Convertible Notes in January 2010, (c) $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% Senior Convertible Notes in September 2011, and (d) $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Senior Convertible Notes in September 2013. Assumes no early conversion or call of the aforementioned notes. The Notes become convertible if certain specified conditions are met, including if our stock price exceeds contingent conversion levels for a specified period. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, the closing price of our common stock has exceeded the contingent conversion prices for our notes. If the closing price exceeds the contingent conversion prices for 20 days in the specified conversion periods some or all of our convertible notes would become convertible at the holder’s option requiring us to classify the related outstanding debt balance as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet. The holders of the 1% and 2.25% notes may also require us to repurchase the notes on August 1, 2008, and January 15, 2010, respectively. The amounts also include interest payable on the Notes. (2) On January 12, 2007, Delta exercised warrants to purchase 756,199 shares of our common stock by surrendering 13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, representing all of the remaining outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock. 74 (3) Assumes holders of minority interests put their shares to us at the earliest possible date based upon the estimated fair value at December 31, 2006 (see Note 17 for terms of put provisions). Priceline.com leases office space in buildings in Norwalk, Connecticut; Cambridge England (Booking.com Limited); and Amsterdam, Netherlands (Booking.com B.V.). These leases are accounted for as operating leases. The operating lease obligations represent the minimum payments for our operating leases. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes to purchase the Conversion Spread Hedges and to repurchase 3.85 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $129.6 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 1% Notes and the 2.25% Notes in the acquisitions of Travelweb and Booking.com Limited in 2004, and in the acquisition of Booking.com B.V. in July 2005. The remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes, strategic uses and working capital requirements. Excluded from the table above are other long-term liabilities and letters of credit of approximately $14.5 million that were issued in favor of certain suppliers and landlords. The letters of credit expire between March 2007 and March 2008 and are generally subject to automatic renewal upon expiration of the letter of credit. Also excluded are employment agreements with certain members of senior management that provide for cash severance payments of approximately $15 million (which does not include the estimated value of such benefits as continuation of medical or dental benefits or the impact of excise tax gross-up). Our Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus an amount equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid, and is subject to mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007. There were 13,470 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2006. These shares were tendered as consideration for the exercise price for warrants to purchase our common stock by Delta Airlines, Inc. on January 12, 2007, and as a result, there are no longer any shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of that date. Our outstanding senior convertible notes become convertible if certain specified conditions are met; including if our stock price exceeds contingent conversion levels for a specified conversion period (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Subsequent to December 31, 2006, the closing price of our common stock has exceeded the contingent conversion prices for our notes. If the closing price exceeds the contingent conversion prices for 20 days in the specified 30 day conversion periods some or all of our convertible notes would become convertible at the holder’s option requiring us to classify the related outstanding debt balance as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet. We believe it is highly unlikely that a significant portion of the notes would be converted prior to maturity because the market value of the notes exceeds the value that holders would receive upon conversion. However, if holders elect to convert, we would likely fund the repayment with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, common stock issuances and/ or additional borrowings. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue growth or sustained 75 profitability will be realized or that future borrowings or equity sales will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest risk and forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk. The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2006. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2006, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future. As of December 31, 2006, the carrying value of our debt is approximately $568.9 million. We estimate that the fair market value of such debt was approximately $692.3 million as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we held an interest rate swap agreement on $45 million notional value of our fixed rate debt. The fair value cost to terminate this swap as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $1.2 million. A 10% adverse fluctuation in the 3-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2006, would increase the cost to terminate the interest rate swap by approximately $293,000. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate sensitive derivative instrument would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying debt. As a result of the acquisitions of our European operations, we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with Euros and British pounds as their functional currency. As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our European operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our European operations are subject to risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to, differing 76 economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. In 2006 and 2005, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. As of December 31, 2006, contracts with notional values of 17.6 million Euros were outstanding to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. There were no foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2005. We may enter into additional forward contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by such changes.",2023-12-30 18:44:22.755065
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors.” Overview General. We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation packages, cruises and destination services. In the United States, we offer our customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase travel services in a traditional, price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique Name Your Own Price® service, which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at discounted prices. Internationally, we offer our customers hotel room reservations in 60 countries and 22 languages. We launched our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to include, among others, the brands Booking.com and Active Hotels in Europe and Agoda in Asia. Our goal is to be the leading worldwide online hotel reservation service and be the top online discount travel agent in the United States. At present, we derive substantially all of our revenues from the following sources: · Transaction revenues from our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car services, as well as our vacation packages service; · Commissions earned from the sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and other travel services; · Customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both Name Your Own Price® and price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars services. Priceline eliminated processing fees for its price-disclosed airline ticket service in June 2007; · Transaction revenue from our price-disclosed merchant hotel room service; · Global distribution system (“GDS”) reservation booking fees related to both our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car services, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and · Other revenues derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites. Over the last several years, our business has transitioned from one driven primarily by domestic results to one driven primarily by international results. Prior to 2004, substantially all of our revenues were generated within the United States. In September 2004, we acquired Booking.com Limited, a U.K.-based online hotel service, in July 2005, we acquired Booking.com B.V., a Netherlands-based online hotel service, and in November 2007, we acquired Agoda Company, Ltd. (“Agoda”) and AGIP LLC (“AGIP,” and together with Agoda, the “Agoda Companies”), an online hotel service with operations in Singapore and Thailand. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our international business — the significant majority of which is currently generated by our European operations — represented approximately 55% of our gross bookings, and contributed more than two-thirds of our consolidated operating income during that period. We expect that throughout 2008 and beyond, our international business will represent a growing percentage of our total gross bookings and operating income. 46 International Trends. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have trailed those of the United States. However, international consumers are rapidly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed the growth rates within the United States. In addition, the base of hotel suppliers in Europe is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. We believe these trends have enabled us to become the top hotel service provider in Europe, and will allow us to successfully expand our service offerings internationally beyond Europe. As our international operations have become significant contributors to our results and international hotel bookings have become of increased importance to our earnings, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in certain of our operating expenses and other financial metrics. For example, because our international operations utilize online affiliate and search marketing as the principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our online advertising expense has increased significantly since our acquisition of those companies, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2008 and beyond. In addition, and as discussed in more detail below, since the acquisitions of Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V., we have seen the effects of seasonal fluctuations on our operating results change as a result of different revenue recognition policies that apply to our price-disclosed services (including our international hotel service) as compared to our Name Your Own Price® services. Another impact of the growing importance that our international operations represent to our business is our increased exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Because we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States and are reporting our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. Our international operations contributed approximately $372.6 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, which compares to $182.7 million for the same period in 2006. Approximately $30.3 million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. Domestic Trends. While the online market for travel services continues to experience significant annualized growth, we believe that the domestic market share of third-party distributors, like priceline.com, has declined over the recent past and that the growth of the domestic online market for travel services has slowed. We believe the decline in market share is attributable, in part, to a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing. In addition, airlines and hotel chains have generally experienced year-over-year increases in load factors (a common metric that measures airplane customer usage) and occupancy rates (a common metric that measures hotel customer usage), respectively, which leaves them with less excess supply to provide third party intermediaries like priceline.com. Recent decreases in domestic airline capacity could further reduce the amount of airline tickets available to us. Notwithstanding these trends, we continue to believe that the market for domestic online travel services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for growth. The financial prospects of our domestic business have historically been significantly dependent upon the sale of leisure airline tickets and, as a result, the health of our domestic business has been impacted by the health of the airline industry. While the sale of leisure airline tickets remains an important part of our business, revenue earned in connection with the domestic reservation of hotel room nights has come to represent a substantial majority of our domestic gross profit. The domestic hotel 47 market has been characterized in recent years by robust demand and limited supply, leading to increased occupancy rates, and in turn, increased average daily rates (“ADRs”). Because our remuneration for agency hotel transactions increases proportionately with room price, increased ADRs generally have a positive effect on our agency hotel business. Higher ADRs, however, can also negatively affect consumer demand, and higher occupancy rates can lead hotels to restrict our access to merchant hotel availability, particularly in high occupancy destinations popular with our travel base. Higher occupancy rates also have historically tended to drive lower margins as hotel suppliers have less need to distribute through third-party intermediaries such as us. Recently, significant attention has been given to the state of the United States economy and concern has been expressed regarding certain recessionary trends. We do not believe that our 2007 financial results were impacted by a slowdown in the United States economy, and we believe that our brands and services are attractive to consumers and suppliers in times of economic stress. There can be no assurance, however, that our business would not be adversely affected if current economic conditions continue or worsen. We also rely on fees paid to us by global distribution systems, or GDSs, for travel bookings made through GDSs for a portion of our gross profit and a substantial portion of our operating income. Connectivity to a GDS does not guarantee us access to the content of a travel supplier such as an airline or hotel company. We have agreements with a number of suppliers to obtain access to content, and are in continuing discussions with others to obtain similar access. If we were denied access to a suppliers’ full content or had to incur service fees in order to access or book such content, our results could suffer. We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our hotel business, to continue to promote the priceline.com brand in the United States, the Booking.com brand internationally, the Agoda brand in Asia and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into other international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease; natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes; terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East or elsewhere; or the withdrawal from our system of a major hotel supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we currently do not have operations in geographic areas such as South America, and therefore may consider strategic alternatives in those areas. Our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability. Seasonality. Our Name Your Own Price® services are non-refundable in nature, and accordingly, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking is generated. However, we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel services, including our international operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel. As a result, a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized as revenue until future quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which bookings are generated. Therefore, as our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors. 48 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management, including the following: · Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance. As required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Based upon management’s assessment of positive and negative evidence, we recorded non-cash tax benefits in 2007, 2006 and 2005 of $47.9 million, $28.1 million and $170.5 million, respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. We believe that it is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized and, accordingly, a valuation allowance against those assets remains. The valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change. · Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense over the service period based upon the grant date fair value of equity-based grants. We estimate forfeiture rates in determining the amount of compensation to record. In addition, we record stock-based compensation expense for grants that include a performance contingency based upon the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period. We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted, or when the probable outcome for performance-based shares is updated based upon changes in facts and circumstances. · Accounting for State and Local “Hotel Occupancy” Taxes. As discussed in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, several jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against several on-line travel companies, including us, alleging among other things, that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by a customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room. Historically, we have not collected taxes on this differential. Additional state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively, or both. To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have additional tax exposures. We will continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposures, and to the extent appropriate, we reserve for those estimated liabilities. 49 · Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Because we act as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs. In addition, in connection with hotel agency transactions, we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and the age of commissions receivable. · Valuation of Goodwill. We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired including Booking.com B.V., Booking.com Limited, Travelweb, the Agoda Companies and priceline.com europe Ltd. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded. · Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. · Airline Debit Memos. Our airline suppliers periodically send us debit memos that make claims for additional amounts due to them related to the cost of airline tickets we sold on their behalf. We process the debit memos received and, when appropriate, make payments to the airlines. Based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with the airlines, we establish reserves for estimated losses when appropriate resulting from these claims. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Operating Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings for our international brands and operations, and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings by our domestic operations, in each case without regard to the location of the travel or the customer purchasing the travel. 50 Gross bookings resulting from airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold through our domestic and international operations in 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change Domestic $ 2.154 billion $ 1.973 billion 9.2 % International $ 2.675 billion $ 1.347 billion 98.6 % Total $ 4.829 billion $ 3.320 billion 45.5 % Gross bookings resulting from airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold through our agency and merchant models in 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change Agency $ 3.585 billion $ 2.182 billion 64.4 % Merchant $ 1.244 billion $ 1.138 billion 9.3 % Total $ 4.829 billion $ 3.320 billion 45.5 % Gross bookings increased by 45.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to 98.6% growth in our international gross bookings, virtually all of which relates to retail hotel room night sales (including the $223 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates). Domestic gross bookings increased by 9.2%, primarily due to growth in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, retail airline tickets due to the elimination of booking fees in June of 2007 and Name Your Own Price® rental car days, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Agency gross bookings increased 64.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007, due to growth in our international hotel operations and in the sale of retail airline tickets due to the elimination of booking fees in June of 2007. Merchant gross bookings increased 9.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007, due to an increase n the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights and an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® rental car days, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Year Ended Airline Tickets Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days December 31, 2007 2.9 million 27.8 million 8.6 million December 31, 2006 2.8 million 18.7 million 7.5 million Airline tickets sold increased by 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007, over the same period in 2006. The increase in the number of airline tickets sold in the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Retail airline ticket bookings increased primarily due to our elimination of booking fees in June 2007. 51 Hotel room nights sold increased by 48.9% for the year ended December 31, 2007, over the same period in 2006, primarily due to an increase in the sale of agency room nights in connection with our international operations as well as an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights in the United States. Rental car days sold increased by 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2007, over the same period in 2006, due to increases in sales of both our Name Your Own Price® and retail rental car services. Revenues We classify our revenue into three categories: · Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our customers, selecting suppliers and remitting payments to our suppliers. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotels; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions. · Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. In June 2007, we eliminated processing fees on the priceline.com price-disclosed airline ticket service. · Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our travel business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of domestic point-of-sale travel services to a business that includes significant sales of international point-of-sale hotel services, a significant majority of which are currently generated in Europe. Because our domestic services include merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services, which are reported on a “gross” basis, while both our domestic and international retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations contributed approximately $372.6 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, which compares to $182.7 million for the same period in 2006. Approximately $30.3 million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 52 Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Merchant Revenues $ 1,002,824 $ 904,169 10.9 % Agency Revenues 398,246 213,900 86.2 % Other Revenues 8,339 5,034 65.7 % Total Revenues $ 1,409,409 $ 1,123,103 25.5 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 10.9% compared to the same period in 2006, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® and merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights and Name Your Own Price® rental car days, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. In addition, as more fully discussed in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded excise tax refunds of $18.6 million in merchant revenues in the year ended December 31, 2007. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 86.2% compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of growth in our international operations, which contributed $367 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, and $179 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $30.0 million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by declines in agency revenue related to the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets, for which priceline.com ceased charging processing fees in June 2007. Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 65.7%, compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues due to new advertising partner relationships in 2007. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Cost of Merchant Revenues $ 769,997 $ 722,004 6.6 % % of Merchant Revenues 76.8 % 79.9 % Cost of Agency Revenues — — — % of Agency Revenues 0.0 % 0.0 % Cost of Other Revenues — — — % of Other Revenues 0.0 % 0.0 % Total Cost of Revenues $ 769,997 $ 722,004 6.6 % % of Revenues 54.6 % 64.3 % 53 Cost of Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2007, cost of revenues entirely reflect merchant Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue while retail transactions are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Cost of Merchant Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2007, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; and (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes. Cost of merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 6.6%, compared to the same period in 2006, due primarily to the increase in merchant revenue discussed above. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues are recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of Agency Revenues Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. Cost of Other Revenues For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no costs of other revenues. Gross Profit Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by 59.4% compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of increased revenue. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to retail, price-disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Gross profit and gross margin were also positively impacted by the $18.6 million excise tax refund recorded in merchant revenue in the year ended December 31, 2007 (see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. 54 Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Merchant Gross Profit $ 232,827 $ 182,165 27.8 % Merchant Gross Margin 23.2 % 20.1 % Agency Gross Profit 398,246 213,900 86.2 % Agency Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Other Gross Profit 8,339 5,034 65.7 % Other Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Total Gross Profit $ 639,412 $ 401,099 59.4 % Total Gross Margin 45.4 % 35.7 % Merchant Gross Profit Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2007, merchant gross profit increased from the same period in 2006, primarily due to an increase in merchant revenue. Merchant gross margin increased primarily because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared to merchant price-disclosed hotel transactions, which are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. In addition, merchant gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2007, was positively affected by the excise tax refund of $18.6 million included in merchant revenue (see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Agency Gross Profit Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which are recorded net of agency costs, if any. For the year ended December 31, 2007, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of growth in bookings for retail agency hotel room nights for our international operations. Other Gross Profit During the year ended December 31, 2007, other gross profit increased from the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues due to new advertising partner relationships in 2007. 55 Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Offline Advertising $ 35,963 $ 31,831 13.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 5.6 % 7.9 % Online Advertising 172,676 $ 113,822 51.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 27.0 % 28.4 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, radio and print advertising; and (2) agency fees, the cost for creative talent and production costs for television, radio and print advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2007, offline advertising expenses were higher than in the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of increased television and print advertising related to our “Negotiator” advertising campaign, partially offset by a decrease in radio advertising. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2007, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses to support significantly increased retail agency hotel room nights booked by our international operations, which rely primarily on online advertising, in particular keyword purchases and payments to affiliate advertisers, to drive their businesses, partially offset by the elimination of advertising fees paid under our agreement with Orbitz, which expired on December 31, 2006, and the impact of higher efficiency requirements (i.e., higher internal “return on investment” criteria) on other online spend. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Sales and Marketing $ 47,158 $ 42,119 12.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 7.4 % 10.5 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks. For the year ended December 31, 2007, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes. 56 Personnel Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Personnel $ 102,992 $ 79,421 29.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 16.1 % 19.8 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2007, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to increased personnel expenses associated with head count growth of our international operations and increased employee performance bonus expense. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $14.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change General and Administrative $ 91,837 $ 28,587 221.3 % % of Total Gross Profit 14.4 % 7.1 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) personnel related expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2007, over the same period during 2006, due to (1) a $55.4 million expense related to our net cost of a litigation settlement, including related legal fees (see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), (2) a $1.7 million one-time receipt of certain franchise tax credits in the third quarter 2006, (3) additional fees for outside professionals and expenses related to pending litigation, and (4) increased general and administrative expenses, particularly occupancy and personnel related expenses, associated with the growth of our international operations. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Information Technology $13,779 $9,749 41.3 % % of Total Gross Profit 2.2 % 2.4 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) outsourced data center costs relating to our domestic and international data centers; (2) system maintenance and software license fees; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2006, was primarily associated with the growth of our international operations. 57 Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Depreciation and Amortization $ 37,072 $ 33,449 10.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 5.8 % 8.3 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2007, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of increased depreciation and amortization related to investment in our international operations. Restructuring Charge, net Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Restructuring Charge, net $ — $ 135 (100.0 )% In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a net restructuring charge of approximately $135,000 related to vacated leased property. Interest Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Interest Income $ 25,776 $ 11,312 127.9 % Interest Expense (10,412 ) (7,060 ) 47.5 % Total $ 15,364 $ 4,252 261.3 % For the year ended December 31, 2007, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher prevailing interest rates and significantly higher cash balances throughout 2007, and including approximately $3.3 million of interest received on our excise tax refund. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the same period in 2006, due primarily to increased average debt balances in 2007, as well as an increase in prevailing interest rates on the variable portion of the interest rate swap agreement related to our 1% Convertible Senior Notes. 58 Taxes Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Income Tax Benefit $ 12,059 $ 12,388 (2.7 )% Income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 differs from the expected tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily because it includes benefits amounting to $47.9 and $28.1 million, respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Other items resulting in a difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate include a tax benefit of approximately $3.6 million resulting from the recognition of foreign capital allowance carryforwards in 2007, the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt and lower foreign tax rates, partly offset by state income taxes in 2007 and 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Netherlands enacted a reduction in its statutory tax rate from 29.6% to 25.5%, effective January 1, 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, the United Kingdom enacted a reduction in its statutory tax rate from 30% to 28%, effective April 1, 2008. We recognized benefits of $1.3 million and $3.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, resulting from the impact on deferred taxes of these enacted statutory tax rate reductions. Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay significant U.S. federal income taxes for the foreseeable future. We expect to make cash payments for U.S. alternative minimum tax and for certain international taxes. Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests $ (5,000 ) $ (3,554 ) 40.7 % Equity in income (loss) of investees and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, represented (1) minority interests associated with the ownership of priceline.com International that is held by former shareholders of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, including certain European-based managers of that business; and (2) equity in income (loss) of investees, principally comprised of our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results. The change in equity in income of investees and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the minority interest in the earnings of priceline.com International. Also, the prior year includes a $1.1 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment in pricelinemortgage.com to its estimated fair value. 59 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Operating Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers. The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold through our websites and the related gross bookings were as follows: Year Gross Airline Hotel Rental Ended Bookings Tickets Room Nights Car Days December 31, 2006 $ 3.3 billion 2.8 million 18.7 million 7.5 million December 31, 2005 $ 2.2 billion 2.8 million 11.8 million 5.8 million Gross bookings increased by 49.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005. The increase was driven primarily by an increase of 85.6% in “agency” bookings for the year ended December 31, 2006, which was primarily attributable to (1) growth in our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively; (2) an increase in the average fare of our retail ticket service, and (3) the increased sale of retail rental cars. Merchant gross bookings increased by 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in merchant gross bookings relating to our domestic retail hotel service, an increase in the average daily rate of our Name Your Own Price® hotel service and an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® rental car days. Airline tickets sold increased by 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in 2005. The increase in the number of airline tickets sold in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005, was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Hotel room nights sold increased by 58.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in 2005. The increase in the number of hotel room nights sold in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005, was primarily due to growth in our hotel room nights sold through (1) our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and (2) our domestic retail hotel service. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights. Our retail hotel service benefited from the enhanced integration of our retail and Name Your Own Price® services in the first quarter of 2006. We believe that the benefit to our retail hotel service came partially at the expense of sales of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights during the year ended December 31, 2006, as some amount of demand that may otherwise have been directed to the Name Your Own Price® service instead was directed to our retail hotel service. Rental car days sold increased by 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in 2005, due to increases in sales of both our retail and Name Your Own Price® rental car services, which benefited from the launch of enhanced integration of retail and Name Your Own Price® services in 60 the first quarter 2006, as well as from the launch of new features in 2005, including options for one-way destination and off-airport car rentals. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our airline ticket business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of merchant (“opaque”) Name Your Own Price® travel services to a business that includes the sale of retail, price-disclosed travel services. Because merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services are reported on a “gross” basis and retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Additionally, our European operations contributed approximately $182.7 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, which are primarily recorded on a “net” basis. Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Merchant Revenues $ 904,169 $ 859,404 5.2 % Agency Revenues 213,900 99,051 116.0 % Other Revenues 5,034 4,205 19.7 % Total Revenues $ 1,123,103 $ 962,660 16.7 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 5.2% compared to the same period in 2005, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® rental car days, Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, and vacation packages. A substantial portion of the increase was due to services sold through our agreement with Orbitz, which we entered into on January 1, 2006. Under our agreement with Orbitz, we paid fees in exchange for a link on the Orbitz website that directed traffic to the Name Your Own Price® service. The agreement expired on December 31, 2006. While the Orbitz agreement provided us with a good source of traffic, we believe it was likely dilutive in that many of the customers that we paid Orbitz for may have purchased our travel services anyway. While the expiration of the Orbitz agreement may result in decreased merchant volume in 2007 — we estimate potentially up to approximately 5% of our 2007 merchant volume after taking into account estimated dilution - it frees up marketing dollars that we may use in other online channels. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 116% compared to the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of (1) growth in our European operations, which contributed $179 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006, and $67 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005; and (2) increased sales of domestic retail hotel room nights and retail rental car days. Results from our European operations are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. 61 Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 19.7%, compared to the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenue related to the inclusion of results of operation from our online advertising company since it was acquired in June 2006. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Cost of Merchant Revenues $ 722,004 $ 694,190 4.0 % % of Merchant Revenues 79.9 % 80.8 % Cost of Agency Revenues — 607 (100.0 )% % of Agency Revenues 0.0 % 0.6 % Cost of Other Revenues — — — % of Other Revenues — — Total Cost of Revenues $ 722,004 $ 694,797 3.9 % % of Revenues 64.3 % 72.2 % Cost of Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2006, cost of revenues increased 3.9%, compared to the same period in 2005, due primarily to the fact that merchant revenues increased comparably in the same period. Cost of revenues entirely reflect merchant Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue while retail transactions are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Cost of Merchant Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2006, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; and (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes. Cost of merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 4.0%, compared to the same period in 2005, due primarily to the fact that merchant revenues increased comparably in the same period. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues are recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. 62 Cost of Agency Revenues Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquisition activity. Cost of Other Revenues For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no costs of other revenues. Gross Profit Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by 49.7% compared to the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1) our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively; and (2) increased sales of retail hotel room nights. The contribution to gross profit from airline ticket sales during the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by a decrease in net GDS fees per ticket as compared to the same period in 2005, which contributed to lower margins on retail ticket sales in particular. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005, because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to retail, price-disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Merchant Gross Profit $ 182,165 $ 165,214 10.3 % Merchant Gross Margin 20.1 % 19.2 % Agency Gross Profit 213,900 98,444 117.3 % Agency Gross Margin 100.0 % 99.4 % Other Gross Profit 5,034 4,205 19.7 % Other Gross Margin 100.0 % 100.0 % Total Gross Profit $ 401,099 $ 267,863 49.7 % Total Gross Margin 35.7 % 27.8 % Merchant Gross Profit Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, merchant gross profit increased from the same period in 2005, primarily due to an increase in the sale of domestic merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights and Name Your Own Price® rental car days. The contribution to merchant gross profit from Name Your Own Price® airline ticket sales during the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by a decrease in net GDS fees per ticket as compared to the same period in 2005. A substantial portion of the increase in merchant gross profit was due to services sold through our agreement with Orbitz, as discussed above. Our agreement with Orbitz expired on December 31, 2006. Merchant gross margin increased primarily because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding 63 cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in the year ended December 31, 2006, when compared to merchant price-disclosed hotel transactions, which are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Agency Gross Profit Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which are recorded net of agency costs, if any. For the year ended December 31, 2006, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of (1) growth in our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively; and (2) increased sales of retail hotel room nights and rental car days. Other Gross Profit During the year ended December 31, 2006, other gross profit increased from the same period in 2005 primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues related to including results of operations from our online advertising company since it was acquired in June 2006. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Offline Advertising $31,831 $30,957 2.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 7.9 % 11.6 % Online Advertising $113,822 $58,535 94.5 % % of Total Gross Profit 28.4 % 21.9 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, radio and print advertising; and (2) agency fees, the cost for creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials. For the year ended December 31, 2006, offline advertising expenses were slightly higher than in the same period in 2005. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail advertisements. For the year ended December 31, 2006, online advertising expenses increased significantly over the same period in 2005, primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses related to (1) supporting the growth of our European operations, which rely primarily on online advertising to drive their businesses and (2) an increase in our domestic online advertising, including fees paid pursuant to our agreement with Orbitz. 64 Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Sales and Marketing $ 42,119 $ 34,295 22.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 10.5 % 12.8 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks. For the year ended December 31, 2006, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2005, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes. Personnel Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Personnel $ 79,421 $ 49,659 59.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 19.8 % 18.5 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2006, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2005, primarily due to increased personnel expenses associated with head count growth of our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, increased employee performance bonus expense and an increase in stock-based compensation due mainly to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, which requires companies to record non-cash compensation expense related to stock-based awards granted to employees. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $14.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006, and approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 General and Administrative $ 28,587 $ 20,881 36.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 7.1 % 7.8 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) business insurance. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period during 2005, due to increased general and administrative expenses associated with the growth of our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which 65 were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and additional fees for outside professionals and expenses related to pending litigation. This increase was partially offset by the one-time receipt of certain franchise tax credits from the state of Connecticut in the amount of approximately $1.7 million. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Information Technology $ 9,749 $ 10,622 (8.2 )% % of Total Gross Profit 2.4 % 4.0 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the year ended December 31, 2006, information technology expenses decreased domestically from the same period in 2005, in part due to efficiencies resulting from the integration of Travelweb’s operations. This decrease was partially offset by increased information technology expenses associated with our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Depreciation and Amortization $ 33,449 $ 25,366 31.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 8.3 % 9.5 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2006, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of increased non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with our European operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. 66 Restructuring Charge, net Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Restructuring Charge, net $ 135 $ 1,664 (91.9 )% In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $135,000 related to vacated leased property. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a net restructuring charge of approximately $1.7 million, consisting of a $2 million restructuring charge related to vacated leased property and a $336,000 restructuring reversal related to estimated costs to complete certain restructuring activities in Europe. Interest Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Interest Income $ 11,312 $ 5,550 103.8 % Interest Expense (7,060 ) (5,075 ) 39.1 % Total $ 4,252 $ 475 795.2 % For the year ended December 31, 2006, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2005, primarily due to higher prevailing interest rates and significantly higher cash balances in the fourth quarter of 2006. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the same period in 2005, due primarily to an increase in debt balances in 2006, as well as an increase in prevailing interest rates on the variable portion of the interest rate swap agreement related to our 1% Convertible Senior Notes. Taxes Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Income Tax Benefit $ 12,388 $ 156,277 (92.1 )% Income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 differs from the expected tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% because it includes benefits amounting to $28.1 million and $170.5 million, respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Other items resulting in a difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate include the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt, and lower foreign tax rates, partly offset by state income taxes. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Netherlands enacted a reduction in its statutory tax rate from 29.6% to 25.5%, effective January 1, 2007. We recognized a benefit of $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulting from the impact on deferred taxes of the Netherlands tax rate reduction. Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income tax for the foreseeable future. We expect to make cash payments for U.S. alternative minimum tax and for certain international taxes. 67 Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests Year Ended December 31, Change ($000) 2006 2005 Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and Minority Interests $ (3,554 ) $ 749 (574.5 )% Equity in income (loss) of investees and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, represented (1) minority interests associated with the ownership of priceline.com International that is held by certain managers of that business; and (2) equity in income (loss) of investees, principally comprised of our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results. The change in equity in income of investees and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the minority interest in the earnings of priceline.com International and a decrease in earnings of and an impairment charge recorded for our investment in pricelinemortgage.com. Due to recent losses incurred by pricelinemortgage.com, we reviewed the carrying value of our investment for impairment. Based upon recent operating results and future projected results, we determined that our investment was impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. Accordingly, in the third quarter, we recognized a charge of $1.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our equity investment in pricelinemortgage.com to its estimated fair value. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following discussion gives effect to the restatement as discussed in Note 21 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2007, we had $507.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We generally invest excess cash to make such funds readily available for operating purposes. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of highly liquid, high quality, investment grade debt instruments. All of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter. This can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would indicate. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $156.0 million, resulting from net income of $157.1 million, non-cash items not affecting 2007 cash flows of $18.9 million offset by $19.9 million of negative changes in working capital. Net income includes a charge of $55.4 million paid to settle litigation, $21.9 million received in excise tax refunds and related interest (see Note 17 to our Consolidated financial Statements for further information regarding the litigation settlement and excise tax refund) and a $1.2 million favorable litigation settlement related to credit card processing fees. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2007, were primarily related to a $33.4 million increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $9.8 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily due to significant revenue growth for our international operations. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased primarily due to a $5.3 million increase in bonus accruals and a $3.6 million increase in online advertising accruals. We do not believe there has been any significant change in credit risk regarding our accounts receivable. Non-cash items were primarily associated with deferred income tax benefit, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, primarily related to acquisition-related intangible assets. The deferred income tax benefit resulted primarily from the $47.9 million non-cash reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax valuation allowance, as well as a $3.6 million non-recurring income tax benefit resulting from the recognition of foreign capital allowance carry forwards in the fourth quarter 68 of 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $112.1 million, resulting from net income of $74.5 million, non-cash items not affecting 2006 cash flows of $32.7 million and $4.9 million of positive changes in working capital. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2006, were primarily related to a $27.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $21.2 million increase in accounts receivable. The increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable were primarily due to an increase in merchant bookings in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased primarily due to an $8.2 million increase in bonus accruals and a $5.0 million increase in on-line advertising accruals. Non-cash items were primarily associated with deferred income tax benefit, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions of Travelweb, Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V. The non-cash deferred income tax benefit resulted primarily from the $28.1 million reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax valuation allowance. Net cash used in investing activities was $221.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Investing activities were affected by $116.1 million of net purchases of investments for the year ended December 31, 2007, and the purchase of $76.1 million of stock in priceline.com International held by minority interest shareholders. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2007, we invested $14.6 million, net of cash acquired, in acquisitions, the substantial majority of which related to the Agoda Companies. Net cash provided by investing activities was $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 were affected by $64.9 million of net redemptions of short-term investments, partially offset by the purchase of $19.8 million of stock in priceline.com International held by minority interest shareholders. Additionally, restricted cash decreased by $19.9 million in 2006 as we are no longer required to collateralize outstanding letters of credit with restricted cash balances. Cash invested in purchases of property and equipment was $15.9 million and $12.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily related to $19.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $3.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by $2.6 million of treasury stock purchases and $1.3 million of debt issuance costs. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $177.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily related to the issuance of $345 million of senior convertible notes and $14.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by $135.8 million of treasury stock purchases, $9.1 million of debt issuance costs and $37.4 million for the purchase of conversion spread hedges. The following table represents the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007 (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands) Two to Less than Three Four to After Five Total One Year Years Five Years Years Operating lease obligations $ 24,432 $ 6,327 $ 11,926 $ 4,914 $ 1,265 Convertible debt(1) 575,062 575,062 — — — Minority interest(2) 95,000 95,000 — — — Total $ 694,494 $ 676,389 $ 11,926 $ 4,914 $ 1,265 (1) At December 31, 2007 the Company’s convertible debt is a current liability because the contingent conversion thresholds on each of the Notes were exceeded. As a result, the Notes are convertible at the option of the holder. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also includes interest payable on the Notes thru 2008. (2) Assumes holders of minority interests put their shares to us at the earliest possible date based upon the estimated fair value at December 31, 2007 (see Note 15 for terms of put provisions). 69 As more fully discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, after giving effect to the October 2007 repurchase of priceline.com International shares, the total minority interest in priceline.com International on a fully diluted basis is approximately 3.3% at December 31, 2007. The aggregate fair value of the minority interest in priceline.com International subject to future puts and calls is estimated to be approximately $95 million at December 31, 2007, including unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units. We expect the future fair value of the minority interest to grow based upon expected continued strong performance of the international business. Based upon the closing price of our common stock during the measurement periods provided for by our convertible debt during the three months ended December 31, 2007, the contingent conversion thresholds on each of our convertible senior note issues were exceeded. As a result, all of our outstanding notes (aggregate principal amount $570 million) are convertible at the option of the holder as of December 31, 2007 and, accordingly, have been classified as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. While many factors contribute to the likelihood that the holders of the notes will elect to convert all or a portion of the notes, as the price of our common stock increases, the likelihood of conversion also increases. If holders elect to convert, we would be required to settle the principal amount of the notes in cash and the conversion premium in cash or shares of common stock at our option. We would likely fund the repayment with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (totaling approximately $507.9 million at December 31, 2007), borrowings under our revolving credit facility, common stock issuances and/or additional borrowings. In September 2007, we entered into a $175 million five-year revolving credit facility with a group of lenders, which is secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our assets and related intangible assets located in the United States. In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the assets and related intangible assets of our material direct and indirect domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association’s prime lending rate and (b) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%; or at an adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.375%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $50 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, which are available in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The Company may request that an additional $100 million be added to the revolving credit facility or to enter into one or more tranches of additional term loans. The proceeds of loans made under the facility could be used for working capital or general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2007, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility and the Company has issued approximately $14.7 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our 70 business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue growth or sustained profitability will be realized or that future borrowings or equity sales will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2007, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest risk and forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk. The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2007. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2007, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future. As of December 31, 2007, the carrying value of our debt is approximately $570 million. We estimate that the fair market value of such debt was approximately $1.66 billion as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we held an interest rate swap agreement on $45 million notional value of our fixed rate debt. The fair value cost to terminate this swap as of December 31, 2007 was approximately $0.1 million. A 10% adverse fluctuation in the 3-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2007, would increase the cost to terminate the interest rate swap by approximately $0.1 million. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate sensitive derivative instrument would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying debt. As a result of the acquisitions of our European and Asian operations, we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other then the U.S. dollar (primarily Euros and British Pounds). As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will 71 result in increased net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. As of December 31, 2007, contracts with notional values of 16.0 million Euros and 3.7 million British Pounds were outstanding to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on consolidated operating results. As of December 31, 2006, contracts with notional values of 17.6 million Euros were outstanding. Foreign exchange gains (losses) from forward contracts in the amount of ($3.0 million), ($1.5 million) and $0.3 million were recorded in other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We may enter into additional forward contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by such changes.",2023-12-30 18:44:19.717748
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors.” Overview General. We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services, including hotel rooms, car rentals, airline tickets, vacation packages, cruises and destination services. In the United States, we offer our customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase travel services in a traditional, price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique Name Your Own Price® service, which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at discounted prices. Internationally, we offer our customers hotel room reservations in 75 countries and 27 languages. We launched our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to include, among others, the brands Booking.com and Active Hotels in Europe and Agoda in Asia. Our principal goal is to be the leading worldwide online hotel reservation service. At present, we derive substantially all of our revenues from the following sources: · Transaction revenues from our Name Your Own Price® hotel room, rental car and airline ticket services, as well as our vacation packages service; · Commissions earned from the sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and other travel services; · Customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both Name Your Own Price® and price-disclosed hotel rooms and Name Your Own Price® airline tickets and rental car services. We eliminated processing fees for our price-disclosed airline ticket service in June 2007; · Transaction revenue from our price-disclosed merchant hotel room service; · Global distribution system (“GDS”) reservation booking fees related to both our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car services, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and · Other revenues derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites. Over the last several years, our business has transitioned from one driven primarily by domestic results to one driven primarily by international results. Prior to 2004, substantially all of our revenues were generated within the United States. In September 2004, we acquired Booking.com Limited, a U.K.-based online hotel service; in July 2005, we acquired Booking.com B.V., a Netherlands-based online hotel service (together with Booking.com Limited, “Booking.com”); and in November 2007, we acquired priceline.com Mauritius Company Limited (formerly known as the Agoda Company, Ltd.), an online hotel service with operations in Singapore and Thailand (“Agoda”). During the year ended December 31, 2008, our international business — the significant majority of which is currently generated by our European operations — represented approximately 58.4% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers), and contributed more than two-thirds of our consolidated operating income. Given that our international business is primarily comprised of hotel reservation services, revenue earned 49 Table of Contents in connection with the reservation of hotel room nights has come to represent a substantial majority of our gross profit. Worldwide recession is negatively affecting the broad travel market and, as a result, our business. Most recently, global economic and financial market conditions have worsened markedly, creating uncertainty for consumers and pressuring consumer spending on travel. For example, hotel operators have recently reported significant decreases in occupancy rates (a common metric that measures hotel customer usage) and average daily rates (“ADRs”) in both the United States and Europe. We believe that the positive trends impacting our domestic and international business overshadowed these negative influences in 2008. However, market conditions have worsened significantly recently, with particular deterioration in the fourth quarter 2008, and continuing into 2009. We believe worldwide recession and these weakening travel market trends, including, without limitation, decreased consumer demand, further deterioration in ADRs and increases in cancellations, have had a negative impact on our business, particularly in Europe, and will continue to have a negative impact in the near term. We cannot predict the magnitude or duration of this worldwide recession, but our current limited visibility does not suggest any near-term improvement. The hotel industry has recently experienced a significant decrease in occupancy rates and we have experienced slowing demand growth, an increase in reservation cancellation rates and declining ADRs — trends which have continued to deteriorate and for which we do not anticipate any near-term improvement. While lower occupancy rates have historically resulted in hotel suppliers increasing their distribution of hotel rooms through third-party intermediaries such as us, our remuneration for hotel transactions changes proportionately with room price, and therefore, lower ADRs generally have a negative effect on our hotel business and a negative effect on our gross profit. We believe the current worldwide recession and lower ADRs are also responsible for the increase in the number of hotel cancellations, particularly at our international operations. Our international operations distribute hotel rooms primarily through an agency model where reservations are generally cancellable, as opposed to merchant models operated by us (principally in the U.S.) and our competition and through which reservations are generally not cancellable without penalty. As ADRs decline, customers who have existing reservations may cancel those reservations and rebook at a lower rate, and in times of economic stress, travelers are more likely to cancel their vacation plans outright. While decreasing ADRs and a worldwide recession make it relatively more attractive for consumers to make a cancellable agency reservation than a pre-paid reservation, our agency business will likely have higher cancellation rates compared to companies who offer predominantly merchant model hotel rooms. International Trends. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have trailed those of the United States. However, international consumers are rapidly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. In addition, the base of hotel suppliers in Europe is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. We believe these trends have enabled us to become the top online hotel service provider in Europe, and will allow us to successfully expand our service offerings internationally beyond Europe. As our international operations have become significant contributors to our results and international hotel bookings have become of increased importance to our earnings, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in certain of our operating expenses and other financial metrics. For example, because our international operations utilize online affiliate and search marketing as the principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our online advertising expense has increased significantly since our acquisition of those companies, a trend we expect to continue in 2009 and beyond. In addition, 50 Table of Contents and as discussed in more detail below, since the acquisitions of Booking.com, we have seen the effects of seasonal fluctuations on our operating results change as a result of different revenue recognition policies that apply to our price-disclosed services (including our international hotel service) as compared to our Name Your Own Price® services. Another impact of the growing importance that our international operations represent to our business is our increased exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Because we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States and are reporting our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency (principally the Euro and the British Pound Sterling) into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. Our international operations contributed approximately $619.8 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, which compares to $372.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $11.3 million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As a result, our year-over-year revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2008, was approximately 63.3% on a local currency basis compared to approximately 66.4% after giving effect to currency fluctuations. The U.S. dollar has generally weakened since we acquired Booking.com B.V. in July 2005, and as a result, the year over year growth rates in our international results, when reported in U.S. dollars, have been positively impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. However, the U.S. dollar has recently strengthened significantly against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, which results in decreased net assets, revenues, operating expenses, and net income, and in October 2008, for the first time since our acquisition of Booking.com B.V., the foreign exchange impact was negative rather than positive. Accordingly, it will become increasingly difficult for us to grow our gross bookings, revenues and earnings on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis during 2009 and beyond if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income. The impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was minimized by certain derivatives we held. As of December 31, 2008, derivatives with a notional value of 25.0 million Euros were outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, derivatives with notional values of 16.0 million Euros and 3.7 million British Pounds Sterling were outstanding. Furthermore, our derivative instruments are not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross bookings. Domestic Trends. While demand for online travel services continues to experience annualized growth, we believe that the domestic market share of third-party distributors, like priceline.com, has declined over the recent past and that the growth of the domestic online market for travel services has slowed. We believe the decline in market share is attributable, in part, to a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing. In addition, recent decreases in domestic airline capacity and the emerging prospect of industry consolidation, as evidenced by the recent merger agreement between Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, could further reduce the amount of airline tickets available to us. Furthermore, we have recently observed a sharp decline in passenger traffic and airfares across the airline industry, and we believe the airlines are experiencing significant year-over-year declines in yield, all of which we believe is principally due to the worldwide recession. Decreases in capacity and lower traveler demand negatively impact our domestic air business, which in turn has negative repercussions on our domestic hotel and rental car businesses. In addition, the current worldwide recession is partially responsible for a change in the arrangements between rental car companies and automobile manufacturers. Where manufacturers have historically supplied cars to rental car companies under a lease or another arrangement whereby the manufacturer would buy the car back when it is taken out of the fleet, manufacturers have begun to require the rental car companies to purchase the cars for their fleets, which shifts the burden of risk of selling the car to the rental car company. Because of the worldwide recession, rental car companies have struggled to sell such cars, and as a result, they are faced with excess supply. This, along with an intensely competitive environment, leads to lower retail rental car rates, which in turn, are beneficial to 51 Table of Contents our retail rental car business, but detrimental to our Name Your Own Price® business. Notwithstanding these trends, we continue to believe that the market for domestic online travel services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for growth. We also rely on fees paid to us by global distribution systems, or GDSs, for travel bookings made through GDSs for a portion of our gross profit and operating income. Connectivity to a GDS does not guarantee us access to the content of a travel supplier such as an airline or hotel company. We have agreements with a number of suppliers to obtain access to content, and are in continuing discussions with others to obtain similar access. If we were denied access to a suppliers’ full content or had to incur service fees in order to access or book such content, our results could suffer. We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our hotel business, to continue to promote the priceline.com brand in the United States, the Booking.com brand internationally, the Agoda brand in Asia and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into other international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, terrorist attacks, political instability, regional hostilities, increases in fuel prices, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel related accidents, travel related health concerns, unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes; or the withdrawal from our system of a major hotel supplier or airline, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above. For example, recent civil unrest during the peak booking season in Thailand, a key market for our Agoda business, negatively impacted booking volumes and future civil or political unrest would further disrupt Agoda’s business. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability. Seasonality. Our Name Your Own Price® services are generally non-refundable in nature, and accordingly, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking is generated. However, we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel services, including our international operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel. As a result, a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized as revenue until future quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which bookings are generated. Therefore, as our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different 52 Table of Contents assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management, including the following: · Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance. As required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Based upon management’s assessment of positive and negative evidence, we recorded non-cash tax benefits in 2007 and 2006 of $47.9 million and $28.1 million, respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Despite robust growth in the Company’s domestic earnings during 2008, the valuation allowance has not been reduced due to inherent uncertainty and the likely negative potential impact the worldwide recession will have on our future operating results and future realization of our deferred tax assets. · Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense over the service period based upon the grant date fair value of equity-based grants. We estimate forfeiture rates in determining the amount of compensation to record. In addition, we record stock-based compensation expense for grants that include a performance contingency based upon the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period. We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted, or when the probable outcome for performance-based shares is updated based upon changes in facts and circumstances. · Accounting for State and Local “Hotel Occupancy” Taxes. As discussed in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, several jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against many on-line travel companies, including us, alleging among other things, that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by a customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room. In addition, a number of jurisdictions have initiated audit proceedings against us purportedly to determine whether taxes are owed on this differential or issued assessments claiming that we owe tax on this differential for prior periods. Additional state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively, or both. Historically, we have not collected taxes on this differential. To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have additional tax exposures. We accrue for legal contingencies where it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. · Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Because we act as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs. In addition, in connection with hotel agency transactions, we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience, current trends and the age of commissions receivable. 53 Table of Contents · Valuation of Goodwill. We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired including Booking.com B.V., Booking.com Limited, Travelweb, Agoda and priceline.com europe Ltd. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded. · Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. · Airline Debit Memos. Our airline suppliers periodically send us debit memos that make claims for additional amounts due to them related to the cost of airline tickets we sold on their behalf. We process the debit memos received and, when appropriate, make payments to the airlines. Based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with the airlines, we establish reserves for estimated losses when appropriate resulting from these claims. Recent Accounting Pronouncements — On January 1, 2008, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP FAS 157-2”). FSP FAS 157-2 defers the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2008. We do not expect a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements for adoption of this Statement for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - an Amendment of FASB Statement 133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 provides new disclosure requirements for an entity’s derivative and hedging activities. SFAS 161 is effective for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We will comply with the expanded reporting requirements beginning in the first quarter of 2009. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (“FSP FAS 142-3”). In determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets, FSP FAS 142-3 removes the requirement to consider whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost of material modifications to the existing terms and conditions and, instead, requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements. FSP FAS 142-3 also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives. The FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and may impact any intangible assets we acquire in future transactions. 54 Table of Contents In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (“FSP APB 14-1”). FSP APB 14-1 requires cash settled convertible debt, such as our convertible senior notes, to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each. The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature. The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, representing the value assigned to the equity component, is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond. In addition, if our convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity and the fair value of the debt component immediately prior to extinguishment is different from the carrying value, it will result in a gain or loss on extinguishment. Although FSP APB 14-1 will have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows, it will require us to record a significant amount of non-cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized and will result in gains or losses on extinguishment that would not have occurred under previous GAAP. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and must be applied on a retrospective basis. Accordingly, commencing with the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2009, our historical financial statements will be adjusted to give effect to FSP APB 14-1. We estimate that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will increase non-cash interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 by approximately $26 million ($16 million net of tax), $28 million ($17 million net of tax), and $6 million ($3.6 million net of tax), respectively. The estimated impact to fiscal year 2009 non-cash interest expense is expected to be an increase of approximately $21 million ($13 million net of tax), excluding the impact of future debt conversions, if any. The Company estimates that adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will also result in a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $5 million ($3 million net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2008. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (“SFAS 162”). This Statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 162 is effective November 15, 2008. The adoption of the Statement did not result in a change in our current practices. In June 2008, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 07-5, “Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock” (“EITF 07-5”). This Issue addresses the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock. EITF 07-5 will be effective for years beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not expect a material impact to the financial statements for adoption of this EITF. In November 2008, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 08-7, “Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets” (“EITF 08-7”). A defensive asset is an acquired intangible asset where the acquirer has no intention of using, or intends to discontinue use of, the intangible asset but holds it to prevent competitors from obtaining any benefit from it. The acquired defensive asset will be treated as a separate unit of accounting and the useful life assigned will be based on the period during which the asset would diminish in value. The consensus is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). The standard required unrealized gains and losses to be included in earnings for items reported using the fair value option. SFAS 159 permitted companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We did not elect the fair value option described in SFAS 159 for financial instruments and certain other items. 55 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) requires an entity to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration will be reflected in earnings until the contingency is settled. SFAS 141(R) also requires acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs to be expensed as incurred rather than treated as part of the purchase price. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be characterized as non-controlling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS 160 is effective for us on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, except for presentation and disclosure requirements that will be applied retrospectively. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, reservations of hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services booked by our customers, and is widely used in the travel business. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings for our international brands and operations, and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings by our domestic operations, in each case without regard to the location of the travel or the customer purchasing the travel. Gross bookings resulting from hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our domestic and international operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change Domestic $ 3.082 billion $ 2.154 billion 43.0 % International 4.318 billion 2.675 billion 61.4 % Total $ 7.400 billion $ 4.829 billion 53.2 % 56 Table of Contents Gross bookings resulting from hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change Agency $ 5.739 billion $ 3.585 billion 60.1 % Merchant 1.662 billion 1.244 billion 33.5 % Total $ 7.400 billion $ 4.829 billion 53.2 % Gross bookings increased by 53.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to 61.4% growth in our international gross bookings, virtually all of which relates to retail hotel room night sales (including the $316 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates). Domestic gross bookings increased by 43.0%, primarily due to growth in the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets (due in part to the elimination of booking fees in June of 2007), Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights and Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Agency gross bookings increased 60.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due to growth in Booking.com hotel operations and in the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets due in part to the elimination of booking fees in June of 2007. Merchant gross bookings increased 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, the inclusion of room nights sold by Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007, domestic merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights and Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Agoda gross bookings amounted to $118.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Year Ended Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days Airline Tickets December 31, 2008 40.8 million 10.0 million 4.9 million December 31, 2007 27.8 million 8.6 million 2.9 million Hotel room nights sold increased by 46.9% for the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period in 2007, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Booking.com agency room nights, an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® room nights, the inclusion of merchant room nights sold by Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007, and an increase in the sale of domestic, price-disclosed room nights. Rental car days sold increased by 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period in 2007, due to increases in sales of both our price-disclosed and Name Your Own Price® rental car services. Airline tickets sold increased by 65.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period in 2007, due primarily to an increase in the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets due in part to our elimination of processing fees in June 2007 and increased marketing support. 57 Table of Contents Revenues · Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and, among other things, select suppliers and determine the price we will accept from the customer. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® hotel rooms, rental cars and airline tickets and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotels; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. · Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. In June 2007, we eliminated processing fees on the priceline.com price-disclosed airline ticket service. · Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our travel business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of domestic point-of-sale travel services to a business that includes significant sales of international point-of-sale hotel services, a significant majority of which are currently generated in Europe. Because our domestic services include merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services, which are reported on a “gross” basis, while both our domestic and international retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations contributed approximately $619.8 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, which compares to $372.6 million for the same period in 2007. Approximately $11.3 million of this increase is due to favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007, accounted for approximately $17.0 million of the revenue attributable to our international operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Merchant Revenues $ 1,218,162 $ 1,002,824 21.5 % Agency Revenues 648,792 398,246 62.9 % Other Revenues 17,852 8,339 114.1 % Total Revenues $ 1,884,806 $ 1,409,409 33.7 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 21.5% compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights and airline tickets and the inclusion of revenues generated by Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2007, merchant revenues were positively impacted by an excise tax refund of $18.6 million (see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Our 58 Table of Contents international operations contributed approximately $21.3 million to our merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, which compares to $5.6 million for the same period in 2007. Agoda contributed approximately $17.0 million of the merchant revenue attributable to our international operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 62.9% compared to the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of growth in our international operations, which contributed approximately $598 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008, and approximately $367 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $11.7 million of this increase is due to favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted primarily of advertising revenues. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 114.1%, compared to the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues due primarily to new advertising partner relationships added during 2007, increased traffic due in part to the elimination of booking fees on price-disclosed airline tickets in June 2007, and the inclusion of revenue generated by an online advertising company acquired in December 2007. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Cost of Revenues $ 928,835 $ 769,997 20.6 % % of Revenues 49.3 % 54.6 % Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of Name Your Own Price® hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; and (3) the cost of Name Your Own Price® rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 20.6%, compared to the same period in 2007, due primarily to the increase in merchant revenue discussed above. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues in the U.S. and at Agoda are recorded in merchant revenues net of the amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there is no associated cost of revenues for merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. 59 Table of Contents Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Gross Profit $ 955,971 $ 639,412 49.5 % Gross Margin 50.7 % 45.4 % Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 49.5% compared to the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to retail, price-disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2007, gross profit and gross margin were also positively impacted by the $18.6 million excise tax refund recorded in merchant revenue in the year ended December 31, 2007 (see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $616 million of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2008, which compares to $369.0 million for the same period in 2007. Approximately $11.6 million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007, accounted for approximately $17.0 million of the gross profit attributable to our international operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Offline Advertising $ 38,032 $ 35,963 5.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 4.0 % 5.6 % Online Advertising 270,713 172,676 56.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 28.3 % 27.0 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, print and radio advertising; and (2) the cost for creative talent, production costs and agency fees for television, radio and print advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2008, offline advertising expenses were higher than in the same period in 2007 primarily as a result of increased costs related to creative talent, television production and increased print and radio advertising, partially offset by decreased television advertising during the period. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2008, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2007, primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses to support significantly increased price-disclosed agency hotel room nights booked by 60 Table of Contents Booking.com as well as increased U.S. travel bookings. The increase also reflects the inclusion of online advertising expenses related to price-disclosed merchant hotel room nights booked through Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007. Both Booking.com and Agoda rely primarily on online advertising, in particular keyword purchases and payments to affiliate advertisers, to support their businesses. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Sales and Marketing $ 77,948 $ 47,158 65.3 % % of Total Gross Profit 8.2 % 7.4 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate the call centers for our priceline.com business; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2008, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2007, primarily due to (1) increased gross booking volumes; (2) increased bad debt provision due to slower payment of agency commissions by hotels and to reflect the potential for increased losses resulting from the worldwide recession and the related impact on the financial health of our hotel partners; (3) increased credit card chargeback activity (including chargeback activity aggregating approximately $1.5 million in the first six months of 2008 associated with the bankruptcies of two of our airline suppliers); and (4) the inclusion of sales and marketing expenses related to Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007 and which has experienced higher customer chargeback activity than our other merchant services. Personnel Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Personnel $ 163,785 $ 102,992 59.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 17.1 % 16.1 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2008, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2007, primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense, personnel expenses associated with head count growth of Booking.com, the acquisition of Agoda in November 2007, and increased employee performance bonus expense. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $16.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Stock-based compensation expense increased over the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the same period in 2007, due to headcount increases, higher stock prices at grant date and increases in the estimated probable number of shares to be issued upon completion of specified performance periods for our performance-based grants (see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). 61 Table of Contents General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change General and Administrative $ 55,267 $ 91,837 (39.8 )% % of Total Gross Profit 5.8 % 14.4 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period in 2007, due to a $55.4 million expense related to a litigation settlement in 2007. Excluding the litigation settlement, general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period during 2007, due to additional fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses and expenses related to the evaluation of acquisition opportunities, increased occupancy expenses associated with new Booking.com offices, and the inclusion of general and administrative expenses related to Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Information Technology $ 17,956 $ 13,779 30.3 % % of Total Gross Profit 1.9 % 2.2 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) outsourced data center costs relating to our domestic and international data centers; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2007 was primarily associated with the growth of Booking.com, and the inclusion of Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Depreciation and Amortization $ 42,796 $ 37,072 15.4 % % of Total Gross Profit 4.5 % 5.8 % 62 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of increased amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives, depreciation and amortization related to investment increases in Booking.com, and the inclusion of depreciation and amortization related to Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007. Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Interest Income $ 11,660 $ 25,776 (54.8 )% Interest Expense (9,375 ) (10,412 ) (10.0 )% Foreign Currency Transactions and Other 3,810 (3,276 ) (216.3 )% Total $ 6,095 $ 12,088 (49.6 )% For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest income on cash and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2007, due to lower prevailing interest rates and investments in higher quality, lower yielding securities. In addition, interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 included approximately $3.3 million of interest received on our excise tax refund. Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the same period in 2007 due primarily to the conversion of approximately $176.9 million principal amount of convertible notes. We estimate that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will increase non-cash interest expense for 2009 by $21 million (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Foreign exchange gains of $4.3 million and losses of $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were recorded in “Foreign currency transactions and other,” and were principally related to foreign exchange derivative contracts. In addition, “Foreign currency transactions and other” includes a loss in the amount of $0.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008 to reflect an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of a corporate note included in long-term investments. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Income Tax (Expense) Benefit $ (98,408 ) $ 12,059 (916.1 )% The provision for income taxes includes U.S. and international income taxes determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate. Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes non-cash tax benefits of (1) $47.9 million, resulting from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets and (2) $3.6 million resulting from the recognition of foreign capital allowance carryforwards. In addition, our effective tax rate differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% principally due to lower foreign tax rates and the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible stock-based compensation expense. Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income for the foreseeable future. We expect to make cash payments for international income taxes, U.S. alternative minimum tax and certain U.S. state income taxes. Despite robust growth in the Company’s domestic 63 Table of Contents earnings during 2008, the valuation allowance has not been reduced due to inherent uncertainty and the likely negative potential impact the current worldwide recession will have on our future operating results and future realization of our deferred tax assets. Equity in Loss of Investees and Minority Interests Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Equity in Loss of Investees and Minority Interests $ 3,688 $ 5,000 (26.2 )% Equity in loss of investee and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, represented (1) minority interests associated with the ownership of priceline.com International that was held by former shareholders of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, including certain European-based managers of that business; and (2) equity in loss of investee, comprised of our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results. The change versus the prior year was primarily due to a reduction in the minority interest held by former shareholders of priceline.com International, partially offset by an increase in the earnings of priceline.com International. In September 2008, we repurchased all of the remaining outstanding shares of priceline.com International and, as a result, there is no longer any minority interest in priceline.com International. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Operating Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings for our international brands and operations, and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings by our domestic operations, in each case without regard to the location of the travel or the customer purchasing the travel. Gross bookings resulting from airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold through our domestic and international operations in 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change Domestic $ 2.154 billion $ 1.973 billion 9.2 % International 2.675 billion 1.347 billion 98.6 % Total $ 4.829 billion $ 3.320 billion 45.5 % 64 Table of Contents Gross bookings resulting from airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days sold through our agency and merchant models in 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change Agency $ 3.585 billion $ 2.182 billion 64.4 % Merchant 1.244 billion 1.138 billion 9.3 % Total $ 4.829 billion $ 3.320 billion 45.5 % Gross bookings increased by 45.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to 98.6% growth in our international gross bookings, virtually all of which relates to retail hotel room night sales (including the $223 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates). Domestic gross bookings increased by 9.2%, primarily due to growth in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, retail airline tickets due to the elimination of booking fees in June of 2007 and Name Your Own Price® rental car days, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Agency gross bookings increased 64.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007, due to growth in our international hotel operations and in the sale of retail airline tickets due to the elimination of booking fees in June 2007. Merchant gross bookings increased 9.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007, due to an increase n the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights and an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® rental car days, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Year Ended Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days Airline Tickets December 31, 2007 27.8 million 8.6 million 2.9 million December 31, 2006 18.7 million 7.5 million 2.8 million Hotel room nights sold increased by 48.9% for the year ended December 31, 2007, over the same period in 2006, primarily due to an increase in the sale of agency room nights in connection with our international operations as well as an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights in the United States. Rental car days sold increased by 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2007, over the same period in 2006, due to increases in sales of both our Name Your Own Price® and retail rental car services. Airline tickets sold increased by 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007, over the same period in 2006. The increase in the number of airline tickets sold in the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Retail airline ticket bookings increased primarily due to our elimination of booking fees in June 2007. Revenues · Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and, among other things, select suppliers and determine the price we will accept from the customer. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and price-disclosed 65 Table of Contents vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotels; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. · Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. In June 2007, we eliminated processing fees on the priceline.com price-disclosed airline ticket service. · Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our travel business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of domestic point-of-sale travel services to a business that includes significant sales of international point-of-sale hotel services, a significant majority of which are currently generated in Europe. Because our domestic services include merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services, which are reported on a “gross” basis, while both our domestic and international retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations contributed approximately $372.6 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, which compares to $182.7 million for the same period in 2006. Approximately $30.3 million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Merchant Revenues $ 1,002,824 $ 904,169 10.9 % Agency Revenues 398,246 213,900 86.2 % Other Revenues 8,339 5,034 65.7 % Total Revenues $ 1,409,409 $ 1,123,103 25.5 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 10.9% compared to the same period in 2006, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® and merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights and Name Your Own Price® rental car days, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. In addition, as more fully discussed in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded excise tax refunds of $18.6 million in merchant revenues in the year ended December 31, 2007. 66 Table of Contents Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 86.2% compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of growth in our international operations, which contributed $367 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, and $179 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $30.0 million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by declines in agency revenue related to the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets, for which priceline.com ceased charging processing fees in June 2007. Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 65.7%, compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues due to new advertising partner relationships in 2007. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Cost of Revenues $ 769,997 $ 722,004 6.6 % % of Revenues 54.6 % 64.3 % Cost of Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2007, cost of revenues entirely reflect merchant Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue while retail transactions are recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2007, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; and (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 6.6%, compared to the same period in 2006, due primarily to the increase in merchant revenue discussed above. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues are recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. 67 Table of Contents Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Gross Profit $ 639,412 $ 401,099 59.4 % Gross Margin 45.4 % 35.7 % Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by 59.4% compared to the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of increased revenue. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to retail, price-disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Gross profit and gross margin were also positively impacted by the $18.6 million excise tax refund recorded in merchant revenue in the year ended December 31, 2007 (see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Offline Advertising $ 35,963 $ 31,831 13.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 5.6 % 7.9 % Online Advertising $ 172,676 $ 113,822 51.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 27.0 % 28.4 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, radio and print advertising; and (2) agency fees, the cost for creative talent and production costs for television, radio and print advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2007, offline advertising expenses were higher than in the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of increased television and print advertising related to our “Negotiator” advertising campaign, partially offset by a decrease in radio advertising. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2007, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses to support significantly increased retail agency hotel room nights booked by our international operations, which rely primarily on online advertising, in particular keyword purchases and payments to affiliate advertisers, to drive their businesses, partially offset by the elimination of advertising fees paid under our agreement with Orbitz, 68 Table of Contents which expired on December 31, 2006, and the impact of higher efficiency requirements (i.e., higher internal “return on investment” criteria) on other online spend. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Sales and Marketing $ 47,158 $ 42,119 12.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 7.4 % 10.5 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate our call centers for our priceline.com business; and (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks. For the year ended December 31, 2007, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes. Personnel Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Personnel $ 102,992 $ 79,421 29.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 16.1 % 19.8 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2007, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to increased personnel expenses associated with head count growth of our international operations and increased employee performance bonus expense. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $14.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change General and Administrative $ 91,837 $ 28,587 221.3 % % of Total Gross Profit 14.4 % 7.1 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) personnel related expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2007, over the same period during 2006, due to (1) a $55.4 million expense related to our net cost of a litigation settlement, including related legal fees (see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), (2) a $1.7 million one-time receipt of certain franchise tax credits in the third quarter 2006, (3) additional fees for outside professionals and 69 Table of Contents expenses related to pending litigation, and (4) increased general and administrative expenses, particularly occupancy and personnel related expenses, associated with the growth of our international operations. Information Technology Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Information Technology $ 13,779 $ 9,749 41.3 % % of Total Gross Profit 2.2 % 2.4 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) outsourced data center costs relating to our domestic and international data centers; (2) system maintenance and software license fees; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2006, was primarily associated with the growth of our international operations. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Depreciation and Amortization $ 37,072 $ 33,449 10.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 5.8 % 8.3 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2007, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2006, primarily as a result of increased depreciation and amortization related to investment in our international operations. Restructuring Charge, net Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Restructuring Charge, net $ — $ 135 (100.0 )% In the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a net restructuring charge of approximately $135,000 related to vacated leased property. 70 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Interest Income $ 25,776 $ 11,312 127.9 % Interest Expense (10,412 ) (7,060 ) 47.5 % Foreign Currency Transactions and Other (3,276 ) (606 ) (540.6 )% Total $ 12,088 $ 3,646 231.5 % For the year ended December 31, 2007, interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher prevailing interest rates and significantly higher cash balances throughout 2007, and including approximately $3.3 million of interest received on our excise tax refund. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the same period in 2006, due primarily to increased average debt balances in 2007, as well as an increase in prevailing interest rates on the variable portion of the interest rate swap agreement related to our 1% Convertible Senior Notes. Foreign exchange losses of $3.3 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were recorded in “Foreign currency transactions and other.” Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Income Tax Benefit $ 12,059 $ 12,388 (2.7 )% Income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 differs from the expected tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily because it includes benefits amounting to $47.9 and $28.1 million, respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Other items resulting in a difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate include a tax benefit of approximately $3.6 million resulting from the recognition of foreign capital allowance carryforwards in 2007, the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt and lower foreign tax rates, partly offset by state income taxes in 2007 and 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Netherlands enacted a reduction in its statutory tax rate from 29.6% to 25.5%, effective January 1, 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, the United Kingdom enacted a reduction in its statutory tax rate from 30% to 28%, effective April 1, 2008. We recognized benefits of $1.3 million and $3.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, resulting from the impact on deferred taxes of these enacted statutory tax rate reductions. Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay significant U.S. federal income taxes for the foreseeable future. We expect to make cash payments for U.S. alternative minimum tax and for certain international taxes. 71 Table of Contents Equity in Loss of Investees and Minority Interests Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2007 2006 Change Equity in Loss of Investees and Minority Interests $ 5,000 $ 3,554 40.7 % Equity in loss of investees and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, represented (1) minority interests associated with the ownership of priceline.com International that is held by former shareholders of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, including certain European-based managers of that business; and (2) equity in income (loss) of investees, principally comprised of our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results. The change in equity in income of investees and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the minority interest in the earnings of priceline.com International. Also, the prior year includes a $1.1 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment in pricelinemortgage.com to its estimated fair value. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2008, we had $463.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Approximately $181.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held by our international subsidiaries and are denominated primarily in Euros and, to a lesser extent, in British Pounds Sterling. Cash equivalents are primarily comprised of U.S. Treasury money market accounts and foreign government securities. Short-term investments are primarily comprised of U.S. and foreign government securities, highly liquid, investment grade corporate debt instruments and certificates of deposit. All of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter. This can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would indicate. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $315.6 million, resulting from net income of $193.5 million, non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $133.1 million and partially offset by $11.0 million of changes in working capital. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2008, were primarily related to a $48.0 million increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $37.0 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to growth in revenues, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The increase in allowance for doubtful accounts results primarily from recently experienced slower payment of agency commissions by hotels and to reflect the potential for increased losses resulting from the worldwide recession and the related impact on the financial health of our hotel partners. A majority of the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is related to increases in accrued affiliate commissions, deferred merchant bookings related to our merchant business and bonus accrual. Non-cash items were primarily associated with deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions of Travelweb, Booking.com Limited, Booking.com B.V., and Agoda. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $156.0 million, resulting from net income of $157.1 72 Table of Contents million and non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $18.9 million, partially offset by $19.9 million of changes in working capital. Net income included $55.4 million paid to settle litigation and $21.9 million received in excise tax refunds (see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the litigation settlement and excise tax refund) and a $1.2 million favorable litigation settlement related to credit card processing fees. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2007, were primarily related to a $33.4 million increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $9.8 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily due to significant revenue growth for our international operations. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased primarily due to a $5.3 million increase in bonus accruals and a $3.6 million increase in online advertising accruals. Non-cash items were primarily associated with deferred income tax benefit, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, primarily related to acquisition-related intangible assets. The deferred income tax benefit resulted primarily from the $47.9 million non-cash reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax valuation allowance, as well as a $3.6 million non-recurring income tax benefit resulting from the recognition of foreign capital allowance carry forwards in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net cash used in investing activities was $151.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Investing activities were affected by the purchase of $154.0 million of stock in priceline.com International held by minority interest shareholders, $1.2 million increase in restricted cash and acquisitions and other equity investments of $0.6 million. Investing activities were also affected by $22.2 million of net maturities of investments for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net cash used in investing activities was $221.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Investing activities were affected by $116.1 million of net purchases of investments for the year ended December 31, 2007, and the purchase of $76.1 million of stock in priceline.com International held by minority interest shareholders. Cash invested in purchases of property and equipment was $18.3 million and $15.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $168.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily related to $176.9 million of principal paid upon the conversion of senior notes, $4.4 million of treasury stock purchases, partially offset by $5.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $7.0 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily related to $19.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $3.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by $2.6 million of treasury stock purchases and $1.3 million of debt issuance costs. The following table represents the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 (see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 101,872 $ 19,458 $ 35,929 $ 34,738 $ 11,747 Convertible debt(1) 397,095 397,095 — — — Total $ 498,967 $ 416,553 $ 35,929 $ 34,738 $ 11,747 (1) At December 31, 2008 the Company’s convertible debt is a current liability because the contingent conversion thresholds on each of the Notes were exceeded. As a result, the Notes are convertible at the option of the holder. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Also includes interest payable on the Notes through 2009. 73 Table of Contents Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement periods during the three months ended December 31, 2008, the contingent conversion thresholds on each of our convertible senior note issues were exceeded. As a result, the notes (aggregate principal amount $393 million) are convertible at the option of the holder as of December 31, 2008 and, accordingly, have been classified as a current liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. Worldwide recession has increased the likelihood that certain holders, such as investment funds seeking liquidity to fund investor withdrawals, will elect to convert our convertible senior notes prior to maturity. In the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 1% Notes, $37.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes, $14.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2013 Notes and $30,000 of the 2.25% Notes were converted. We also received notices of conversion from the holders of approximately $8.0 million of the 2.225% Notes, which are expected to be settled in the first quarter of 2009. If holders elect to convert, we would be required to settle the principal amount of the notes in cash and intend to satisfy any conversion premium in shares of common stock. We would likely fund the repayment of the principal amount with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (totaling approximately $463.4 million at December 31, 2008) and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In September 2007, we entered into a $175 million five-year committed revolving credit facility with a group of lenders, which is secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our assets and related intangible assets located in the United States. In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the assets and related intangible assets of our material direct and indirect domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association’s prime lending rate and (b) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%; or at an adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.375%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $50.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, which are available in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility and we have issued approximately $2.3 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue growth or sustained profitability will be realized or that future borrowings or equity sales will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. 74 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk. The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2008. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2008, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future. As of December 31, 2008, the carrying value of our debt is approximately $393 million. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $742 million as of December 31, 2008. Substantially all of the market value of our debt in excess of the carrying value is related to the conversion premium on the bonds. As a result of the acquisitions of our European and Asian operations, we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily Euros and British Pounds Sterling). As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. As of December 31, 2008, derivatives with a notional value of 25.0 million Euros were outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, derivatives with notional values of 16.0 million Euros and 3.7 million British Pounds Sterling were outstanding. Foreign exchange gains of $4.3 million and losses of $3.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were recorded in “Foreign currency transactions and 75 Table of Contents other,” and were principally related to foreign exchange derivative contracts. We may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by such changes.",2023-12-30 18:44:21.092599
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors.” Overview We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services, including hotel rooms, car rentals, airline tickets, vacation packages, cruises and destination services. Internationally, we offer our customers hotel room reservations in over 90 countries and 32 languages. In the United States, we offer our customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase travel services in a traditional, price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique Name Your Own Price® service, which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at discounted prices. We launched our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to include, among others, the brands Booking.com worldwide and Agoda in Asia. Our principal goal is to be the leading worldwide online hotel reservation service. Our business is driven primarily by international results. During the year ended December 31, 2009, our international business — the significant majority of which is currently generated by Booking.com — represented approximately 61% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers), and approximately 75% of our consolidated operating income. Given that our international business is primarily comprised of hotel reservation services, commissions earned in connection with the reservation of hotel room nights has come to represent a substantial majority of our gross profit. Because our domestic services include merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services, which are reported on a “gross” basis, while both our domestic and international retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of Name Your Own Price® and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. At present, we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following sources: · Commissions earned from the sale of price-disclosed hotel room reservation, rental cars, cruises and other travel services; · Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our Name Your Own Price® hotel room, rental car and airline ticket services, as well as our vacation packages service; · Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our price-disclosed merchant hotel room service; · Global distribution system (“GDS”) reservation booking fees related to both our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room and rental car services, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and 54 Table of Contents · Other gross profit derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites. The worldwide recession continues to negatively affect the broad travel market and, as a result, our business. Since the onset of the worldwide recession, hotel operators have reported significant decreases in occupancy rates (a common metric that measures hotel customer usage) and average daily rates (“ADRs”) in the United States, Europe and Asia. While these trends have recently shown signs of stabilization, there can be no assurance that the worldwide recession will not worsen or continue or that the worldwide recession will not have further negative impact on the travel industry and, as a result, our business. Our recent performance has been aided by several factors that will likely not be present in future periods and, as a consequence, our year-over-year financial comparisons will be progressively more difficult in 2010, particularly in the second half of 2010. First, we believe our gross bookings and earnings growth rates reflected favorable year-over-year comparisons in the second half of 2009 due to weak economic conditions in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 (i.e., we began to see the effects of the worldwide recession on our business at the end of the third quarter 2008). Second, many travel suppliers have discounted or reduced their fares or rates, which we believe has helped to stimulate demand for leisure travel. We believe that these factors, among others, positively impacted our second half 2009 financial results and helped our business perform well in the wake of the world wide recession. We believe that these positive influences may not be present in future periods, which will make for less favorable – and progressively more difficult – year-over-year comparisons in 2010, particularly in the second half of 2010. For example, year-to-date in 2010, we have seen a deceleration in year-over-year hotel room night reservations as compared to the year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2009. In 2010, we expect year-over-year growth rates in hotel room night reservations to resume the pattern of deceleration we began to experience before the onset of the worldwide recession. Large, established Internet search engines with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic are creating — and intend to further create — inroads into online travel. For example, Google recently launched Google City Tours, an application that offers multi-day travel itineraries in destinations around the world, and Microsoft recently launched Bing Travel, a “meta-search” site, which searches for airfare and hotel reservations online and predicts the best time to purchase them. “Meta-search” sites leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the searcher’s specific itinerary across supplier, travel agent and other websites and, in many instances, compete directly with us for customers. These initiatives, among others, illustrate Google’s and Bing’s clear intention to more directly appeal to travel consumers by showing consumers more detailed travel results, including specific information for travelers’ own itineraries, which could lead to suppliers or others gaining a larger share of Google’s or Bing’s traffic or may ultimately lead to search engines maintaining transactions within their own websites. If Google, as the single largest search engine in the world, or Bing or other leading search engines refer significant traffic to these or other travel services that they develop in the future, it could result in, among other things, more competition from supplier websites and higher customer acquisition costs for third-party sites such as ours and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. International Trends. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have trailed those of the United States. However, international consumers are rapidly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. In addition, the base of hotel suppliers in Europe is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the top online hotel service provider in Europe. 55 Table of Contents As our international operations have become significant contributors to our results and international hotel bookings have become of increased importance to our earnings, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in certain of our operating expenses and other financial metrics. For example, because our international operations utilize online search and affiliate marketing as the principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our online advertising expense has increased significantly over recent years, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2010. In addition, and as discussed in more detail below, we have seen the effects of seasonal fluctuations on our operating results change as a result of different revenue recognition policies that apply to our price-disclosed services (including our international hotel service) as compared to our Name Your Own Price® services. Another impact of the growing importance that our international operations represent to our business is our increased exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Because we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States and are reporting our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency (principally the Euro and the British Pound Sterling) into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. Our international operations contributed approximately $852.0 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, which compares to $619.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 (year-over-year growth of approximately 37%). Revenue attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, however, by approximately 46% in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. Recently, the U.S. Dollar has strengthened against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. In general, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the local currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in decreased net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income. From time to time, we enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. Such derivative instruments are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross bookings, revenue or gross profit. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts. Domestic Trends. Competition in domestic online travel remains intense and traditional online travel companies are creating new promotions and consumer value features in an effort to gain competitive advantage. In June 2007, we eliminated processing fees for our price-disclosed airline ticket service, and in April 2008, we reduced processing fees for our domestic price-disclosed merchant hotel room service. As a result, since those dates, we had a pricing advantage against other major online travel agents with respect to these travel services. Starting in March 2009, Expedia also eliminated air booking fees. Later in March 2009, Travelocity matched the Expedia change and in April 2009, Orbitz followed. As a result, we no longer have the price advantage that we have had against our major competitors on price-disclosed airline tickets since June 2007. Similarly, in April 2009, each of Expedia and Orbitz reduced booking fees on hotel room reservations, and we therefore no longer have a price advantage over those companies on price-disclosed merchant hotel room reservations. In addition, in May 2009, Orbitz announced a price guarantee program under which a customer who books a prepaid hotel stay will receive money back from Orbitz if another Orbitz customer books the exact same stay in terms of room type, travel dates and number of travelers. In addition, in October 2009, Travelocity announced the waiver of its cancellation and change fees for hotel and vacation packages, as well as an expanded hotel guarantee, under which consumers who book a hotel room and then find a lower published rate for the same room anytime before the day of check-in are eligible to receive a refund of the difference. Our business may be adversely impacted as a result of no longer having a price advantage over our direct competitors in the U.S., as seen in the fourth quarter 2009, where domestic gross bookings growth decelerated from the previous quarter, and we may be adversely impacted by future promotional initiatives by our competitors. While demand for online travel services continues to experience annualized growth, we believe that the domestic market share of third-party distributors, like priceline.com, has declined over the last several years and that the growth of the domestic online market for travel services has slowed. We believe the decline in market share is attributable, in part, to (1) a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct 56 Table of Contents customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing, and (2) a price advantage in that the suppliers generally do not charge a processing fee. However, with the recent elimination and reduction of processing and other fees by all of the major online travel companies, we believe that the domestic market share of third party distributors has stabilized and potentially increased during 2009. In addition, recent decreases in domestic airline capacity, the threat of carrier bankruptcies and the emerging prospect of industry consolidation, as evidenced by the recent merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, could further reduce the amount of airline tickets available to us. Furthermore, we have recently observed a year-over-year decline in passenger traffic and airfares across the airline industry, which we believe is principally due to the worldwide recession and higher oil prices in 2008. Decreases in capacity and lower traveler demand negatively impact our domestic air business, which in turn has negative repercussions on our domestic hotel and rental car businesses. Our rental car business has been further impacted by recent decreases in rental car fleets, which have led to increases in retail rental car rates. Higher retail rental car rates negatively impact demand for our retail rental car service, while decreases in rental car availability negatively impact our Name Your Own Price® rental car service. In January 2010, Toyota recalled over 8 million vehicles due to faulty accelerator pedals, leading to further strain on rental car companies’ fleets and increased retail rental car rates. Despite these challenges, we continue to believe that the market for domestic online travel services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for growth. We also rely on fees paid to us by global distribution systems, or GDSs, for travel bookings made in the U.S. through GDSs for a portion of our gross profit and operating income. Connectivity to a GDS does not guarantee us access to the content of a travel supplier such as an airline or hotel company. We have agreements with a number of suppliers to obtain access to content, and are in continuing discussions with others to obtain similar access. If we were denied access to a suppliers’ full content or had to incur service fees in order to access or book such content, our results could suffer. We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our hotel business, to continue to promote the Booking.com brand internationally, the priceline.com brand in the United States, the Agoda brand in Asia and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into other international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, terrorist attacks, travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, increases in fuel prices, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel related accidents, unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes, or the withdrawal from our system of a major hotel supplier or airline, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above. For example, in 2008, civil unrest in Thailand, a key market for our Agoda business, negatively impacted booking volumes at the time, and future civil or political unrest would further disrupt Agoda’s business. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability. Seasonality. Our Name Your Own Price® services are generally non-refundable in nature, and accordingly, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking is generated. However, we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel services, including our international operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel. As a result, a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized as revenue until future quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which 57 Table of Contents bookings are generated. Therefore, if our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following: · Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Based on management’s assessment of positive and negative evidence, we recorded non-cash tax benefits in 2009 and 2007 of $183.3 million and $47.9 million, respectively, resulting from the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The deferred tax asset at December 31, 2009 amounted to $319.7 million. The valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change, causing a reassessment of the amount of deferred tax assets more likely than not to be realized. · Accounting for State and Local “Hotel Occupancy” Taxes. As discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently involved in approximately forty-five lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax) and our “merchant” hotel business. In addition, over fifty municipalities or counties, and at least two states, have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax). Additional state and local jurisdictions are likely to assert that we are subject to, among other things, hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax) and could seek to collect such taxes, retroactively and/or prospectively. Historically, we have not collected hotel occupancy or other taxes on the gross profit earned from “merchant” hotel transactions; 58 Table of Contents however, starting in September 2009, we are collecting and remitting occupancy tax in accordance with an amended ordinance for the City of New York. The ultimate resolution of these matters in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have established a reserve for potential resolution of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. We accrue for legal contingencies where it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated; our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount of the reserve. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of gross profit represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. The ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. · Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient’s service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance “contingency”) which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we periodically review actual and projected forfeitures. To the extent that actual or projected forfeiture rates differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised. · Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Booking.com earns agency commissions from hotel transactions and we are therefore subject to potential write-offs. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the age of the commission receivables, taking into consideration past experience and current trends. In addition, because we are the merchant of record in Name Your Own Price ® transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers. We are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs based upon past experience and current trends. · Valuation of Goodwill. We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired, principally including Booking.com. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded. 59 Table of Contents · Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value represents the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Accounting Standards Codification™ In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on its Accounting Standards Codification™ (“ASC” or “Codification”) and the hierarchy of U.S. GAAP. Effective July 1, 2009, the FASB launched the Codification which became effective for all interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Now effective, the Codification is the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental U.S. GAAP and supersedes all previously issued non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. The Codification as launched did not change U.S. GAAP but organized the accounting literature by topical areas in a user-friendly online research system. The Codification also includes relevant SEC guidance organized using the same topical structure. Specific changes that modify the Codification are communicated by the FASB by the issuance of an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”). During 2009 and early 2010, the FASB issued several ASUs that mostly entailed technical corrections to existing guidance or affected guidance to specialized industries or entities. With the exception of the 2010 accounting update that requires additional disclosure on fair value measurements, none of the ASUs to date have had an impact on us. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Noncontrolling Interests and Convertible Debt Settled in Cash On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard dealing with noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) that changed the accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. In connection with our acquisitions of Booking.com B.V. in July 2005 and Booking.com Limited in September 2004, key managers of these companies purchased shares of priceline.com International. In addition, these key managers were granted restricted stock and restricted stock units in priceline.com International shares. In September 2008, we repurchased all of the remaining outstanding shares underlying the noncontrolling interests so the adoption of this standard did not impact the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. This standard is effective for us on a prospective basis, except for presentation and disclosure requirements that are applied retrospectively. Concurrent with the adoption of the new accounting standard for noncontrolling interests, the accounting guidance required that redeemable noncontrolling interests be stated at fair value, with fair value adjustments recorded to equity, and reported as mezzanine (temporary equity) on the balance sheet on a retrospective basis for presentation purposes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of adopting this standard. On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard that impacts the accounting for convertible debt that may be settled in cash. This new standard requires cash settled convertible debt, such as our convertible senior notes, to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a 60 Table of Contents value assigned to each. The value assigned to debt is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature. The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this fair value, representing the value assigned to the equity component, is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond. In addition, if our convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity and the fair value of the debt component immediately prior to extinguishment is different from the carrying value, a gain or loss on extinguishment is recognized. This standard also requires that deferred financing costs be allocated between debt (amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method) and equity based on the allocations between debt and equity at debt issuance. Although this standard has no impact on our actual past or future cash flows, it requires us to record a significant amount of non-cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized. This standard requires retrospective application. See Notes 2 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of adopting this standard. Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2008, the FASB ratified a proposal that clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving entities that acquire or hold investments accounted for under the equity method. This accounting guidance is applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2009, we adopted a revised accounting standard associated with the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. This revised standard requires assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination to be recognized at fair value, at the acquisition date, if (1) the acquisition-date fair value can be determined during the twelve month measurement period or (2) during the twelve month measurement period it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent changes to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration are reflected in earnings until the contingency is settled. Also, contingent consideration arrangements of an acquiree assumed by the acquirer in a business combination will be recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The revised standard requires additional disclosures about recognized and unrecognized contingencies. This standard is effective for acquisitions made after December 31, 2008. The adoption of this standard will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis. On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard which provides new disclosure requirements for an entity’s derivative and hedging activities. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures about our derivative instruments. On January 1, 2008, we adopted certain provisions of a new accounting standard which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On January 1, 2009, we adopted the remaining provisions of this accounting standard as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. In April 2009, the FASB issued further clarification for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability had significantly decreased and for identifying transaction that were not conducted in an orderly market. This clarification of the accounting standard is effective for interim reporting periods after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. We adopted this clarification of the standard effective for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The adoption of the provisions of this new standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2010, the accounting requirements for fair value measurements were modified to provide disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2, separate detail of activity relating to Level 3 measurements, and disclosure by class of asset and liability as opposed to disclosure by the major category of assets and liabilities, which was often interpreted as a line item on the balance sheet. The accounting guidance also clarifies for Level 2 and Level 3 measurements that a description of the valuation techniques and inputs used to 61 Table of Contents measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques or inputs, if any, is required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. If the guidance issued in January 2010 is not adopted early, it is effective for the first reporting period, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide detail activity of Level 3 measurements, which will be effective beginning after December 15, 2010. We will adopt this 2010 guidance effective with the three months ended March 31, 2010. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on fair value measurements. In April 2009, the FASB extended the fair value disclosures currently required on an annual basis for financial instruments to interim reporting periods. This accounting literature also requires entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments on an interim and annual basis and to highlight any changes from prior periods. These new disclosures are effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. We adopted the new disclosure requirements effective for the three months ended March 31, 2009. See Notes 6 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the fair value of financial instruments. In April 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments that applies only to debt securities and shifts the focus from an entity’s intent and ability to hold until recovery to its intent to sell. If an entity intends to sell, or it is more-likely-than not that it will have to sell, impaired securities before recovery, the adjustment to fair value would be recognized through earnings. If an entity does not intend to sell the impaired debt security but it is probable that the entity will not collect all amounts due, then only the impairment due to credit would be recognized in earnings and the remaining amount of the impairment would be recognized in equity, in other comprehensive income but separately disclosed from other gains or losses on available-for-sale securities. The noncredit portion of the impairment for held-to-maturity securities will be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security. This change in accounting is effective for interim reporting ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009, and applies to existing and new investments held as of the beginning of the interim period in which it is adopted. The adoption of this standard, effective with the three months ended March 31, 2009, did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which requires entities to state in their periodic filings the date through which subsequent events were evaluated (either when statements were “issued” or “available to be issued”). The date when “issued” is when the financial statements are widely distributed to shareholders or other users for general use in a format that complies with U.S. GAAP. As a public entity, we are required to make this evaluation through the date that the financial statements are issued. This new standard is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted this standard for the six months ended June 30, 2009. In July 2009, the FASB ratified a proposal which deals with the accounting for own share lending agreements contemplated with the issuance of convertible debt. This new accounting guidance applies to equity classified arrangements and requires: (1) the share lender to record the fair value of the arrangement as issuance cost and to amortize the cost to interest expense over the duration of the arrangement; (2) to record a loss equal to the fair value of the shares if it is probable that the shares will not be returned or the share borrower will be unable to pay for the unreturned shares; and (3) to exclude from earnings per share calculations the loaned shares, unless there is an actual default. Additionally, the accounting requirements include certain disclosures about the arrangement. This accounting treatment is effective for new arrangements entered into in periods beginning on or after July 15, 2009. For all other share-lending arrangements, this accounting requirement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2009, with retrospective application for arrangements outstanding on the effective date. Since we do not currently have any share lending arrangements, this accounting guidance did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 62 Table of Contents In April 2008, the FASB issued guidance on determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The new guidance removed the requirement to consider whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost of material modifications to the existing terms and conditions and, instead, required an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements. This accounting guidance also expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives. The accounting guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and may impact any intangible assets we acquire in future transactions. In June 2008, the FASB ratified a proposal that addressed the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock. This accounting guidance is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2008, accounting guidance was issued for accounting for defensive intangible assets. A defensive asset is an acquired intangible asset where the acquirer has no intention of using, or intends to discontinue use of, the intangible asset but holds it to prevent competitors from obtaining any benefit from it. The acquired defensive asset is treated as a separate unit of accounting and the useful life assigned is based on the period during which the asset will diminish in value. This accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard may change our accounting treatment for future business combinations. In May 2008, the FASB issued an accounting standard which identified the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of non-governmental entities that are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This standard was effective November 15, 2008. The adoption of this statement did not result in a change in our current practices. In February 2007, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which permitted companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This standard required unrealized gains and losses to be included in earnings for items reported under the fair value option. This standard was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We did not elect the fair value option. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, reservations of hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services booked by our customers, and is widely used in the travel business. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings for our international brands and operations, and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings by our domestic operations, in each case without regard to the location of the travel or the customer purchasing the travel. 63 Table of Contents Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our domestic and international operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change Domestic $ 3.645 billion $ 3.082 billion 18.3 % International 5.665 billion 4.318 billion 31.2 % Total $ 9.310 billion $ 7.400 billion 25.8 % Gross bookings increased by 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, principally due to 49.3% growth in hotel room night reservations, partially offset by year-over-year declines in average selling prices for our hotel and airline ticket services in most markets. The 31.2% increase in international gross bookings was attributable to growth in international hotel room night reservations for our Booking.com and Agoda businesses. Domestic gross bookings increased by 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to growth in Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations, price-disclosed airline tickets, merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations and price-disclosed rental car days, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Gross bookings resulting from hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change Agency $ 7.191 billion $ 5.739 billion 25.3 % Merchant 2.119 billion 1.662 billion 27.5 % Total $ 9.310 billion $ 7.400 billion 25.8 % Agency gross bookings increased 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, due to growth in the sale of Booking.com hotel room night reservations, price-disclosed airline tickets and price-disclosed rental car days. Merchant gross bookings increased 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations, Agoda merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations and domestic merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Year Ended Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days Airline Tickets December 31, 2009 60.9 million 11.2 million 5.9 million December 31, 2008 40.8 million 10.0 million 4.9 million Hotel room night reservations sold increased by 49.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, over the same period in 2008, due primarily to an increase in the sale of Booking.com agency room night reservations, as well as an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® room night reservations and Agoda and domestic price-disclosed room night reservations. 64 Table of Contents Rental car days sold increased by 12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009, over the same period in 2008, due primarily to an increase in the sale of price-disclosed rental car days, as well as an increase in Name Your Own Price® rental car days. Airline tickets sold increased by 21.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009, over the same period in 2008, due to an increase in the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Revenues · Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and, among other things, select suppliers and determine the price we will accept from the customer. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations, rental cars and airline tickets and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel room reservations provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel room reservations and rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotel reservations; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. · Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. In June 2007, we eliminated processing fees on the priceline.com price-disclosed airline ticket service. · Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our travel business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of domestic point-of-sale travel services to a business that includes significant sales of international point-of-sale hotel services, a significant majority of which are currently generated in Europe. Because our domestic services include merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services, which are reported on a “gross” basis, while both our domestic and international retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of Name Your Own Price® and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations contributed approximately $852.0 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, which compares to $619.8 million for the same period in 2008. Revenue attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 46% in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. 65 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Merchant Revenues $ 1,447,576 $ 1,218,162 18.8 % Agency Revenues 868,395 648,792 33.8 % Other Revenues 22,241 17,852 24.6 % Total Revenues $ 2,338,212 $ 1,884,806 24.1 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 18.8%, compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations and rental car days, and Agoda and domestic merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 33.8% compared to the same period in 2008, primarily as a result of growth in our international operations. Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009 consisted primarily of advertising. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 24.6% compared to the same period in 2008, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues and increased traffic.

Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 16.0%, compared to the same period in 2008, due primarily to the increase in merchant revenue discussed above. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues in the U.S. and at Agoda are recorded in merchant revenues net of the amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there is no associated cost of revenues for merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of their associated merchant revenues decreased primarily due to the increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues, which are recorded on a “net” basis. Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. 66 Table of Contents Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Gross Profit $ 1,260,763 $ 955,971 31.9 % Gross Margin 53.9 % 50.7 % Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 31.9% compared to the same period in 2008, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, because Name Your Own Price® revenues, which are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of total revenues compared to retail, price-disclosed revenues which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $848.6 million of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009, which compares to approximately $615.8 million for the same period in 2008. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 46% in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Offline Advertising $ 36,270 $ 38,032 (4.6 )% % of Total Gross Profit 2.9 % 4.0 % Online Advertising $ 365,381 270,713 35.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 29.0 % 28.3 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, print and radio advertising; and (2) the cost for creative talent, production costs and agency fees for television, print and radio advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2009, offline advertising expenses decreased compared to the same period in 2008 due to lower production and creative talent costs, partially offset by increased television advertising. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2009, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2008, primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses to support increased price-disclosed agency hotel room night reservations booked by Booking.com as well as increased U.S. travel bookings, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Our international operations rely primarily on online advertising, in particular keyword purchases and payments to affiliate advertisers, to support their businesses. 67 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Sales and Marketing $ 81,238 $ 77,948 4.2 % % of Total Gross Profit 6.4 % 8.2 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate the call centers for our priceline.com business; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2009, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2008, primarily due to increased credit card processing fees and call center costs associated with increased gross booking volumes, partially offset by decreased bad debt provision and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in bad debt provision in 2009 was due to improved collection rates for agency commissions from hotels and the stabilization of economic conditions in general, and the hotel sector in particular as compared to 2008. Credit card processing fees in 2009 reflect a benefit of $1.0 million related to a litigation settlement with certain credit card companies. Personnel Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Personnel $ 180,152 $ 163,785 10.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 14.3 % 17.1 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2009, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2008, due primarily to increased compensation expenses associated with headcount growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change General and Administrative $ 68,555 $ 55,267 24.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 5.4 % 5.8 % 68 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2009, over the same period in 2008, due to additional fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses primarily related to hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings, and increased occupancy expenses associated with new Booking.com offices, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, we recorded a charge in the amount of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to a judgment in a lawsuit involving hotel occupancy taxes (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details). Information Technology Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Information Technology $ 19,139 $ 17,956 6.6 % % of Total Gross Profit 1.5 % 1.9 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) outsourced data center costs relating to our domestic and international data centers; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2008 was primarily associated with increased information technology expenses related to our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in information technology expenses related to our domestic operations. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Depreciation and Amortization $ 39,193 $ 42,796 (8.4 )% % of Total Gross Profit 3.1 % 4.5 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2009, depreciation and amortization expense decreased from the same period in 2008 by $3.6 million, primarily due to fully amortizing certain intangibles during the year ended December 31, 2008. 69 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Interest Income $ 2,223 $ 11,660 (80.9 )% Interest Expense (24,084 ) (34,853 ) (30.9 )% Foreign Currency Transactions and Other (6,672 ) 9,824 (167.9 )% Total $ (28,533 ) $ (13,369 ) 113.4 % For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest income on cash and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2008, principally due to lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to convertible debt conversions. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the effect on interest expense of adopting a new accounting standard that impacts the accounting for convertible debt that may be settled in cash. “Foreign currency transactions and other” includes foreign exchange losses of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and foreign exchange gains of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, related to foreign exchange derivative contracts. Foreign exchange losses of $2.9 million on transactions were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $0.3 million of gains for the year ended December 31, 2008. A loss of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulted from convertible debt conversions, compared to a gain of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, “Foreign currency transactions and other” includes a loss of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 to reflect a permanent impairment in the value of a corporate note included in long-term investments. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details about the adjustments to other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Income Tax Benefit (Expense) $ 47,168 $ (90,171 ) (152.3 )% Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was (10.7)% and 32.7%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, principally because it includes tax benefits of $183.3 million resulting from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryfowards. 70 Table of Contents Other items contributing to the difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 include lower foreign tax rates and the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt, partially offset by state income taxes. Due to our significant NOLs, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income for the foreseeable future. We expect to make cash payments for foreign taxes, U.S. state income taxes and U.S. federal alternative minimum tax. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details about the non-cash income tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2009, and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details about the adjustment to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2008. Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees $ 2 $ (310 ) (100.6 )% Equity in income (loss) of investees for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 represented our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results. In July 2009, pricelinemortgage.com was dissolved, and we received $8.9 million in cash for our 49% equity investment in pricelinemortgage.com. We do not expect the dissolution of our investment in pricelinemortgage.com to materially impact future periods. Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Noncontrolling Interests $ — $ 3,378 (100.0 )% Noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2008, represented income associated with the ownership of priceline.com International that was held by former shareholders of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, including certain European based managers of that business. In September 2008, we repurchased all of the remaining outstanding shares of priceline.com International and, as a result, there are no longer any noncontrolling interests in priceline.com International. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 71 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, reservations of hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services booked by our customers, and is widely used in the travel business. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings for our international brands and operations, and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings by our domestic operations, in each case without regard to the location of the travel or the customer purchasing the travel. Gross bookings resulting from hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our domestic and international operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change Domestic $ 3.082 billion $ 2.154 billion 43.0 % International 4.318 billion 2.675 billion 61.4 % Total $ 7.400 billion $ 4.829 billion 53.2 % Gross bookings resulting from hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change Agency $ 5.739 billion $ 3.585 billion 60.1 % Merchant 1.662 billion 1.244 billion 33.5 % Total $ 7.400 billion $ 4.829 billion 53.2 % Gross bookings increased by 53.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to 61.4% growth in our international gross bookings, virtually all of which relates to retail hotel room night sales (including the $316 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates). Domestic gross bookings increased by 43.0%, primarily due to growth in the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets (due in part to the elimination of booking fees in June of 2007), Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights and Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Agency gross bookings increased 60.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due to growth in Booking.com hotel operations and in the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets due in part to the elimination of booking fees in June of 2007. Merchant gross bookings increased 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights, the inclusion of room nights sold by 72 Table of Contents Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007, domestic merchant price-disclosed hotel room nights and Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Agoda gross bookings amounted to $118.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Hotel Room Rental Airline Year Ended Nights Car Days Tickets December 31, 2008 40.8 million 10.0 million 4.9 million December 31, 2007 27.8 million 8.6 million 2.9 million Hotel room nights sold increased by 46.9% for the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period in 2007, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Booking.com agency room nights, an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® room nights, the inclusion of merchant room nights sold by Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007, and an increase in the sale of domestic, price-disclosed room nights. Rental car days sold increased by 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period in 2007, due to increases in sales of both our price-disclosed and Name Your Own Price® rental car services. Airline tickets sold increased by 65.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period in 2007, due primarily to an increase in the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets due in part to our elimination of processing fees in June 2007 and increased marketing support. Revenues · Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and, among other things, select suppliers and determine the price we will accept from the customer. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® hotel rooms, rental cars and airline tickets and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotels; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. · Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. In June 2007, we eliminated processing fees on the priceline.com price-disclosed airline ticket service. · Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our travel business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of domestic point-of-sale travel services to a business that includes significant sales of international point-of-sale hotel services, a significant majority of which are currently generated in Europe. Because our domestic services include merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services, which are reported on a “gross” basis, while both our domestic and international retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an 73 Table of Contents increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations contributed approximately $619.8 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, which compares to $372.6 million for the same period in 2007. Approximately $11.3 million of this increase is due to favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007, accounted for approximately $17.0 million of the revenue attributable to our international operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Merchant Revenues $ 1,218,162 $ 1,002,824 21.5 % Agency Revenues 648,792 398,246 62.9 % Other Revenues 17,852 8,339 114.1 % Total Revenues $ 1,884,806 $ 1,409,409 33.7 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 21.5% compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room nights and airline tickets and the inclusion of revenues generated by Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2007, merchant revenues were positively impacted by an excise tax refund of $18.6 million (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our international operations contributed approximately $21.3 million to our merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, which compares to $5.6 million for the same period in 2007. Agoda contributed approximately $17.0 million of the merchant revenue attributable to our international operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 62.9% compared to the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of growth in our international operations, which contributed approximately $598 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008, and approximately $367 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $11.7 million of this increase is due to favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted primarily of advertising revenues. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 114.1%, compared to the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues due primarily to new advertising partner relationships added during 2007, increased traffic due in part to the elimination of booking fees on price-disclosed airline tickets in June 2007, and the inclusion of revenue generated by an online advertising company acquired in December 2007. 74 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Cost of Revenues $ 928,835 $ 769,997 20.6 % % of Revenues 49.3 % 54.6 % Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of Name Your Own Price® hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; and (3) the cost of Name Your Own Price® rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 20.6%, compared to the same period in 2007, due primarily to the increase in merchant revenue discussed above. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues in the U.S. and at Agoda are recorded in merchant revenues net of the amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there is no associated cost of revenues for merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, $(000) 2008 2007 Change Gross Profit $ 955,971 $ 639,412 49.5 % Gross Margin 50.7 % 45.4 % Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 49.5% compared to the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, because Name Your Own Price® transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to retail, price-disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2007, gross profit and gross margin were also positively impacted by the $18.6 million excise tax refund recorded in merchant revenue in the year ended December 31, 2007 (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $616 million of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2008, which compares to $369.0 million for the same period in 2007. Approximately $11.6 million of this increase is due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007, accounted for approximately $17.0 million of the gross profit attributable to our international operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. 75 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Offline Advertising $ 38,032 $ 35,963 5.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 4.0 % 5.6 % Online Advertising 270,713 172,676 56.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 28.3 % 27.0 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, print and radio advertising; and (2) the cost for creative talent, production costs and agency fees for television, radio and print advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2008, offline advertising expenses were higher than in the same period in 2007 primarily as a result of increased costs related to creative talent, television production and increased print and radio advertising, partially offset by decreased television advertising during the period. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2008, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2007, primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses to support significantly increased price-disclosed agency hotel room nights booked by Booking.com as well as increased U.S. travel bookings. The increase also reflects the inclusion of online advertising expenses related to price-disclosed merchant hotel room nights booked through Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007. Both Booking.com and Agoda rely primarily on online advertising, in particular keyword purchases and payments to affiliate advertisers, to support their businesses. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Sales and Marketing $ 77,948 $ 47,158 65.3 % % of Total Gross Profit 8.2 % 7.4 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate the call centers for our priceline.com business; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2008, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2007, primarily due to (1) increased gross booking volumes; (2) increased bad debt provision due to slower payment of agency commissions by hotels and to reflect the potential for increased losses resulting from the worldwide recession and the related impact on the financial health of our hotel partners; (3) increased credit card chargeback activity (including chargeback activity aggregating approximately $1.5 million in the first six months of 2008 associated with the bankruptcies of two of our airline suppliers); and (4) the inclusion of sales and marketing expenses related to Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007 and which has experienced higher customer chargeback activity than our other merchant services. 76 Table of Contents Personnel Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Personnel $ 163,785 $ 102,992 59.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 17.1 % 16.1 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2008, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2007, primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense, personnel expenses associated with head count growth of Booking.com, the acquisition of Agoda in November 2007, and increased employee performance bonus expense. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $16.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Stock-based compensation expense increased over the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the same period in 2007, due to headcount increases, higher stock prices at grant date and increases in the estimated probable number of shares to be issued upon completion of specified performance periods for our performance-based grants (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change General and Administrative $ 55,267 $ 91,837 (39.8 )% % of Total Gross Profit 5.8 % 14.4 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period in 2007, due to a $55.4 million expense related to a litigation settlement in 2007. Excluding the litigation settlement, general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2008, over the same period during 2007, due to additional fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses and expenses related to the evaluation of acquisition opportunities, increased occupancy expenses associated with new Booking.com offices, and the inclusion of general and administrative expenses related to Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007. 77 Table of Contents Information Technology Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Information Technology $ 17,956 $ 13,779 30.3 % % of Total Gross Profit 1.9 % 2.2 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) outsourced data center costs relating to our domestic and international data centers; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to outside consultants.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of increased amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives, depreciation and amortization related to investment increases in Booking.com, and the inclusion of depreciation and amortization related to Agoda, which we acquired in November 2007. Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Interest Income $ 11,660 $ 25,776 (54.8 )% Interest Expense (34,853 ) (38,574 ) (9.6 )% Foreign Currency Transactions and Other 9,824 (3,276 ) (399.9 )% Total $ (13,369 ) $ (16,074 ) (16.8 )% 78 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest income on cash and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2007, due to lower prevailing interest rates and investments in higher quality, lower yielding securities. In addition, interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 included approximately $3.3 million of interest received on our excise tax refund. Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the same period in 2007 due primarily to the conversion of approximately $176.9 million principal amount of convertible notes. Foreign exchange gains of $4.3 million and losses of $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were recorded in “Foreign currency transactions and other,” and were principally related to foreign exchange derivative contracts. In addition, “Foreign currency transactions and other” includes a loss in the amount of $0.8 million to reflect an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of a corporate note, included in long-term investments, and a gain of $6.0 million for debt conversions resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard related to convertible debt for the year ended December 31, 2008. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the adjustments. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Income Tax (Expense) Benefit $ (90,171 ) $ 23,537 (483.1 )% The provision for income taxes includes U.S. and international income taxes determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate. Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes non-cash tax benefits of (1) $47.9 million, resulting from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets and (2) $3.6 million resulting from the recognition of foreign capital allowance carryforwards. In addition, our effective tax rate differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% principally due to lower foreign tax rates and the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible stock-based compensation expense. Due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income for the foreseeable future. We expect to make cash payments for international income taxes, U.S. alternative minimum tax and certain U.S. state income taxes. Despite robust growth in our domestic earnings during 2008, the valuation allowance has not been reduced due to inherent uncertainty and the likely negative potential impact the current worldwide recession will have on our future operating results and future realization of our deferred tax assets. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details about the adjustment to income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Equity in Loss of Investees Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Equity in Loss of Investees $ 310 $ 321 (3.3 )% 79 Table of Contents Equity in loss of investees for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, represented our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results. Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2008 2007 Change Noncontrolling Interests $ 3,378 $ 4,679 (27.9 )% Noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, represented income associated with the ownership of priceline.com International that was held by former shareholders of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, including certain European based managers of that business. The change versus the prior year was primarily due to a reduction in the noncontrolling interests held by former shareholders of priceline.com International, partially offset by an increase in the earnings of priceline.com International. In September 2008, we repurchased all of the remaining outstanding shares of priceline.com International and, as a result, there are no longer any noncontrolling interests in priceline.com International. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2009, we had $800.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Approximately $534.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held by our international subsidiaries and are denominated primarily in Euros and, to a lesser extent, in British Pound Sterling. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of foreign government securities, U.S. Treasury money market accounts and U.S. government securities. All of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter. This can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would indicate. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $509.7 million, resulting from net income of $489.5 million and net favorable changes in working capital of $67.7 million, partially offset by a net unfavorable impact of $47.5 million for non-cash items not affecting cash flows. Non-cash items include the benefit of $183.3 million from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, primarily from acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization of debt discount and loss on conversions of our convertible notes. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2009, were related to an $86.8 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $22.8 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volume. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $315.6 million, resulting from net income of $185.6 million, non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $141.0 million and partially offset by $11.0 million of changes in working capital. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2008, were primarily related to a $48.0 million increase in 80 Table of Contents accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $37.0 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to growth in revenues, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The increase in allowance for doubtful accounts resulted primarily from slower payment of agency commissions by hotels and to reflect the potential for increased losses resulting from the worldwide recession and the related impact on the financial health of our hotel partners. A majority of the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities was related to increases in accrued affiliate commissions, deferred merchant bookings related to our merchant business and bonus accrual. Non-cash items were primarily associated with deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discount, gain on conversions of our convertible notes, and depreciation and amortization, primarily from acquisition-related intangible assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $501.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Investing activities were affected by $490.0 million net purchase of marketable securities, a payment of $5.0 million to settle derivative contracts and a payment of $1.5 million for acquisitions and other equity investments, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $8.9 million received in connection with the dissolution of pricelinemortgage.com and a reduction in restricted cash of $1.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $151.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Investing activities were affected by the purchase of $154.0 million of stock in priceline.com International held by noncontrolling interests, $1.2 million increase in restricted cash and acquisitions and other equity investments of $0.6 million. Investing activities were also affected by $22.2 million of net maturities of investments for the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash invested in purchase of property and equipment was $15.1 million and $18.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $169.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily related to $197.1 million of principal paid upon the conversion of senior notes, $17.4 million of treasury stock purchases, partially offset by $43.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $2.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $168.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily related to $176.9 million of principal paid upon the conversion of senior notes, $4.4 million of treasury stock purchases, partially offset by $5.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $7.0 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands) Less than 1 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than Contractual Obligations Total Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 43,640 $ 20,320 $ 16,139 $ 5,396 $ 1,785 Convertible debt(1) 197,639 197,639 — — — Total $ 241,279 $ 217,959 $ 16,139 $ 5,396 $ 1,785 (1) At December 31, 2009, our convertible debt is convertible at the option of the holder because the contingent conversion thresholds on each of the Notes were exceeded. Convertible debt represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and interest of $1.8 million for 2010. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement periods during the three months ended December 31, 2009, the contingent conversion thresholds on each of our convertible senior note issues were exceeded. As a result, the notes (aggregate principal amount $195.9 million) are convertible at the option of the holder as of December 31, 2009 and, accordingly, have been classified as a current liability and in convertible debt in mezzanine on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that 81 Table of Contents date. As of February 18, 2010, we have received conversion notices from holders of approximately $98 million outstanding principal amount that will be settled in the first quarter 2010. When holders elect to convert, we are required to settle the principal amount of the notes in cash and we intend to satisfy any conversion premium in shares of common stock. We would likely fund the repayment of the principal amount with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (totaling approximately $800.2 million at December 31, 2009) and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In connection with our acquisition of Agoda in 2007, contingent consideration of up to $141.6 million is payable in 2011 if Agoda achieves specified “gross bookings” and earnings targets for the period of January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010. In September 2007, we entered into a $175 million five-year committed revolving credit facility with a group of lenders, which is secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our assets and related intangible assets located in the United States. In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the assets and related intangible assets of our material direct and indirect domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association’s prime lending rate and (b) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%; or at an adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.375%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $50.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, which are available in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Pound Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility and we have issued approximately $2.4 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue growth or sustained profitability will be realized or that future borrowings or equity sales will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 82 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk. The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2009. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2009, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying value of our debt is approximately $195.9 million. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2009. Substantially all of the market value of our debt in excess of the carrying value is related to the conversion premium on the bonds. As a result of the acquisitions of our European and Asian operations, we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euros and British Pound Sterling). As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. As of December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding contracts for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we entered into additional derivatives with a notional value of 95 million Euros and 5 million British Pound Sterling. As of December 31, 2008, derivatives with a notional value of 25.0 million Euros were outstanding. Foreign exchange losses of $2.7 million, gains of $4.0 million and losses of $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were recorded in “Foreign currency transactions and other” related to foreign exchange derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2009, we had forward currency contracts with a notional amount of 183.4 million Euros to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary. These contracts are short-term in nature. Mark-to-market adjustments on these net investment hedges are recorded as currency translation adjustments. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we entered into additional derivatives as net investment hedges for 70 million Euros notional amount. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on our derivative instruments. 83 Table of Contents Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by such changes.",2023-12-30 18:44:22.512774
1075531,BKNG,Booking Holdings Inc.,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K. As discussed in more detail in the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors.” Overview We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers hotel room reservations at over 150,000 hotels worldwide through the Booking.com, priceline.com and Agoda brands. We offer international car rental reservation services through TravelJigsaw, which we acquired in May 2010. In the United States, we also offer our customers car rental reservations, airline tickets, vacation packages, cruises and destination services. We launched our business in the United States in 1998 under the priceline.com brand and have since expanded our operations to include, among others, the international brands Booking.com, Agoda and TravelJigsaw. Our principal goal is to maintain and grow our position as the leading worldwide online hotel reservation service, measured by room nights booked. Our business is driven primarily by international results. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our international business — the significant majority of which is currently generated by Booking.com — represented approximately 69% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers), and approximately 82% of our consolidated operating income. Given that the business of our international operations is primarily comprised of hotel reservation services, commissions earned in connection with the reservation of hotel room nights represents a substantial majority of our gross profit. Because our domestic services include merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services, which are reported on a “gross” basis, while both our domestic and international retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of Name Your Own Price® and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. At present, we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following sources: · Commissions earned from price-disclosed hotel room reservations, rental cars, cruises and other travel services; · Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservation, rental car and airline ticket services, as well as our vacation packages service; and · Transaction gross profit and customer processing fees from our price-disclosed merchant hotel room and rental car reservation services; · Global distribution system (“GDS”) reservation booking fees related to both our Name Your Own Price® airline ticket, hotel room reservation and rental car services, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and · Other gross profit derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites. 44 Table of Contents The recent worldwide recession negatively affected the broad travel market and, as a result, our business. At the onset of the worldwide recession, hotel operators reported significant decreases in occupancy rates (a common metric that measures hotel customer usage) and average daily rates (“ADRs”) in the United States, Europe and Asia. While these trends have recently shown signs of improvement, there can be no assurance that worldwide economic conditions will not worsen or have a negative impact on the travel industry and, as a result, our business. Over the last several years we have experienced strong growth in the number of hotel room night reservations booked through our hotel reservation services. However, given the sheer size of our hotel reservation business, we believe it is highly likely that our year-over-year room night reservation growth rates will generally decelerate on a quarterly sequential basis. For example, in the first quarter of 2010, we experienced a mild deceleration in year-over-year hotel room night reservation growth as compared to the year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2009. The unit growth rate decelerated further in the second quarter of 2010 due in part to (1) travel disruptions caused by the April 2010 eruption of a volcano in Iceland, (2) general uncertainty about the European economy and (3) substantial increases in airfares, which can negatively impact overall travel demand. As the volcanic activity subsided, macroeconomic concerns in Europe abated and airfare increases moderated, our third quarter year-over-year hotel room night reservation growth rate accelerated, and then reverted to the pattern of deceleration in the fourth quarter 2010. Additionally, an increasing amount of our business from a destination and point-of-sale perspective is conducted in markets that we have entered more recently and are growing faster than our overall growth rate, such as Asia-Pacific and South America. Ongoing efforts to improve the experience for customers on our web site and to add hotel supply also contributed to the strong performance in 2010. As our business grows in size, it becomes increasingly more difficult to maintain high growth rates and, therefore, we believe that our year-on-year room night reservation growth rates will generally, but not always, decelerate on a quarterly sequential basis in future periods. Large, established Internet search engines with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic are creating — and intend to further create — inroads into online travel, both in the U.S. and internationally. For example, Google recently announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire ITA Software, Inc., a major flight information software company, which could allow Google to pursue the creation of new flight search tools which will enable users to find flight information on the Internet without using a service like ours. Google has also invested in HomeAway, a vacation home rental service. In addition, Google has launched a travel “meta-search” site to show searchers specific hotels and rates in addition to text advertisements, and Microsoft has launched Bing Travel, a “meta-search” site, which searches for airfare and hotel reservations online and predicts the best time to purchase them. “Meta-search” sites leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the searcher’s specific itinerary across supplier, travel agent and other websites and, in many instances, compete directly with us for customers. These initiatives, among others, illustrate Google’s and Bing’s clear intention to more directly appeal to travel consumers by showing consumers more detailed travel search results, including specific information for travelers’ own itineraries, which could lead to suppliers or others gaining a larger share of Google’s or Bing’s traffic or may ultimately lead to search engines maintaining transactions within their own websites. If Google, as the single largest search engine in the world, or Bing, or other leading search engines refer significant traffic to these or other travel services that they develop in the future, it could result in, among other things, more competition from supplier websites and higher customer acquisition costs for third-party sites such as ours and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 45 Table of Contents International Trends. The size of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that within the United States. Historically, Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have trailed those of the United States. However, international consumers are rapidly moving to online means for purchasing travel. Accordingly, recent international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded, and are expected to continue to exceed, the growth rates within the United States. In addition, the base of hotel suppliers in Europe and Asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the United States, where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chains. We believe online reservation systems like ours may be more appealing to small chains and independent hotels more commonly found outside of the United States. We believe these trends and factors have enabled us to become the top online hotel service provider in the world. As our international operations have become significant contributors to our results and international hotel bookings have become of increased importance to our earnings, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in certain of our operating expenses and other financial metrics. For example, because Booking.com and Agoda utilize online search and affiliate marketing as the principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our online advertising expense has increased significantly over recent years, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2011. In addition, and as discussed in more detail below, we have seen the effects of seasonal fluctuations on our operating results change as a result of different revenue recognition policies that apply to our price-disclosed services (including our international hotel service) as compared to our Name Your Own Price® services. Another impact of the growing importance of Booking.com, Agoda and TravelJigsaw is our increased exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Because we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States and are reporting our results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency (principally the Euro and the British Pound Sterling) into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. Our international operations contributed approximately $1.4 billion to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, which compares to $852.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 (year-over-year growth of approximately 70%). Revenue attributable to our international operations increased on a local currency basis by approximately 77% in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the U.S. Dollar was stronger against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, relative to the fourth quarter of 2009, which negatively impacted the growth rates of our Euro and British Pound Sterling denominated gross bookings, gross profit and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars. In early 2010, Greece and certain other European Union countries with high levels of sovereign debt had difficulty refinancing that debt and central bank intervention was required, causing significant devaluation of the Euro relative to other currencies, such as the U.S. Dollar, and concerns that sovereign defaults could lead to devaluation or abandonment of the common currency. Sovereign debt issues could lead to further significant, and potentially longer-term, devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar, which would adversely impact our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars. In addition, many governments around the world, including the U.S. government, are operating at very large financial deficits. Disruptions in the economies of such governments could cause, contribute to or be indicative of, deteriorating macro-economic conditions. Furthermore, governmental austerity measures aimed at reducing deficits could impair the economic recovery and adversely affect travel demand. We generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. Such derivative instruments are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross bookings, revenue or gross profit. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivative contracts. Domestic Trends. Competition in domestic online travel remains intense and traditional online travel companies are creating new promotions and consumer value features in an effort to gain competitive advantage. For example, in 2009, Travelocity launched an opaque price-disclosed hotel booking service that allows customers to book rooms at a discount because, similar to our Name Your Own Price® hotel booking service, the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after purchase. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2010, Expedia began making opaque hotel room reservations available on its principal website under the name “Expedia Unpublished Rates.” If Expedia or Travelocity are successful in growing their opaque hotel service, our share of the discount hotel market in the U.S. could decrease. Online travel companies have also offered consumers value features such as, without limitation, the elimination and/or reduction of processing fees, the adoption of “best price” guarantees and the waiver of cancellation and change fees. The elimination of processing fees on retail airline tickets by us and our major competitors, coupled with the recent significant year over year increases in retail air fares, has led consumers to engage in increased shopping behavior before making a purchase. Increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness as traffic obtained through online advertising becomes less likely to result in a purchase on our web site. Therefore, online advertising expenses for our priceline.com U.S. business grew at a faster rate than gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010. Some travel suppliers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to develop technology to bypass the traditional GDSs, such as enabling direct connections to the travel suppliers or using alternative global distribution methods. For example, in December 2010, American Airlines terminated its participation in the Orbitz service and withdrew its fares from the Orbitz website. This is consistent with an effort on the part of American Airlines, and the airline industry in general, to reduce distribution costs. American Airlines’ termination of its distribution arrangement with Orbitz could be indicative of the airlines in general 46 Table of Contents becoming more aggressive toward requiring online travel agents to implement direct connections. In addition, in December 2010, Expedia preemptively removed American Airlines flights from its site as its contract with American was set to expire on December 31, 2010. It is feasible that a dispute between an airline and a GDS could lead to an airline removing its fares from the GDS. Despite the fact that such a dispute may not involve us, our business could be adversely affected if we are denied access to airfares in a major GDS. During 2010, we implemented a direct connection with American Airlines. Development and implementation of the technology to enable additional direct connections to travel suppliers could cause us to incur additional operating expenses, increase the frequency/duration of system problems and delay other projects. In addition, any additional migration toward direct connections would reduce the compensation we receive from GDSs. While demand for online travel services continues to experience annualized growth, we believe that the domestic market share of third-party distributors, like priceline.com, has declined over the last several years and that the growth of the domestic online market for travel services has slowed. We believe the decline in market share is attributable, in part, to (1) a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing, and (2) a price advantage in that the suppliers generally do not charge a processing fee. However, with the aforementioned elimination and reduction of processing and other fees by all of the major online travel companies, we believe that the domestic market share of third party distributors stabilized and potentially increased during 2009 and 2010. Domestic airlines have recently reduced capacity and increased fares. In addition, the threat of carrier bankruptcies and the emerging prospect of industry consolidation, as evidenced by the recent mergers of United Air Lines with Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines with Northwest Airlines, as well as the recently announced future acquisition of AirTran by Southwest Airlines, could lead to additional decreases in capacity and further reduce the amount of airline tickets available to us. Significant increases in average airfares thus far in 2010 may adversely impact travel demand. Reduced airline capacity and demand negatively impact our priceline.com air business, which in turn has negative repercussions on our priceline.com hotel and rental car businesses. Recent decreases in rental car fleets have led to decreases in rental car availability, which has negatively impacted our Name Your Own Price® rental car service. In addition, Avis is currently in discussions to acquire the Dollar-Thrifty Automotive Group. The merger or acquisition of the Dollar-Thrifty Automotive Group by Avis or another rental car company could result in a decrease of rental car reservations available to our rental car service. In January 2010, Toyota recalled over 8 million vehicles due to faulty accelerator pedals, leading to further strain on rental car companies’ fleets and increased retail rental car rates. As a result of these challenges, we experienced a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets and rental car days during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the market for domestic online travel services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for growth. 47 Table of Contents We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our hotel business, to continue to promote the Booking.com, Agoda and TravelJigsaw brands internationally and the priceline.com brand in the United States, and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into other international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions (such as the April 2010 eruption of a volcano in Iceland) or earthquakes and other weather phenomena, travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, increases in fuel prices, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel related accidents or the withdrawal from our system of a major hotel supplier or airline, could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above. For example, in early 2010, civil unrest in Thailand, a key market for our Agoda business and the Asian business of Booking.com, negatively impacted booking volumes in this market at the time. In addition, clashes involving Thai security forces, anti-government demonstrators and groups supporting the government resulted in violence in various locations in Bangkok, causing the temporary relocation of Agoda’s Thailand-based operations. Thailand has experienced disruptive civil unrest in prior years as well and continued or future civil or political unrest could further disrupt Agoda’s Thailand-based business and operations. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability. Seasonality. Our Name Your Own Price® services are generally non-refundable in nature, and accordingly, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking is generated. However, we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel services, including Booking.com and Agoda, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel. As a result, a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized as revenue until future quarters. In addition, revenue generated by TravelJigsaw transactions is recognized when the customer returns the rental car. From a cost perspective, however, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which bookings are generated. Therefore, if our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates 48 Table of Contents under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the following: · Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Based on management’s assessment of positive and negative evidence, we recorded non-cash tax benefits in 2009 of $183.3 million, resulting from the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2010 amounted to $222.0 million. The valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change, causing a reassessment of the amount of deferred tax assets more likely than not to be realized. · Accounting for State and Local “Hotel Occupancy” Taxes. As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently involved in over fifty lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax) and our “merchant” hotel business. We are also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to, among other things, the payment of hotel occupancy taxes and service fees. In addition, over fifty municipalities or counties, and at least nine states, have initiated audit proceedings (including proceedings initiated by more than forty municipalities in California), issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax). Additional state and local jurisdictions are likely to assert that we are subject to, among other things, hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax) and could seek to collect such taxes, retroactively and/or prospectively. Historically, we have not collected hotel occupancy or other taxes on the gross profit earned from “merchant” hotel transactions; however, in a handful of jurisdictions, we have been recently required by passage of a new statute or court order, to start collecting and remitting certain taxes (local occupancy and/or sales tax) imposed upon our margin and/or service fee. The ultimate resolution of these matters in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have established a reserve for potential resolution of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. We accrue for legal contingencies where it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated; our legal expenses for these matters are expensed as incurred and are not reflected in the amount of the reserve. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of gross profit represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. The ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. · Stock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation expense for equity-based awards over the recipient’s service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award. A number of our equity awards have performance targets (a performance “contingency”) which, if satisfied, can increase the number of shares issued to the recipients at the end of the performance period or, in certain instances, if not satisfied, reduce the number of shares issued to the recipients, sometimes to zero, at the end of the performance period. The performance periods for our performance based equity awards are typically three years. We record stock-based compensation expense for these 49 Table of Contents performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results. Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes charges amounting to $13.4 million, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share units. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we periodically review actual and projected forfeitures. To the extent that actual or projected forfeiture rates differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised. · Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Booking.com earns agency commissions from hotel transactions and because some commissions are not paid, we are therefore subject to potential write-offs. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the age of the commission receivables, taking into consideration past experience and current trends. In addition, because we are the merchant of record in Name Your Own Price ® and price-disclosed merchant transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers. We are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs based upon past experience and current trends. The ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the reserves recorded. · Valuation of Goodwill. We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques. In the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded. A substantial amount of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of Booking.com. The estimated fair value for Booking.com, as well as the Company’s other reporting units, is substantially in excess of their respective carrying values. Since the annual impairment test in September 2010, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate a potential impairment. · Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value represents the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. 50 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended accounting guidance concerning disclosure of supplemental pro forma information for business combinations. If an entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred in the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The accounting guidance also requires additional disclosures to describe the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments. This guidance is effective for business combinations consummated in periods after December 15, 2010, and should be applied prospectively as of the date of adoption. Early adoption of this guidance is permitted. In January 2010, the accounting requirements for fair value measurements were modified to provide disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2, separate detail of activity relating to Level 3 measurements, and disclosure by class of asset and liability as opposed to disclosure by the major category of assets and liabilities, which was often interpreted as a line item on the balance sheet. The accounting guidance also clarifies for Level 2 and Level 3 measurements that a description of the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques or inputs, if any, are required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. If the guidance issued in January 2010 is not adopted early, it is effective for the first reporting period, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide detail activity of Level 3 measurements, which will be effective beginning after December 15, 2010. We adopted this 2010 guidance effective with the three months ended March 31, 2010. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on fair value measurements. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Operating and Statistical Metrics Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking activity generated by our travel services. Specifically, reservations of hotel room nights, rental car days and airline tickets capture the volume of units purchased by our customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked by our customers, and is widely used in the travel business. International gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings for our international brands and operations, and domestic gross bookings reflect gross bookings generated principally by websites owned by, operated by, or dedicated to providing gross bookings by our domestic operations, in each case without regard to the travel destination or the location of the customer purchasing the travel. Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our domestic and international operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change Domestic $ 4.166 billion $ 3.645 billion 14.3 % International 9.480 billion 5.665 billion 67.3 % Total $ 13.646 billion $ 9.310 billion 46.6 % Gross bookings increased by 46.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, principally due to 52.3% growth in hotel room night reservations. The 67.3% increase in international gross bookings was attributable to growth in international hotel room night reservations for Booking.com and Agoda (growth on a local currency basis was approximately 73%). International gross bookings for the year ended December 31, 2010 include $185 million of TravelJigsaw gross bookings since its acquisition in May 2010. Domestic gross bookings increased by 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to increases in price-disclosed and Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations, and increases in average airline fares, and increases in price-disclosed and Name Your Own Price® rental car days. Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): 51 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change Agency $ 10.781 billion $ 7.191 billion 49.9 % Merchant 2.864 billion 2.119 billion 35.2 % Total $ 13.646 billion $ 9.310 billion 46.6 % Agency gross bookings increased 49.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, due to growth in the sale of Booking.com and priceline.com hotel room night reservations and an increase in average airline fares. Our U.S. agency hotel room reservations benefited from the integration of U.S. hotels from the Booking.com extranet into the priceline.com website. Merchant gross bookings increased 35.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, due to increases in the sale of Agoda merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations and priceline.com merchant price-disclosed and Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations and the inclusion of gross bookings from TravelJigsaw, which was acquired in May 2010. Year Ended Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days Airline Tickets December 31, 2010 92.8 million 16.3 million 5.9 million December 31, 2009 60.9 million 11.2 million 5.9 million Hotel room night reservations sold increased by 52.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010, over the same period in 2009, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Booking.com agency room night reservations, as well as an increase in the sale of Agoda price-disclosed room night reservations, priceline.com price-disclosed room night reservations and Name Your Own Price® room night reservations. Rental car days sold increased by 45.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010, over the same period in 2009, primarily due to the inclusion of rental car day reservations sold by TravelJigsaw, which we acquired in May 2010, and increases in the sale of priceline.com price-disclosed rental car day reservations. Airline tickets sold were flat for the year ended December 31, 2010, over the same period in 2009, as a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets was partially offset by a slight increase in price-disclosed airline tickets. Revenues We classify our revenue into three categories: · Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and therefore charge the customer’s credit card for the travel services provided. Merchant revenues include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations, rental cars and airline tickets and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with (a) the hotel room reservations provided through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service in the U.S. and at Agoda, and (b) the rental car reservations provided through our merchant semi-opaque rental car service at TravelJigsaw (which allows customers to see the price, car type and location of the reservation prior to purchase, but not the identity of the supplier); (3) customer processing 52 Table of Contents fees charged in connection with the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations. airline tickets and rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotel reservations; and (4) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the services listed above. · Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the agency services listed above and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue. · Other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites. Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Merchant Revenues $ 1,691,640 $ 1,447,576 16.9 % Agency Revenues 1,380,603 868,395 59.0 % Other Revenues 12,662 22,241 (43.1 )% Total Revenues $ 3,084,905 $ 2,338,212 31.9 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 16.9% compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Agoda and priceline.com merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations, Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations and the inclusion of TravelJigsaw since its acquisition in May 2010. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 59.0% compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of growth in the business of Booking.com. Our U.S. agency hotel room reservations benefited from the integration of U.S. hotels from the Booking.com extranet into the priceline.com website. Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of advertising. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 43.1% compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of the termination of a relationship with a post-transaction online advertising partner in September 2009. 53 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Cost of Revenues $ 1,175,934 $ 1,077,449 9.1 % % of Merchant Revenues 69.5 % 74.4 % Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2010, cost of revenues consisted primarily of charges from suppliers for: (1) the cost of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of Name Your Own Price® rental cars, net of applicable taxes; and (3) the cost of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 9.1%, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to the increase in merchant revenue discussed above. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues in the U.S. and for Agoda and merchant semi-opaque rental car reservations for TravelJigsaw are recorded in merchant revenues net of the amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there is no associated cost of revenues for merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of their associated merchant revenues decreased primarily due to the increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues and the addition of TravelJigsaw merchant revenues, all of which are recorded on a “net” basis. Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Gross Profit $ 1,908,971 $ 1,260,763 51.4 % Gross Margin 61.9 % 53.9 % Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 51.4% compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, because Name Your Own Price® revenues, which are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of total revenues compared to retail, price-disclosed agency and merchant revenues which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $1.4 billion of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010, which compares to approximately $848.6 million for the same period in 2009. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 77% in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. 54 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Offline Advertising $ 35,714 $ 36,270 (1.5 )% % of Total Gross Profit 1.9 % 2.9 % Online Advertising $ 552,140 $ 365,381 51.1 % % of Total Gross Profit 28.9 % 29.0 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, print and radio advertising; and (2) the cost for creative talent, production costs and agency fees for television, print and radio advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2010, offline advertising expenses were generally flat compared to the same period in 2009. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2010, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2009, primarily to support increased gross bookings for Booking.com, Agoda and priceline.com, as well as the inclusion of online advertising expense for TravelJigsaw since its acquisition in May 2010. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Sales and Marketing $ 116,303 $ 81,238 43.2 % % of Total Gross Profit 6.1 % 6.4 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-parties that provide call center, website content translations and other services; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2010, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2009, primarily due to increased credit card processing fees, third-party service costs and bad debt provision associated with increased gross booking volumes. 55 Table of Contents Personnel Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Personnel $ 270,071 $ 180,152 49.9 % % of Total Gross Profit 14.1 % 14.3 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2010, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2009, primarily due to increased headcount to support the growth of our business, higher bonus accruals reflecting our strong operating performance, and the inclusion of TravelJigsaw since its acquisition in May 2010. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes charges amounting to $13.4 million, representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period for certain outstanding unvested performance share units. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change General and Administrative $ 81,185 $ 68,555 18.4 % % of Total Gross Profit 4.3 % 5.4 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) personnel-related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 included a favorable adjustment of approximately $2.7 million in connection with the resolution of certain franchise tax and sales and use tax issues related to our corporate headquarters location and a charge of $1.7 million related to a court ruling in South Carolina (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details). General and administrative expenses for the same period in 2009 included a charge of $3.7 million related to a judgment in a lawsuit involving hotel occupancy taxes. Excluding these items, general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2010, over the same period in 2009, due to professional fees incurred in the second quarter 2010 related to the acquisition of TravelJigsaw, increased personnel-related expenses and occupancy expenses to support the growth in our Booking.com and Agoda operations, and the inclusion of TravelJigsaw since its acquisition in May 2010, partially offset by a decrease in litigation expenses primarily related to hotel occupancy tax and other tax proceedings. 56 Table of Contents Information Technology Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Information Technology $ 20,998 $ 19,139 9.7 % % of Total Gross Profit 1.1 % 1.5 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) outsourced data center costs relating to our domestic and international data centers; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2010, information technology expenses increased compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to growth in our worldwide operations. Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Depreciation and Amortization $ 45,763 $ 39,193 16.8 % % of Total Gross Profit 2.4 % 3.1 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2010, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the same period in 2009, primarily due to acquisition-related amortization in connection with our acquisition of TravelJigsaw. Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Interest Income $ 3,857 $ 2,223 73.5 % Interest Expense (29,944 ) (24,084 ) 24.3 % Foreign Currency Transactions and Other (14,427 ) (6,672 ) 116.2 % Total $ (40,514 ) $ (28,533 ) 42.0 % For the year ended December 31, 2010, interest income increased over the same period in 2009, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of cash and marketable securities invested. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, 57 Table of Contents primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt. “Foreign currency transactions and other” includes foreign exchange gains of $3.0 million and losses of $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to foreign exchange derivative contracts. Foreign exchange transaction losses including fees on foreign exchange transactions were approximately $6.1 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The early conversion of convertible debt resulted in losses of $11.3 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Income Tax (Expense) Benefit $ (218,141 ) $ 47,168 (562.5 )% Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was 29.2% and (10.7)%, respectively, and differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to lower foreign tax rates, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a benefit of $183.3 million, resulting from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards. Excluding the aforementioned $183.3 million benefit in 2009, the effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased over the same period in 2009, primarily due to a higher percentage of foreign income which is taxed at lower rates. Due to our domestic net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to make tax payments on our U.S. income for the foreseeable future, except for U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes. However, we expect to pay foreign taxes on our foreign income. We expect that Booking.com, Agoda and TravelJigsaw will grow their pretax income at higher rates than the U.S. over the long term and, therefore, it is our expectation that our cash tax payments will continue to increase as our international operations generate an increasing share of our pretax income. Effective January 1, 2010, the Netherlands modified its corporate income tax law related to income generated from qualifying “innovative” activities (the “Innovation Box Tax”). Earnings that qualify for the Innovation Box Tax will effectively be taxed at the rate of 5% rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25.5% (25% as of 2011). Booking.com obtained a ruling from the Dutch tax authorities in February 2011 confirming that a portion of its earnings (“qualifying earnings”) is eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment. The ruling from the Dutch tax authorities is valid from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013 (the “Initial Period”). In this ruling, the Dutch tax authorities require that the Innovation Box Tax benefit be phased in over a multi-year period. The Innovation Box Tax did not have a material impact on our 2010 results. In 2011, we expect the impact of the Innovation Box Tax to reduce our consolidated income tax rate by approximately one to two percentage points. The amount of qualifying earnings expressed as a percentage of the total pretax earnings in the Netherlands will vary depending upon the level of total pretax earnings that is achieved in any given year. In order to be eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment, Booking.com must, among other things, apply for and obtain a research and development (“R&D”) certificate from a Dutch governmental agency every six months confirming that the activities that Booking.com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are “innovative.” Should Booking.com fail to secure such a certificate in any such period -- for example, because the governmental agency does not view Booking.com’s new or anticipated activities as “innovative” -- or should this agency determine that the activities contemplated to be performed in a prior period were not performed as contemplated or did not comply with the agency’s requirements, Booking.com may lose its certificate and, as a result, the Innovation Box Tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated. After the Initial Period, Booking.com intends to reapply for continued Innovation Box Tax treatment for future periods. There can be no assurance that Booking.com’s application will be accepted, or that the amount of qualifying earnings or applicable tax rates will not be reduced at that time. In addition, there can be no assurance that the tax law will not change in 2011 and/or future years resulting in a reduction or elimination of the tax benefit. 58 Table of Contents Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2010 2009 Change Noncontrolling Interests Income $ 601 n/a n/a Noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2010, represents the proportionate share of the net income of TravelJigsaw Holdings Limited for the period of May 18, 2010 through December 31, 2010, applicable to the noncontrolling interests (refer to Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Operating and Statistical Metrics Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our domestic and international operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change Domestic $ 3.645 billion $ 3.082 billion 18.3 % International 5.665 billion 4.318 billion 31.2 % Total $ 9.310 billion $ 7.400 billion 25.8 % Gross bookings increased by 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to 49.3% growth in hotel room night reservations, partially offset by year-over-year declines in average selling prices for our hotel and airline ticket services in most markets. The 31.2%increase in international gross bookings was attributable to growth in international hotel room night reservations for our Booking.com and Agoda businesses. Domestic gross bookings increased by 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to growth in Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations, price-disclosed airline tickets, merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations and price-disclosed rental car days, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. 59 Table of Contents Gross bookings resulting from hotel room night reservations, rental car days and airline tickets sold through our agency and merchant models for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change Agency $ 7.191 billion $ 5.739 billion 25.3 % Merchant 2.119 billion 1.662 billion 27.5 % Total $ 9.310 billion $ 7.400 billion 25.8 % Agency gross bookings increased 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, due to growth in the sale of Booking.com hotel room night reservations, price-disclosed airline tickets and price-disclosed rental car days. Merchant gross bookings increased 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations, Agoda merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations and domestic merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Year Ended Hotel Room Nights Rental Car Days Airline Tickets December 31, 2009 60.9 million 11.2 million 5.9 million December 31, 2008 40.8 million 10.0 million 4.9 million Hotel room night reservations sold increased by 49.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, over the same period in 2008, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Booking.com agency room night reservations, as well as an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® room night reservations and Agoda and domestic price-disclosed room night reservations. Rental car days sold increased by 12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009, over the same period in 2008, primarily due to an increase in the sale of price-disclosed rental car days, as well as an increase in Name Your Own Price® rental car days. Airline tickets sold increased by 21.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009, over the same period in 2008, due to an increase in the sale of price-disclosed airline tickets, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Revenues We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our travel business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of domestic point-of-sale travel services to a business that includes significant sales of international point-of-sale hotel services, a significant majority of which are currently generated in Europe. Because our domestic services include merchant Name Your Own Price® travel services, which are reported on a “gross” basis, while both our domestic and international retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of Name Your Own Price® and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations contributed approximately $852.0 million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, which compares to $619.8 million for the same period in 2008. Revenue attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 46% in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. 60 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Merchant Revenues $ 1,447,576 $ 1,218,162 18.8 % Agency Revenues 868,395 648,792 33.8 % Other Revenues 22,241 17,852 24.6 % Total Revenues $ 2,338,212 $ 1,884,806 24.1 % Merchant Revenues Merchant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 18.8%, compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to an increase in the sale of Name Your Own Price® hotel room night reservations and rental car days, and Agoda and domestic merchant price-disclosed hotel room night reservations, partially offset by a decline in Name Your Own Price® airline tickets. Agency Revenues Agency revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 33.8% compared to the same period in 2008, primarily as a result of growth in our international operations. Other Revenues Other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009 consisted primarily of advertising. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 24.6% compared to the same period in 2008, primarily as a result of higher online advertising revenues and increased traffic. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Cost of Revenues $ 1,077,449 $ 928,835 16.0 % % of Merchant Revenues 74.4 % 76.2 % Cost of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2009, cost of revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of Name Your Own Price® hotel room reservations from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of Name Your Own Price® rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (3) the cost of Name Your Own Price® airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 16.0%, compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to the increase in merchant revenue discussed above. Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues in the U.S. and at Agoda are recorded in merchant revenues net of the amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there is no associated cost of revenues for merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of their associated merchant revenues decreased primarily due to the increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues, which are recorded on a “net” basis. 61 Table of Contents Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Gross Profit $ 1,260,763 $ 955,971 31.9 % Gross Margin 53.9 % 50.7 % Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 31.9% compared to the same period in 2008, primarily as a result of increased revenue discussed above. Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, because Name Your Own Price® revenues, which are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of total revenues compared to retail, price-disclosed revenues which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues. Because Name Your Own Price® transactions are reported “gross” and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business. Our international operations accounted for approximately $848.6 million of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009, which compares to approximately $615.8 million for the same period in 2008. Gross profit attributable to our international operations increased, on a local currency basis, by approximately 46% in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. Operating Expenses Advertising Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Offline Advertising $ 36,270 $ 38,032 (4.6 )% % of Total Gross Profit 2.9 % 4.0 % Online Advertising $ 365,381 270,713 35.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 29.0 % 28.3 % Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with domestic television, print and radio advertising; and (2) the cost for creative talent, production costs and agency fees for television, print and radio advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2009, offline advertising expenses decreased compared to the same period in 2008 due to lower production and creative talent costs, partially offset by increased television advertising. Online advertising expenses primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail campaigns. For the year ended December 31, 2009, online advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2008, primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses to support increased price-disclosed agency hotel room night reservations booked by 62 Table of Contents Booking.com as well as increased U.S. travel bookings, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Our international operations rely primarily on online advertising, in particular keyword purchases and payments to affiliate advertisers, to support their businesses. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Sales and Marketing $ 81,238 $ 77,948 4.2 % % of Total Gross Profit 6.4 % 8.2 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third-party service providers that operate the call centers for our priceline.com business; (3) provisions for credit card chargebacks; and (4) provisions for bad debt primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2009, sales and marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2008, primarily due to increased credit card processing fees and call center costs associated with increased gross booking volumes, partially offset by decreased bad debt provision and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in bad debt provision in 2009 was due to improved collection rates for agency commissions from hotels and the stabilization of economic conditions in general, and the hotel sector in particular as compared to 2008. Credit card processing fees in 2009 reflect a benefit of $1.0 million related to a litigation settlement with certain credit card companies. Personnel Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Personnel $ 180,152 $ 163,785 10.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 14.3 % 17.1 % Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2009, personnel expenses increased over the same period in 2008, primarily due to increased compensation expenses associated with headcount growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. 63 Table of Contents General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change General and Administrative $ 68,555 $ 55,267 24.0 % % of Total Gross Profit 5.4 % 5.8 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses; (2) occupancy expenses; and (3) personnel related expenses such as recruiting, training and travel expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2009, over the same period in 2008, due to additional fees for outside professionals, including litigation expenses primarily related to hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings, and increased occupancy expenses associated with new Booking.com offices, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, we recorded a charge in the amount of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to a judgment in a lawsuit involving hotel occupancy taxes (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details). Information Technology Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Information Technology $ 19,139 $ 17,956 6.6 % % of Total Gross Profit 1.5 % 1.9 % Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) outsourced data center costs relating to our domestic and international data centers; (3) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites; and (4) payments to outside consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the increase in information technology expenses compared to the same period in 2008 was primarily associated with increased information technology expenses related to our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in information technology expenses related to our domestic operations. 64 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Depreciation and Amortization $ 39,193 $ 42,796 (8.4 )% % of Total Gross Profit 3.1 % 4.5 % Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures. For the year ended December 31, 2009, depreciation and amortization expense decreased from the same period in 2008 by $3.6 million, primarily due to fully amortizing certain intangibles during the year ended December 31, 2008. Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Interest Income $ 2,223 $ 11,660 (80.9 )% Interest Expense (24,084 ) (34,853 ) (30.9 )% Foreign Currency Transactions and Other (6,672 ) 9,824 (167.9 )% Total $ (28,533 ) $ (13,369 ) 113.4 % For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest income on cash and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2008, primarily due to lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to convertible debt conversions. “Foreign currency transactions and other” includes foreign exchange losses of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and foreign exchange gains of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, related to foreign exchange derivative contracts. Foreign exchange transaction losses, including fees on foreign exchange transactions, were approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $0.3 million of gains for the year ended December 31, 2008. A loss of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulted from convertible debt conversions, compared to a gain of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, “Foreign currency transactions and other” includes a loss of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 to reflect a permanent impairment in the value of a corporate note included in long-term investments. 65 Table of Contents Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Income Tax Benefit (Expense) $ 47,168 $ (90,171 ) (152.3 )% Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was (10.7)% and 32.7%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 differs from the expected tax provision at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, principally because it includes tax benefits of $183.3 million resulting from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss. Other items contributing to the difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 include lower foreign tax rates and the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt, partially offset by state income taxes. Due to our significant NOLs, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income for the foreseeable future. We expect to make cash payments for foreign taxes, U.S. state income taxes and U.S. federal alternative minimum tax. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details about the non-cash income tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2009. Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees $ 2 $ (310 ) (100.6 )% Equity in income (loss) of investees for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 represented our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results. In July 2009, pricelinemortgage.com was dissolved, and we received $8.9 million in cash for our 49% equity investment in pricelinemortgage.com. We do not expect the dissolution of our investment in pricelinemortgage.com to materially impact future periods. 66 Table of Contents Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, ($000) 2009 2008 Change Noncontrolling Interests $ — $ 3,378 (100.0 )% Noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2008, represented income associated with the ownership of priceline.com International that was held by former shareholders of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, including certain European based managers of that business. In September 2008, we repurchased all of the remaining outstanding shares of priceline.com International and, as a result, there are no longer any noncontrolling interests in priceline.com International. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2010, we had $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Approximately $949 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held by our international subsidiaries and are denominated primarily in Euros and, to a lesser extent, in British Pound Sterling. We currently intend to permanently reinvest this cash in our foreign operations. We could not repatriate this cash to the U.S. without incurring additional tax payments in the U.S. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of foreign and U.S. government securities and bank deposits. In March 2010, we issued in a private placement $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2015, with an interest rate of 1.25%. Interest on these notes is payable in March and September of each year. The net proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repurchasing shares of priceline.com Incorporated common stock from time to time, repaying outstanding debt and corporate acquisitions. As discussed below, concurrent with this debt offering, we repurchased approximately $100 million of our outstanding common stock. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these notes. In March 2010, our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, including the approval to purchase up to $100 million of our common stock from the proceeds of, and concurrently with, the offering of the notes discussed above. We repurchased 461,437 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $106.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we have a remaining authorization to repurchase $459.2 million of our common stock. We may from time to time make additional repurchases of our common stock, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. Our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date. We therefore tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the volume of our business during the last few weeks of every quarter. This can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would indicate. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $777.3 million, resulting from net income of $528.1 million and net favorable changes in working capital of $50.9 million, and a net favorable impact of $198.3 million for non-cash items not affecting cash flows. Non-cash items include deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, primarily from acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization of debt discount and loss on conversions of our convertible notes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by $84.8 million, primarily related to higher deferred merchant bookings and accrued expenses as our business continues to expand. Other changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2010 include 67 Table of Contents an increase in other assets and liabilities of $17.8 million, principally related to an increase in long-term liabilities, partially offset by a $29.3 million increase in accounts receivable, and a $22.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the growth in the size of our business. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily related to the timing and amount of tax payments and increases in business volume. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $509.7 million, resulting from net income of $489.5 million and net favorable changes in working capital of $67.7 million, partially offset by a net unfavorable impact of $47.5 million for non-cash items not affecting cash flows. Non-cash items include the benefit of $183.3 million from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, primarily from acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization of debt discount and loss on conversions of our convertible notes. The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2009, were related to an $86.8 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $22.8 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in these working capital balances was primarily related to increases in business volume. Net cash used in investing activities was $841.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Investing activities were affected by $741.4 million net purchase of marketable securities and a payment of $112.4 million for acquisitions and other equity investments, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $35.0 million net proceeds from foreign currency forward contracts and a $0.3 million change in restricted cash. Net cash used in investing activities was $501.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Investing activities were affected by $490.0 million net purchase of marketable securities, payment of $5.0 million to settle derivative contracts and a payment of $1.5 million for acquisitions and other equity investments, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $8.9 million received in connection with the dissolution of pricelinemortgage.com and a reduction in restricted cash of $1.2 million. Cash invested in purchase of property and equipment was $22.6 million and $15.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $213.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million, $43.0 million of proceeds from the termination of conversion spread hedges, $25.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $3.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and proceeds of $4.3 million from the sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $295.4 million paid upon the conversion of senior notes, $129.5 million of treasury stock purchases and $13.3 million of debt issuance costs. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $169.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily related to $197.1 million of principal paid upon the conversion of senior notes, $17.4 million of treasury stock purchases, partially offset by $43.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $2.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Contingencies A number of jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against us related to, among other things, the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax). In addition, a number of municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes. To date, the majority of taxing jurisdictions in which we facilitate the making of hotel room reservations have not asserted that taxes are due and payable on our U.S. “merchant” hotel business. With respect to jurisdictions that have not initiated proceedings to date, it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statutes and seek to collect taxes from us only on a prospective basis. See Item 3 — Legal Proceedings 68 Table of Contents and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these pending cases and proceedings, and Item 1A Risk Factors — “Adverse application of state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation” in this Annual Report. We are vigorously defending against these claims and proceedings. However, litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse developments in these pending or future cases and proceedings. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of these actions or proceedings could result in substantial liabilities for past and/or future bookings, including, among other things, interest, penalties, punitive damages and/or attorney fees and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows in any given operating period. Also, there have been, and will continue to be, ongoing costs associated with defending our position in pending and any future cases or proceedings. To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have a tax collection responsibility, or we determine that we have one, with respect to future transactions, we may collect any such additional tax obligations from our customers, which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservations to our customers and, consequently, could make our hotels services less competitive (i.e., versus the websites of other online travel companies or hotel company websites) and reduce hotel reservation transactions; alternatively, we could choose to reduce the compensation for our services on “merchant” hotel transactions. Either step could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As a result of this litigation and other attempts by jurisdictions to levy similar taxes, we have established a reserve which amounted to approximately $26 million and $21 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The reserve is based on our reasonable estimate, and the ultimate resolution of these issues may be less or greater than the liabilities recorded. We believe that even if we were to suffer adverse determinations in the near term in more of the pending proceedings than currently anticipated given results to date, because of our available cash, it would not have a material impact on our liquidity. The following table represents our material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): Payments due by Period (in thousands) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 81,722 $ 20,400 $ 30,667 $ 11,947 $ 18,708 Convertible debt(1) 607,858 9,499 14,375 583,984 — Earnouts — acquisitions 64,636 64,636 — — — Redeemable noncontrolling interests 45,751 15,250 30,501 — — Total(2) $ 799,967 $ 109,785 $ 75,543 $ 595,931 $ 18,708 (1) Convertible debt represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and interest of $32.6 million. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) We reported “Other long-term liabilities” of $43 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010, of which approximately $26 million related to our reserve for potential resolution of issues related to hotel occupancy and other hotel-related transaction taxes (refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and $13 million related to unrecognized tax benefits (refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). A variety of factors could affect the timing of payments for these liabilities. We believe that these matters will likely not be resolved in the next twelve months and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability as “non-current” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have excluded “Other long-term liabilities” in the amount of $43 million from the contractual obligations table because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such payments. The contingent conversion threshold on the 2015 Notes was not exceeded at December 31, 2010, and therefore, that debt is reported as a non-current liability. The determination of whether the 2015 Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis. These notes may become convertible at the option of the holder prior to their stated maturity date of March 2015 if the closing price of our common stock exceeds the contingent conversion threshold for the prescribed measurement periods (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 69 Table of Contents In connection with our acquisition of Agoda in 2007, contingent consideration of up to $141.6 million was payable in 2011 if Agoda achieved specified “gross bookings” and earnings targets for the period of January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010. Based upon actual results for the three year period ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a liability and increased goodwill by $60.1 million. This treatment did not impact the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 2010. This amount will be reflected as an investing cash outflow when it is paid in 2011. In September 2007, we entered into a $175.0 million five-year committed revolving credit facility with a group of lenders, which is secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our assets and related intangible assets located in the United States. In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the assets and related intangible assets of our material direct and indirect domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association’s prime lending rate and (b) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%; or at an adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. Undrawn balances available under the revolving credit facility are subject to commitment fees at the applicable rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.375%. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $50.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, which are available in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lenders. The proceeds of loans made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility and we have issued approximately $1.6 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. There are no assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue growth or sustained profitability will be realized or that future borrowings or equity sales will be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies or repay our indebtedness. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 70 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk. The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2010. Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31, 2010, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future. However, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the fair value of our available for sale investments assuming an adverse change of 100 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis points (1.0%) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments as of December 31, 2010 of approximately $3.8 million. These hypothetical losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to their maturity. As of December 31, 2010, the outstanding principal amount of our debt is approximately $575 million. We estimate that the market value of such debt was approximately $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2010. A substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the carrying value is related to the conversion premium on the bonds. As a result of the acquisitions of Booking.com, Agoda and TravelJigsaw, we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (primarily Euros). As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Booking.com, Agoda and TravelJigsaw are subject to risks typical of international business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results. Our derivative contracts principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the Euro. As of December 31, 2010, derivatives with a notional value of 30 million Euros that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes resulting in a liability of $0.2 million are recorded in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Foreign exchange derivatives outstanding as of December 71 Table of Contents 31, 2010 associated with foreign currency transaction risks that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes resulted in an asset of $1.0 million, recorded in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding contracts for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Foreign exchange gains of $3.0 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008, respectively, and foreign exchange losses of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, were recorded in “Foreign currency transactions and other” related to foreign exchange derivative contracts. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a derivative liability balance of approximately $6 million as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had outstanding forward currency contracts with a notional value of 378 million Euros and 183 million Euros, respectively, to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary. These contracts are all short-term in nature. Mark-to-market adjustments on these net investment hedges are recorded as currency translation adjustments. The net fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2010 was a net liability of $2.8 million, with assets of $4.0 million recorded in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and liabilities of $6.8 million recorded in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Derivative assets at December 31, 2009 of $8.0 million are recorded in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a derivative liability of approximately $53 million as of December 31, 2010. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on our derivative instruments. Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility. To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, the Priceline Group would also be affected by such changes.",2023-12-30 18:44:21.402170
