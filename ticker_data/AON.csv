315293,AON,Aon plc,2004,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This Management's Discussion and Analysis is divided into six sections. First, an overview of the key drivers influencing our financial performance is provided by segment, along with an executive summary of 2003 financial results. Key recent events are then described that affected our financial results in 2003. Critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed, including certain accounting judgments important to understanding our financial statements. We then review our consolidated results and segments with year-to-year comparisons. Finally, we cover our financial condition and liquidity along with related disclosures as well as information on our off balance sheet arrangements. The outline for our Management's Discussion and Analysis is as follows: I. OVERVIEW Key Drivers of Financial Performance Executive Summary II.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Liquidity Cash Flows Financial Condition Investments Borrowings Stockholders' Equity Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 21 OVERVIEW Key Drivers of Financial Performance The key drivers of financial performance vary among our segments. Segments Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services. Brokerage segment results are affected by a number of key drivers, including (i) conditions in insurance markets generally (particularly fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies), (ii) success in attracting new clients and avoiding loss of existing clients, (iii) managing our expenses, (iv) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and (v) interest income on our investments. When premium rates rise in a ""hard market"", commissions generally increase as well. However, when insurance costs rise, insurance buyers resist paying increased premiums that include higher commissions. The resistance often results in buyers: •raising their deductibles •reducing the limits and types of insurance coverage they purchase •switching to negotiated fees or commissions instead of straight commissions •entering the alternative insurance market (which can also increase our revenues because we offer these services). Consulting. Consulting segment results are principally affected by (i) the employment levels of our clients that are mainly driven by economic conditions, (ii) governmental regulations affecting the health care market, employee benefit programs, and our clients' respective industries, (iii) success in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients, (iv) our success in cross selling services across business units, and (v) managing our overall level of expenses. Insurance Underwriting. Underwriting segment revenues are affected by (i) consumer buying habits that are influenced by economic conditions, (ii) our assumption of select commercial property and casualty insurance business particularly from our managing underwriting group in our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, (iii) competition with other underwriters (including competition based upon claims-paying ratings), (iv) success in selling new policies, upselling existing policyholders and the persistency of these policies and (v) investment results. Investment income is derived primarily from our fixed maturity investments and some short-term investments. These investments approximate net policy liabilities. Segment expenses are mostly benefits to policyholders that include reserve adjustments, sales commissions to agents and fees to distributors. Corporate and Other. The key driver of results in this segment has been investment income. For further information, see ""Corporate and Other"" in the Review by Segment section, below. Liquidity Liquidity is derived from cash flows from our business, excluding funds held on behalf of clients, and from financing and is used for capital expenditures, to repay debt, to fund acquisitions and pension obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders. Because we are a holding company, the receipt of dividend income from our subsidiaries may be affected by their ability to pay dividends (which, in the case of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries, is limited by regulatory and rating agency considerations). Tax considerations may affect access to cash generated from operations outside the United States, as can pension obligation decisions by trustees of international pension plans. 22 Executive Summary We are proud of the high quality of our services, the breath and depth of our intellectual capital and our product and service offerings, and the leading market positions that we have built. We believe our bottom line profitability, however, does not reflect the true potential of our organization. We are taking steps designed to improve margins that include: •Reviewing strategic alternatives for our non-core businesses, including the possible divestitures of our claims services businesses •Modifying our employee benefit programs •Leveraging our purchasing power with vendors, suppliers, and landlords •Prudently managing employee-related compensation and benefit expenses •Pursuing alternative resourcing strategies, such as outsourcing, to more efficiently provide non-client-facing services •Reviewing compensation arrangements with clients to improve the profitability of the valuable services we deliver •Offering additional services to existing clients who can benefit from our wide range of resources. In 2003, consolidated revenues grew 11% to $9.8 billion driven by solid demand for our services and products, along with the positive influence of foreign exchange rates. Furthermore, •Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services (previously called Insurance Brokerage and Other Services), our largest segment, exhibited good growth in most major business units. •Consulting revenues rose due to the full year impact of a large outsourcing contract, but were restrained by declining employment levels at many of our clients. •Our insurance underwriting business grew due to higher premiums within the warranty, credit and property & casualty lines. •Our accident, health and life lines are a lower growth business, and in 2003 revenue growth was constrained by the run-off of certain non-core businesses in Latin America, a large employer group life book in the U.S., and a specialty book in the U.K. •Our investment in Endurance Specialty stock and warrants increased our total investment income by $105 million over last year. Our pretax income from continuing operations and minority interest rose $286 million from 2002. Despite our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting margins declining, our overall pretax margin increased 190 basis points due to the increase in investment income from our investment in Endurance stock and warrants and the absence of $50 million of expenses in 2002 for the planned divestiture of our underwriting subsidiaries. We are, however, working to further improve our margins through greater financial discipline. Several factors that hurt our margins included: •increased defined benefit expenses for our major pension plans of $131 million •a significant decline in the pretax income of our claims services business of $48 million •increased adverse loss experience in a previously reported National Program Services, Inc. (NPS) run-off program of $29 million. 23 We are doing a better job of generating and managing our cash. More specifically, we: •paid down more than $300 million of long-term debt in 2003. At year-end, our total level of debt and preferred stock outstanding was 33% of our total capitalization, which is down from 40% at the beginning of the year. •made an early $100 million pension plan contribution in 2003. •reduced capital expenditure spending, which was down 33% from 2002. We are targeting even lower capital expenditures in 2004 as our major investments in businesses, systems and facilities are now largely complete. •reduced the amount we spent on cash acquisitions by 50% compared with 2002. Further discussion of these items may be found in the remainder of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. KEY RECENT EVENTS Segment Reporting, Reclassification and Cost Reallocation We classify our businesses into three operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services, Consulting, and Insurance Underwriting. A fourth segment, Corporate and Other, when added to the operating segments and after eliminating intersegment revenues, totals to the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. In 2003, certain business units were reclassified among segments. Certain administrative and marketing services relating to our insurance underwriting operations, previously included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, were reclassified into the Insurance Underwriting segment. Our automotive finance servicing business, previously included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage segment, was sold in fourth quarter 2003. Activity attributable to this business has been reflected in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income. Certain amounts in prior years' consolidated financial statements relating to segments and discontinued operations have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation. Also, beginning in 2003, we refined our methodology for allocating certain costs to the segments. For 2003, this revised cost allocation methodology reduced Consulting and Insurance Underwriting segment pretax income by approximately $16 million and $12 million, respectively, with the $28 million offset reflected in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. The revised methodology improves the assignment of costs, which are controlled on a centralized basis, to the operating segments. Run-off and Discontinuance of Certain Operations We are pursuing a ""back to basics"" strategy in the accident and health insurance business, and focusing on core products and regions. Therefore, in February 2003, we announced that we would be placing in run-off our accident and health insurance underwriting operations in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. In addition, we transferred to a third party our U.S. large employer group life and accidental death insurance business via an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. These lines of business generated approximately $14 million of revenues and $6 million of pretax losses in 2003, compared to $94 million of revenues and $22 million of pretax losses in 2002. In the United Kingdom in 2003, we decided to run-off certain non-core special risk accident and health business. This business generated $36 million of revenue with pretax income of $4 million in 2003. For 2002, we earned revenues of $37 million, generating pretax income of approximately $6 million. 24 In third quarter 2003, we decided to sell our automotive finance servicing business, which has been in run-off since first quarter 2001, and completed the sale in fourth quarter 2003 for net proceeds of approximately $18 million. Operating results from prior periods attributable to this unit have been reclassified as discontinued operations. Revenues from this business were $13 million in 2003 versus $15 million in 2002. The pretax loss recorded in 2003 of $55 million is comprised of operating losses of $32 million and a loss from the revaluation of the business of $23 million. In 2002, our pretax loss was $31 million. (See note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about this discontinued operation). We are evaluating options within our portfolio of other non-core businesses. In 2003, we announced that we were evaluating various strategic options for our claims services group. In early 2004, we reached an agreement in principle for the sale of two pieces of our claims services business in the U.K., and we are examining opportunities for the remaining claims units. World Trade Center To resume business operations and minimize the loss caused by the World Trade Center disaster, we secured temporary office space in Manhattan. Subsequently, we leased permanent space, and during first quarter 2003, we assigned this temporary space to another company. The 2003 costs relating to this assignment were $46 million pretax. In November 2003, we reached a final settlement of approximately $200 million for our overall World Trade Center property insurance claim and received a final cash payment of $92 million ($108 million received previously). This settlement resulted in a pretax gain of $60 million. This gain, and the $46 million expense discussed above, were combined and reported as a $14 million Unusual credit-World Trade Center in the 2003 consolidated statements of income. Endurance Warrants and Common Stock Investment In December 2001, Aon, primarily through its underwriting subsidiaries, invested $227 million in Endurance Specialty Holdings, Ltd., formerly known as Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd. (Endurance), a Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance company formed to provide additional underwriting capacity to commercial property and casualty insurance and reinsurance clients. As of December 31, 2003, the carrying value of our common stock investment in Endurance was $298 million, representing approximately 11.3 million shares. In conjunction with this common stock investment, we received approximately 4 million stock warrants, which allow us to purchase additional Endurance common stock through December 2011. These warrants meet the definition of a derivative as described in FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires them to be recorded in the financial statements at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each quarter. Through December 31, 2002, these warrants had been carried at zero value, which approximated their original cost. In first quarter 2003, Endurance completed its initial public offering, which provided a market value for the underlying shares and removed much of the uncertainty regarding the fair value of Endurance and the warrants. At December 31, 2003, we determined that the warrants had a fair value of approximately $80 million. This increase in value was recognized in investment income in the Corporate and Other segment. The future value of the warrants may vary considerably from the value at December 31, 2003 given the inherent volatility of the underlying shares, as well as the passage of time, and changes in other factors used in the valuation model. (See note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the valuation of the warrants.) 25 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Aon's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). To prepare these financial statements, we made estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect: •what we report as our assets and liabilities •what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. In accordance with our policies, we: •regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those concerning revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, policy liabilities (including future policy benefit reserves, unearned premium reserves and policy and contract claim reserves), restructuring costs, retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. •base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results allow us to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements. Pensions U.S. Plans Effective January 1, 2004, the U.S. pension plans were closed to new entrants. All new employees will participate in a defined contribution plan. Over time, this change will reduce the volatility inherent in the accounting for the U.S. pension plans. Aon uses a market-related value of assets to calculate pension expense. This value reflects a five-year average of the difference between the expected return on the market-related value of plan assets and the actual market value return. The prior year market-related value is projected to the current date by adjusting for contributions, benefit payments and expected returns. The asset gain or loss is the difference between the expected return on assets and the actual return on assets. Twenty percent of the asset gain or loss is recognized in the current year's market-related value, with the remaining eighty percent spread evenly over the next four years. As of year-end 2003, accumulated asset losses of $185 million have not yet been reflected in the market-related value of assets. These losses will increase pension expense as they are graded into the market-related asset value and may be offset by future asset gains. As of year-end 2003, we reported a fair value of pension assets of $929 million. At the same point in time, the market-related value of assets is $1,114 million. Under FASB Statement No. 87 accounting, the full gain or loss on assets and obligations are not recorded as expense in the current period. Statement No. 87 allows changes in the projected benefit obligation and market value of assets to be deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense over several years, based on the average expected future service of active employees, which is currently nine years. Gains and losses on pension obligations include the net effects of changes in the discount rate as well as demographic changes in the employee data. For the 2003 valuation year, the pension plans have a combined deferred loss of $496 million (comprised of unrecognized asset losses of $185 million and other than deferred asset losses of $311 million) that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements. Only the other than deferred asset losses of $311 million 26 outside of a corridor, defined as 10% of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation, is subject to amortization over a nine year period. For 2004, the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is $23 million. To the extent not offset by future gains, the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized. The investment policy for the pension plan provides for an allocation of assets to various asset classes. According to the policy, the percentage of total assets invested in each class should fall within a range. There is a target allocation for long-term investment decisions. However, the range provides flexibility to accommodate prevailing market conditions. In order to determine the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan, the historical performance, investment community forecasts and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plan. In setting the individual asset assumptions, the historical performance data series were weighted most heavily toward the geometric average returns. The expected returns for each asset class were then weighted by the target allocation of the plan. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used to determine pension expense was 8.5%. The result of the calculation based on the actual asset allocation for year-end 2003 is shown in the following table. The actual return for the 2003 valuation year (12%) was well in excess of the assumed return. Asset Class Allocation Range Target Allocation Historical Returns Weighted Average Expected Rate Of Return Equities 50 – 80 % 70% Domestic Equities 40 – 70 40 10.0 % 4.0 % Limited Partnerships and Other 2 – 20 10 10.9 1.1 International Equities 5 – 15 10 10.0 1.0 Real Estate and REITs 5 – 15 10 9.8 1.0 Aon Common Stock 0 – 5 No Target 10.0 — Debt Securities 20 – 50 30 Fixed Maturities 20 – 50 23 6.5 1.5 Invested Cash 2 – 15 7 2.5 0.2 Total 8.8 % There are several assumptions that impact the actuarial calculation of pension obligations and, in turn, net periodic pension expense in accordance with Statement No. 87. These assumptions require various degrees of judgment. The most significant assumptions are (1) the expected return on plan assets and (2) the discount rate. The same assumptions are used for Aon's pension plans and postretirement benefit plans. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense. For example, holding all other assumptions constant, a one percentage point decrease in our estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2004 pension expense and the estimated 2004 postretirement medical benefit expense by approximately $32 million and $1 million, respectively. A one percentage point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the estimated pension expense and the postretirement medical benefit expense for 2004 by approximately $28 million and $1 million, respectively. Similarly, holding other assumptions constant, a one percentage point decrease in Aon's estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 by approximately $11 million. A one percentage point increase in the estimated long-term rate of return would decrease pension expense by approximately $11 million for the same period. 27 Required cash contributions are also sensitive to assumptions, but assumptions used to determine contributions to the plan are changed infrequently. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate cash funding requirements of $28 million in 2004 and $236 million in 2005. Legislation being considered in Congress will relieve some of these requirements if passed. If so, contribution requirements are estimated to be $3 million in 2004 and $128 million in 2005. Major U.K. Plans For purposes of determining pension expense, the fair market value of plan assets is used. During 1999, the U.K. pension plans were closed to new entrants. All new employees became participants in a defined contribution plan. As with the U.S. plan, it is anticipated that this change will, over time, reduce the volatility of the accounting for U.K. pension plans. As with our other international plans, it is also important to note that the U.K. plans are solely obligations of subsidiaries of Aon Corporation. For the 2003 valuation year, the major U.K. pension plans have a combined deferred loss (from asset and liability experience) of $1,404 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements. Only the accumulated loss outside of a corridor, defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation, is subject to amortization over a period of approximately 17 years. For 2004, the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is $63 million. To the extent not offset by future gains, the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized. Generally, the trustees of the U.K. plans determine the investment policy for each plan. In the aggregate, at the end of 2003 the plans were invested 65% in equities and 35% in fixed income securities. In determining the expected rate of return, the redemption yields available on the type of fixed income securities (corporate and U.K. government securities) used in the pension plans are reviewed. For equity returns, the expectations of the investment managers for the next 10 to 15 years are considered taking into account projected rates of future inflation and real returns. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was 7.5%. With respect to U.K. pension liabilities, a one percentage point decrease in the Company's estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2004 U.K. pension expense by approximately $56 million. A one percentage point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the U.K. pension expense for 2004 by approximately $49 million. Similarly, a one percentage point decrease in the Company's estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the U.K. pension expense for the year ending December 31, 2004 by approximately $20 million. A one percentage point increase in the estimated long-term rate of return would decrease pension expense by approximately $20 million for the same period. Cash flow requirements are also sensitive to assumptions, but assumptions used for funding the U.K. plans are changed infrequently. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate U.K. funding requirements of $144 million in 2004 and $185 million in 2005. Such contributions reflect minimum funding requirements plus such other amounts agreed to with the trustees of the U.K. plans. Dutch Plan For purposes of determining pension expense, the fair market value of plan assets is used. At the end of 2003, the Dutch pension plan has a combined deferred loss of $125 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements. Only the accumulated loss outside of a corridor, defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation, is subject to amortization over a period of approximately 20 years. For 2004, the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is $5 million. To the extent not offset by future gains, 28 the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized. The target asset allocation is 35% equities and 65% in fixed income securities, with an allowed deviation of 5%. At year-end 2003, the actual asset allocation was 38% equities and 62% fixed income. The expected long-term rate of return assumption is 6%, which results from an expected future return of 8% on equities and a 5% return on fixed income investments. With respect to Dutch pension liabilities, a 25 basis point decrease in the Company's estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2004 Dutch pension expense by approximately $2 million. A 25 basis point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the estimated Dutch pension expense for 2004 by approximately $2 million. A one percentage point decrease in the Company's estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the pension expense for the year ending December 31, 2004 by approximately $3 million, while a one percentage point increase in the estimated long-term rate of return would decrease pension expense by approximately $3 million for the same period. At year-end 2003, the Dutch pension plan had a prepaid pension asset of $88 million. In the future, should the funded status of the plan deteriorate, such an amount could be reflected in a minimum pension liability, thereby reducing stockholders' equity. Contingencies We define as a contingency any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved. Under GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual issue. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each matter, or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. Policy Liabilities Through our insurance underwriting operations, we collect premiums from policyholders, and we establish liabilities (reserves) to pay benefits to policyholders. The liability for policy benefits, claims, and unearned premiums are some of the largest liabilities included in our statements of financial position. This liability is comprised primarily of estimated future payments to policyholders, policy and contract claims, and unearned and advance premiums and contract fees. To establish policy liabilities, we rely upon estimates for reported and anticipated claims, our historical experience, other actuarial data and, with respect to accident, health and life liabilities, assumptions on investment yields. We base interest rate assumptions on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Although mortality and interest rate assumptions are locked-in when we issue new insurance policies, we may need to provide for expected losses on a product by reducing previously capitalized acquisition costs established for that product, or by establishing premium deficiency reserves if there are significant changes in our experience or assumptions. The process of estimating and establishing policy and contract liabilities is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. While we made every effort to estimate these liabilities effectively, the results we report in our consolidated financial statements could be affected by trends which do not match historical experience 29 or which differ from our underlying assumptions. Furthermore, when our actual experience differs from our previous estimate, the difference will be reflected in the results we report for the period when we changed our estimate. We always consider trends in actual experience as a significant factor in helping us determine claim reserve levels. Intangible Assets Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses. We classify our intangible assets as either goodwill, client lists, non-compete agreements, future profits of purchased books of business of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries, or other purchased intangibles. Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, while goodwill is not subject to amortization. Allocation of intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and the determination of estimated useful lives are based on valuations we perform internally or that we receive from qualified independent appraisers. The calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results. Intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. While goodwill is not amortized, it is subject to periodic reviews for impairment (at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise). We review goodwill for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such impairment reviews are performed at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill. Under those circumstances, if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings. No such indicators were noted in 2003 and 2002. The determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results. 30 REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS General In the discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to supplemental information extracted from consolidated financial information which is not required to be presented in the financial statements by U.S. GAAP. Supplemental information related to organic revenue growth is information that management believes is an important measure to evaluate business production from existing operations. We also believe that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses, unusual items, and for the underwriting segment only, an adjustment between written and earned premium. The supplemental organic revenue growth information does not affect net income or any other GAAP reported figures. It should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, our consolidated statements of income. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they do not make identical adjustments. Aon has offices in more than 125 countries and sovereignties. Movement of foreign exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. dollar may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, management has isolated the impact of the change in currencies between periods by providing percentage changes on a comparable currency basis for revenue, and has disclosed the effect on earnings per share. Reporting on this basis gives financial statement users more meaningful information about our operations. Certain tables in the segment discussions show a reconciliation of organic revenue growth percentages to the reported revenue growth percentages for the segments and sub-segments. We separately disclose the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures, and transfers of business units, which represent the most significant reconciling items. Other reconciling items are generally not significant individually, or in the aggregate, and are therefore totaled in an ""all other"" category. If there is a significant individual reconciling item within the ""all other"" category, we provide additional disclosure in a footnote. 31 Summary Results for 2001 through 2003 The consolidated results of continuing operations follow: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Revenue: Brokerage commissions and fees $ 6,884 $ 6,187 $ 5,411 Premiums and other 2,609 2,368 2,027 Investment income 317 252 213 Total consolidated revenue 9,810 8,807 7,651 Expenses: General expenses 7,123 6,459 5,729 Benefits to policyholders 1,427 1,375 1,111 Interest expense 101 124 127 Amortization of intangible assets 63 54 158 Unusual charges (credits) — World Trade Center (14 ) (29 ) 158 Total expenses 8,700 7,983 7,283 Income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest $ 1,110 $ 824 $ 368 Pretax margin — continuing operations 11.3 % 9.4 % 4.8 % Consolidated Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Revenue In 2003, revenue increased 11% over 2002 to $9.8 billion. We saw improvements in brokerage commissions and fees, premiums earned, and investment income. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, revenue increased 6%. We do not directly hedge revenues against foreign currency translation because it is not cost effective, but we do attempt to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on pretax income through hedging strategies. Consolidated revenue by geographic area follows: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 % of Total 2002 % of Total 2001 % of Total Revenue by geographic area: United States $ 5,211 53 % $ 5,019 57 % $ 4,438 58 % United Kingdom 1,835 19 1,621 18 1,390 18 Continent of Europe 1,469 15 1,117 13 938 12 Rest of World 1,295 13 1,050 12 885 12 Total revenue $ 9,810 100 % $ 8,807 100 % $ 7,651 100 % U.S. consolidated revenue, which represents 53% of total revenue, increased 4% in 2003 compared to 2002, as a result of growth driven: •primarily by new business development and improved retention rates in both retail and reinsurance brokerage. •secondarily by revenue gains in the Consulting segment as the result of a large outsourcing contract that began in third quarter 2002. These gains were partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our Accident & Health and Life sub-segment that was primarily from transferring our 32 U.S. large employer group life and accidental death business to a third party via an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. While moderating, commercial property and casualty premium rate increases for most lines of coverage continued in 2003. As a broker, we benefit from this through increased commissions. In addition, client demand for risk retention programs and services contributed to this increase, especially reinsurance and wholesale brokerage. U.K. and Continent of Europe revenue combined increased 21% to $3.3 billion and Rest of World revenue increased 23%, reflecting a positive impact from foreign exchange, strong new business, and increasing premium and retention rates. Brokerage commissions and fees increased 11% to $6.9 billion as a result of: •the growth in new business •improved renewal rates for most of our businesses •the weakening U.S. dollar •higher revenue from a large consulting segment outsourcing contract begun in third quarter 2002. Premiums and other, primarily related to insurance underwriting operations, improved to $2.6 billion, a 10% increase over 2002. The increase reflects growth in some warranty and credit programs, along with specialty property and casualty lines, and favorable foreign exchange rates. Investment income increased by 26% over 2002, and includes related expenses and income or loss on disposals and impairments. The net increase reflects: •lower impairment write-downs in 2003 of $36 million compared with $130 million last year. 2002 impairment write-downs included a $51 million cumulative adjustment related to prior reporting periods. •a non-cash increase in the value of Endurance stock warrants of $80 million and equity earnings from our investment in Endurance common stock of $46 million. Equity earnings from our Endurance investment in 2002 were $21 million. •investment income in 2002 included interest on a tax-related settlement of $48 million with no corresponding amount in 2003. •lower investment income generated by the operating units of $81 million, including $27 million on deposit-type contracts, reflecting lower rates. Expenses Total expenses increased $717 million or 9% over 2002. General expenses increased 10% over 2002, reflecting: •growth of the businesses •the effect of foreign exchange rates •higher overall defined benefit pension plan costs of $131 million for our major plans. General expenses in 2002 included $50 million of costs from the planned divestiture of the insurance underwriting segment and a credit of $6 million reflecting the reversal of termination benefits previously incurred as part of the business transformation plan. 33 Benefits to policyholders rose $52 million, or 4%, primarily as the result of new business volume, and losses and reserve strengthening of $65 million related to NPS, a non-core book of runoff business. NPS was hired to handle quoting, binding, premium collection, claims adjusting, and other servicing related to general liability insurance policies issued by one of Aon's subsidiaries. We stopped NPS from initiating any new business on our behalf in mid-2002 after we obtained a temporary restraining order. We and others sued NPS for fraud, among other things. Benefit payout ratios have declined, however, due to a shift in product mix. Interest expense was down primarily due to lower debt levels. Amortization of intangible assets grew $9 million from 2002 due primarily to the impact of recent acquisitions as well as foreign exchange rates in the risk and insurance brokerage services segment. Total expenses also included a $14 million credit in 2003 and a $29 million credit in 2002 related to the World Trade Center. The 2003 credit represents a $60 million gain from a final settlement of our World Trade Center property insurance claim, net of $46 million related to the assignment to a third party of temporary office space secured in Manhattan after the World Trade Center was destroyed. The 2002 credit represents a gain resulting from a settlement with our insurance carriers regarding reimbursement for depreciable assets destroyed. Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax and Minority Interest Income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest increased $286 million in 2003 to $1.1 billion. Contributing to this increase were the impact of foreign exchange, the improvement in investment income ($65 million) and 2002 expenses related to the planned spin-off ($50 million) with no corresponding amount in 2003. Approximately 67% of Aon's 2003 consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest was from international operations. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 37% in both 2003 and 2002. The overall effective tax rate is higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily because of state income taxes. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations increased to $663 million ($2.08 per dilutive share) from $486 million ($1.71 per dilutive share) in 2002. Basic income from continuing operations per share was $2.08 and $1.72 for 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the fourth quarter 2002, we had a common stock offering, which increased the number of average common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding. After netting the effect of currency hedges, the positive impact of foreign currency translations was approximately $0.13 per share. We have deducted dividends paid for the redeemable preferred stock from net income to compute income per share. Discontinued Operations After-tax losses from our discontinued automotive finance servicing business in 2003 were $35 million ($0.11 per both basic and dilutive share). In comparison, losses in 2002 from this discontinued operation were $20 million ($0.07 per both basic and dilutive share). The 2003 results include an after-tax loss on the revaluation of the automotive finance servicing business of $14 million. Discontinued operations also include certain insurance underwriting subsidiaries acquired with Alexander and Alexander Services, Inc. (A&A) that are in run-off and the indemnification by A&A of certain liabilities relating to subsidiaries sold by A&A before its acquisition by Aon. There was no income statement impact from these discontinued operations in 2003, 2002 or 2001. 34 Based on current estimates, management believes that these discontinued operations are adequately reserved. The net liability is included as a component of other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position. In 2003 and 2002, Aon settled some of these liabilities. The settlements had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements. (See notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on discontinued operations.) Consolidated Results for Fourth Quarter 2003 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2002 Total revenues in the quarter rose 10% to $2.6 billion. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue climbed 4%. The higher revenue is primarily due to: •very good results from the international risk and insurance brokerage area, combined with improvement in U.S. brokerage and reinsurance •growth in new business and improved renewal rates •growth in some warranty and credit programs, along with specialty property and casualty lines •increased investment income in the Corporate and Other segment, reflecting the change in value of warrants we held in Endurance of $16 million. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest increased by $56 million or 19% over 2002. Both this and last year's results include settlements for various World Trade Center claims. The net change year-over-year for these settlements increased pretax income in 2003 by $49 million. This income growth was partially offset by: •an increase in costs for our major defined benefit pension plans, which increased the expense for the quarter by $34 million •a net charge in the warranty, credit, and property and casualty sub-segment of $44 million for additional losses and reserve strengthening for the NPS run-off program. Consolidated Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Revenue Total revenues were $8.8 billion, an increase of 15%. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 14% over the comparable period. This increase results from improvements in brokerage commissions and fees, premiums earned, and investment income. U.S. revenues, which represent 57% of total revenue, increased 13% in 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of strong organic growth resulting from: •commercial property and casualty premium rate increases •client demand for risk retention programs and services. U.K. and Continent of Europe revenues combined increased 18% to $2.7 billion and Rest of World revenue increased 19%, reflecting strong new business and increasing premium rates, which increase commissions, and foreign exchange. Brokerage commissions and fees increased 14% to $6.2 billion, primarily from organic growth including increased premium rates, increased new business, and outsourcing contracts. This growth was offset somewhat by revenue disruptions in the early part of the year with our managing general underwriter unit. Acquisitions contributed $90 million of incremental revenue in 2002. 35 Premiums and other increased 17% in 2002 to $2.4 billion. This increase primarily reflects growth in new business initiatives, traditional accident and health lines, and new specialty property and casualty lines. This increase was somewhat offset by the prior loss of some accounts in the warranty business. Investment income increased by 18% over 2001, despite a drop in interest rates. The increase was driven by: •improved returns on limited partnerships and other private equity investments accounted for on the equity method in 2002 •$48 million of interest income received from the settlement of a prior year tax issue. These improvements were offset by impairment write-downs for certain directly owned investments, including those classified as other-than-temporary, which were $73 million higher than the prior year. Investment income from our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting segments, primarily relating to funds held on behalf of clients, decreased $49 million compared to 2001, largely due to declining interest rates. Expenses General expenses increased 13% over 2001 reflecting: •growth of the businesses •higher costs in the U.S. retail brokerage business •increased risk management and litigation reserve items •higher overall pension plan costs •costs related to the planned spin-off. Benefits to policyholders rose $264 million or 24% due to new business volume increases, an increased payout ratio of benefits to policyholders versus net premiums earned, issues related to NPS and a shift in business mix to products with higher benefit payout ratios. Interest expense was down slightly due to lower short-term interest rates. Amortization of intangible assets declined $104 million from 2001 as goodwill was not amortized in 2002 in accordance with FASB Statement No. 142. Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax and Minority Interest Income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest increased significantly from $368 million in 2001 to $824 million in 2002. This increase is due primarily to the net change in expenses related to the World Trade Center ($187 million), the business transformation plan ($224 million) and the improvement in Corporate and Other revenue ($150 million). Approximately 76% of Aon's 2002 consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest was from international operations. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 39.5% for 2001 and 37% for 2002. The decline from 2001 was due to the non-deductibility of certain goodwill, which, beginning in 2002, is no longer amortized for book purposes. The overall effective tax rates are higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily because of state income tax provisions. 36 Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations increased to $486 million ($1.71 per dilutive share) from $183 million ($0.66 per dilutive share) in 2001. Basic income from continuing operations per share was $1.72 and $0.67 for 2002 and 2001, respectively. To compute income per share, we have deducted dividends paid for the redeemable preferred stock from net income. REVIEW BY SEGMENT General Aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services, Consulting, and Insurance Underwriting. (See note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.) Aon's operating segments are identified as those that: •report separate financial information •are evaluated regularly when we are deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We attribute revenues to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues. Segment revenue includes investment income, as well as the impact of related derivatives, generated by operating invested assets of that segment. Investment characteristics mirror liability characteristics of the respective segments: •Our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting businesses invest funds held on behalf of clients and operating funds in short-term obligations •In Insurance Underwriting, policyholder claims and other types of non-interest sensitive insurance liabilities are primarily supported by intermediate to long-term fixed-maturity instruments. Investments underlying interest-sensitive capital accumulation insurance liabilities are fixed- or floating-rate fixed-maturity obligations. For this business segment, operating invested assets are approximately equal to average net policy liabilities. •Our insurance subsidiaries also have invested assets that exceed net policy liabilities in order to maintain solid claims paying ratings. Income from these investments are reflected in Corporate and Other segment revenues. 37 The following tables and commentary provide selected financial information on the operating segments. (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Operating segment revenue: (1) Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services $ 5,677 $ 4,973 $ 4,363 Consulting 1,193 1,054 938 Insurance Underwriting 2,883 2,801 2,521 Income before income tax: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services $ 829 $ 791 $ 565 Consulting 108 120 126 Insurance Underwriting 196 155 168 Pretax margins: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services 14.6 % 15.9 % 12.9 % Consulting 9.1 % 11.4 % 13.4 % Insurance Underwriting 6.8 % 5.5 % 6.7 % (1)Intersegment revenues of $68 million were eliminated in 2003. See note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services Aon is a leader in many sectors of the insurance industry: globally, it is the second largest insurance broker, the largest reinsurance broker and the leading manager of captive insurance companies worldwide. In the U.S., Aon is the largest wholesale broker and underwriting manager. These rankings are based on the most recent surveys compiled and reports printed by Business Insurance. The devastation caused by the attacks of September 11, 2001 resulted in the largest insurance loss in history. At the same time, there was an unprecedented escalation of insurance premium rates because of larger than anticipated loss experience across most risks, the stock market's steep decline, lower interest rates, and diminished risk capacity. Higher premium rates, or a ""hard market,"" generally result in increased commission revenues. Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds. However, it is difficult to predict the longevity of the hard market, and the rate of increase in premiums in the property and casualty marketplace has already begun to level off. Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services generated approximately 58% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2003. Revenues are generated primarily through: •commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies •fees paid by clients •certain other carrier compensation •interest income on funds held on behalf of clients. Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of: •how our clients' policy renewals are timed •the net effect of new and lost business •the timing of services provided to our clients 38 •the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates. With the exception of employee incentives, expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year. Our retail brokerage companies operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with a large number of retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as individual brokers and agents and direct writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, this segment: •addresses the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of professional groups, insurance companies, service businesses, governments, healthcare providers, commercial organizations and non-profit groups, among others •provides affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income and personal lines for individuals, associations and businesses •provides wholesale brokerage, managing underwriting and premium finance services to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients •offers claims management and loss cost management services to insurance companies and firms with self-insurance programs •provides actuarial, loss prevention and administrative services to businesses and consumers. We review our product revenue results using the following sub-segments: •Risk Management and Insurance Brokerage—Americas (Brokerage—Americas) encompasses our retail and wholesale brokerage services, affinity products, managing general underwriting, placement and captive management services, and premium finance services in North and South America, the Caribbean and Bermuda. •Risk Management and Insurance Brokerage—International (Brokerage—International) offers similar products and services to the rest of the world not identified above. •Reinsurance Brokerage and Related Services (Reinsurance) offers sophisticated advisory services in program design and claim recoveries that: •enhance the risk/return characteristics of insurance policy portfolios •improve capital utilization •evaluate and mitigate catastrophic loss exposures worldwide. •Claim Services (Claims) offers claims administration and loss cost management services. The Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment revenues are influenced by the premiums paid by clients to insurers because we receive a percentage of the premiums as a commission in most cases. The availability of insurance coverage can also affect our revenues. If insurance coverage cannot be placed, we do not receive a commission. 39 Revenue Total 2003 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue was $5.7 billion, up 14% on a reported basis over last year. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, revenue rose 8% over last year. Operating revenue, on an organic basis, grew approximately 9% in a very competitive environment. Investment income decreased $34 million in 2003 from reduced derivative gains and lower interest rates. Continuing the trend from last year, increases in insurance premium rates benefited revenues in 2003. After September 11, 2001 insurance markets, whose premium rates were rising already, rose further as a result of restrictions on the availability of some coverages and the pressure on the financial strength of some insurance companies. The property and casualty insurance market is very competitive. As premium rates rise, clients often retain more risk. This dynamic has, and may continue to, limit revenue growth for pure brokerage services, but it provides opportunities to offer more captive insurance and claims management services, as well as safety and loss control services. This chart details Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue by sub-segment.

Organic growth in the wholesale business was under pressure due to pricing pressures. •Brokerage-International revenue showed strong improvement as a result of a favorable foreign exchange impact and strong organic growth. •Reinsurance revenue growth reflected strong results in U.S. reinsurance, driven by new business from existing clients and growth in renewal volumes, along with moderate growth internationally, as well as a favorable foreign exchange impact. •Claims revenue has increased over last year primarily as a result of a positive foreign exchange impact and higher U.K. volume. 40 This chart shows Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue by geographic area and pretax income: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Revenue by geographic area: United States $ 2,471 $ 2,368 $ 2,177 United Kingdom 1,172 1,055 890 Continent of Europe 1,112 849 726 Rest of World 922 701 570 Total revenue $ 5,677 $ 4,973 $ 4,363 Income before income tax $ 829 $ 791 $ 565 •U.S. revenue has shown a modest increase over 2002. The U.S. reinsurance business posted strong improvement as a result of new business and high renewal volumes. The managing underwriting group has recovered from very depressed results in the prior year. U.S. retail brokerage grew during the year, driven primarily by new business development and improved renewal rates. These increases, however, were partially offset by a decline in claims services revenue. •U.K. and Continent of Europe revenue increased primarily as a result of foreign exchange rates and organic revenue growth that reflected new business and good renewal rates. •Rest of World revenue increased significantly due to foreign exchange rates, increased market share primarily in the Asian markets, and new business initiatives. Income Before Income Tax Pretax income increased $38 million or 5% from 2002 to $829 million. The improvement in income was realized by the growth in revenues as well as a revised cost methodology which decreased centrally allocated costs by $28 million. In 2003, pretax margins in this segment were 14.6%, down from 15.9% in 2002. Our income and margins were impacted this year by: •additional pension expense of $109 million •a decline in claims services pretax income of $48 million •a decline in investment income of $34 million. In addition, some events did not hurt our income in 2003, but did affect our year-over-year comparison. These events include: •$29 million from a partial settlement in 2002 with Aon's insurance carriers related to the World Trade Center •a $6 million credit for the reversal in 2002 of business transformation plan expenses previously incurred for termination benefits with no corresponding amounts in 2003. Consulting Aon Consulting is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations. This segment: •provides a full range of human capital management services from employee benefits to compensation consulting 41 •generated 12% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2003. Consulting services are delivered to corporate clients through five major practice areas: 1.Employee Benefits advises clients regarding the structure, funding and administration of employee benefit programs which attract, retain and motivate employees. 2.Compensation focuses on designing salary, bonus, commission, stock option and other pay structures, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries. 3.Management Consulting assists clients in process improvement and design, leadership, organization and human capital development, and change management. 4.Communications advises clients on how to communicate initiatives that support their corporate vision. 5.Human Resource Outsourcing offers employment processing, performance improvement, benefits administration, and other employment-related services. Revenues in the Consulting segment are affected by changes in clients' industries, including government regulation, as well as new products and services, the state of the economic cycle, broad trends in employee demographics and the management of large organizations. Revenue In 2003, revenues of $1.2 billion increased 13% over 2002. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, the growth rate was 9%. Revenue on an organic basis grew 5% from last year. The organic revenue growth resulted from: •growth in U.S. compensation and international practices •the full year impact of a sizable human resources outsourcing agreement. In third quarter 2002, Aon entered into a sizeable new outsourcing contract with AT&T that is expected to provide favorable returns over the life of the multi-year agreement. The recognition of revenues and expenses, however, will significantly influence financial results over the contract period. Revenues are recorded on a gross basis, inclusive of amounts ultimately passed through to subcontractors, and are recorded ratably over the life of the contract. Up-front investment costs to support the new business cause pretax margins to be significantly lower in the early years of the multi-year contract, compared with the later years when margins are expected to increase. A significant portion of the up-front investment costs incurred for the new outsourcing contracts can be leveraged to handle increased business volume. This chart details Consulting revenue by sub-segment.

This increase was partially offset by a decline in management consulting. •Human resource outsourcing revenue improvement was due to the large contract initiated in third quarter 2002.

Income Before Income Tax Pretax income was $108 million, a 10% decline from last year. In 2003, pretax margins in this segment were 9.1%, down from 11.4% in 2002. Margins in this segment were reduced by: •a revised cost allocation methodology, resulting in higher expense allocations of $16 million over 2002 •increased pension and insurance costs •a non-recurring stock-based expense adjustment. The pretax margins for 2003 were also influenced by a lower margin human resources outsourcing contract, as discussed above. 43 Insurance Underwriting The Insurance Underwriting segment: •provides supplemental accident, health and life insurance coverage mostly through direct distribution networks, primarily through more than 7,600 career insurance agents working for our subsidiaries. Our revenues are affected by our success in attracting and retaining these career agents. The agency force turnover has remained fairly stable over time. The sales management team is a strength that enables the recruiting model to remain effective. •provides supplemental Medicare policies in the U.S. through a dedicated sales force •offers extended warranty and credit insurance products that are sold through retailers, automotive dealers, insurance agents and brokers, and real estate brokers. Our revenues are also affected by the addition and retention of these retailers, dealers, agents and brokers. •offers select commercial property and casualty business on a limited basis through managing general underwriters, primarily Aon-owned companies •provides the administration of certain extended warranty services on automobiles, electronic goods, personal computers and appliances •has operations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Pacific •generated approximately 30% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2003. In the accident, health and life operations, we provide an array of accident, sickness, short-term disability and other supplemental insurance products. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations, and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation. We have: •developed relationships with select brokers and consultants to reach specific niche markets •expanded product distribution to include direct response programs, affinity groups, and worksite marketing, which has created access to new markets and potential new policyholders •implemented a ""back-to-basics"" strategy, focusing on products and regions with predictable cash flows and the best return on investment •announced plans in February 2003 to place in run-off our accident and health insurance underwriting operations in Latin America. We stopped operations in Argentina and have transitioned into run-off status in Brazil and Mexico during 2003. •transferred the large employer group life and accidental death business to a third party via an indemnity reinsurance arrangement •decided to run off certain non-core special risk accident and health business in the U.K. Our warranty and credit subsidiaries in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Pacific provide warranties on automobiles and a variety of consumer goods, including electronics and appliances. In addition, we provide non-structural home warranties and other warranty products, such as credit card enhancements and affinity warranty programs. Revenue Written premiums and fees are the basis for organic revenue growth in this segment; however, reported revenues reflect earned premiums. 44 A table reflecting written and earned premiums and associated reserves follows: 2003 2002 Written premiums: Accident & Health and Life $ 1,460 $ 1,519 Warranty and Credit 986 828 Property & Casualty 221 164 Total Warranty, Credit, Property & Casualty 1,207 992 Total Insurance Underwriting $ 2,667 $ 2,511 Earned premiums: Accident & Health and Life $ 1,502 $ 1,494 Warranty and Credit 830 733 Property & Casualty 217 133 Total Warranty, Credit, Property & Casualty 1,047 866 Total Insurance Underwriting $ 2,549 $ 2,360 Policy and Contract Claims: Accident & Health $ 447 $ 421 Warranty and Credit 207 177 Property & Casualty 955 653 Total Warranty, Credit, Property & Casualty 1,162 830 Total Insurance Underwriting $ 1,609 $ 1,251 In 2003, revenues of $2.9 billion increased 3% over 2002.

The change in warranty and total revenue also resulted from a one-time assumption of premiums ceded from a client's captive in 2002. 45 •Revenue declined in accident & health and life for 2003 primarily due to our decision to: —pursue a ""back-to-basics"" strategy in the core businesses —run off the accident and health insurance underwriting operations in the Latin American countries and to transfer our U.S. large employer group life business. These businesses generated approximately $14 million of revenues and $6 million of pretax losses in 2003 compared to $94 million in revenues and $22 million of pretax losses in 2002. We are exiting these businesses and expect to completely withdraw in 2005. We also decided to run off certain non-core special risk accident and health business in the U.K. •Growth in the select property and casualty business, as well European credit and warranty programs, drove the revenue improvement in warranty, credit and property & casualty. Overall core business growth was partially offset by: •a decline in investment income of $47 million, significantly impacted by a $27 million decline in interest earned on investments underlying deposit-type contracts, as that business has been placed in run-off •overall lower interest rates. This chart details Insurance Underwriting revenue by geographic area and pretax income: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Revenue by geographic area: United States $ 1,953 $ 2,005 $ 1,838 United Kingdom 460 395 330 Continent of Europe 211 159 132 Rest of World 259 242 221 Total revenue $ 2,883 $ 2,801 $ 2,521 Income before income taxes $ 196 $ 155 $ 168 •In 2003, U.S. revenue declined primarily as a result of the runoff of our U.S. large employer group life and accidental death business. •U.K., Continent of Europe, and Rest of World posted significant revenue improvement during the year. This increase is primarily the result of a favorable currency exchange rate impact and organic revenue growth in European direct sales, warranty and credit operations. Income Before Income Tax Pretax income of $196 million increased 26% from 2002. Pretax margins rose from 5.5% in 2002 to 6.8% in 2003. Increased pretax income and margin resulted from: •higher expenses and charges concerning the planned divestiture of the Insurance Underwriting segment of $33 million in 2002, with no corresponding amounts in 2003 •improved profitability in the traditional lines of accident & health and life •provision for non-claims litigation issues of $15 million in 2002, with no corresponding amount in 2003 •reduced losses in Europe warranty and improvements in property & casualty, excluding NPS. 46 These increases were partially offset by: •charges related to losses and reserve strengthening for the NPS run-off program, which were $65 million in 2003 versus a $36 million charge in 2002 •a revised cost allocation methodology, which resulted in increased expense allocations of $12 million for 2003. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other segment revenue consists primarily of investment income (including income or loss on disposals, including other-than-temporary impairment losses), which is not otherwise reflected in the operating segments. This segment includes: •invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting businesses •the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries and related income. Corporate and Other segment revenue includes income from Endurance common stock, accounted for under the equity method, and changes in the valuation of Endurance warrants. Aon carries its investment in Endurance warrants at fair value and records changes in the fair value through Corporate and Other segment revenue, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 133. Private equities are principally carried at cost except where Aon has significant influence, in which case they are carried under the equity method. These investments usually do not pay dividends. Limited partnerships (LP) are accounted for under the equity method and changes in the value of the underlying LP investments flow through Corporate and Other segment revenue. Because the LP investments include exchange-traded securities, Corporate and Other segment revenue fluctuates with the market values of underlying publicly traded equity investments. LP investments have historically provided higher returns over a longer time than broad market common stock. However, in the short run, the returns are inherently more variable. In December 2001, we securitized $450 million of our LP investments plus associated LP commitments, which represented the majority of our LP interests. This transaction has lessened the variability of revenue reported in this segment. (See note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization.) Although our portfolios are highly diversified, they still remain exposed to market, equity, and credit risk. We: •periodically review securities with material unrealized losses and evaluate them for other-than- temporary impairments. •analyze various risk factors and determine if any specific asset impairments exist. If we determine there is a specific asset impairment, we recognize a realized loss and adjust the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value. •review invested assets with material unrealized losses each quarter. (See note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding other-than-temporary impairments.) 47 This chart shows the components of Corporate and Other revenue and expenses: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Revenue: Income from marketable equity securities and other investments $ 137 $ 31 $ 7 Limited partnership investments 1 14 (94 ) Interest on tax refund — 48 — Net loss on disposals and related expenses (13 ) (114 ) (84 ) Total revenue $ 125 $ (21 ) $ (171 ) Expenses: General expenses $ 61 $ 97 $ 75 Interest expense 101 124 127 Amortization of goodwill — — 118 Unusual credits — World Trade Center (14 ) — — Total expenses 148 221 320 Loss before income tax $ (23 ) $ (242 ) $ (491 ) Revenue Corporate and Other revenue improved by $146 million to $125 million in 2003. The revenue improvement was primarily driven by: •an $80 million non-cash increase in the value of the Endurance stock warrants •equity earnings from the Endurance common stock investment of $46 million compared to $21 million in 2002 •lower impairment writedowns of certain fixed-maturity and equity investments of $36 million in 2003 versus $130 million in 2002 (including $51 million cumulative effect of the change in policy relating to prior periods). These positive comparisons were somewhat offset by $48 million of interest on a tax settlement in 2002 with no comparable amount in 2003. Loss Before Income Tax Corporate and Other expenses were $148 million, an improvement of $73 million from the comparable period in 2002. This improvement is the result of: •a decline in interest expense of $23 million primarily from the paydown of both long-term and short-term debt. As a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003, we increased our notes payable balance by $726 million for subordinated debt owed to Aon Capital A, which was deconsolidated effective December 31, 2003. There was no effect on net income in 2003 as a result of this deconsolidation. However, beginning in 2004, the interest on this subordinated debt, previously reflected as Minority interest, net of tax on the consolidated statements of income will be shown as interest expense. (See notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.) •a decline in general expenses of $36 million due in part to $17 million of 2002 overhead costs for the previous planned divestiture of the underwriting businesses with no corresponding 2003 amount 48 •a net $14 million credit related to the World Trade Center. To allow us to resume business operations and minimize the loss caused by the disaster, we secured temporary office space in Manhattan. Later, we leased permanent space, and during first quarter 2003, we assigned this temporary space to another company. The costs related to this assignment were $46 million pretax. In fourth quarter 2003, we reached a final settlement of approximately $200 million for our overall World Trade Center property insurance claim. We received a cash payment of approximately $92 million during the fourth quarter, in addition to the $108 million we had already collected. As a result, we recognized a $60 million pretax gain on this settlement. These revenue and expense comparisons contributed to the overall Corporate and Other pretax loss of $23 million in 2003 versus a loss of $242 million in 2002. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Liquidity Our routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock. Our primary source for meeting these requirements is from dividends and internal financing from our operating subsidiaries. After meeting our routine dividend and debt servicing requirements, we used a portion of the remaining funding we received throughout the year for capital expenditures, made an early $100 million U.S. pension plan contribution and invested in acquisitions. Our major U.S. insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus at year-end 2003 exceeded the risk-based capital target set by the NAIC by a satisfactory level. In 2003, in order to enhance their financial position, we did not dividend any of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries' earnings to Aon parent company. During the past year, the statutory capital and surplus of the total underwriting companies has improved substantially. We anticipate that dividend payments to Aon parent company will resume in 2004 from CICA, our major insurance subsidiary. (Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements discusses regulatory restrictions relating to dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries.) In the aggregate, our operating subsidiaries anticipate that there will be adequate liquidity to meet their needs in the foreseeable future and to provide funds to the parent company. We have used cash flow primarily for debt reduction, dividend payments, business reinvestment, and acquisition financing. We expect our subsidiaries' positive cash flow to continue, and with it, our ability to access adequate short-term lines of credit. Cash on our statements of financial position includes funds available for general corporate purposes and funds we are holding on behalf of clients and to satisfy policyholder liabilities. In 2003, total cash contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans were $217 million, an increase of $141 million over 2002. This exceeded the original expectation due to an early contribution of $100 million to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in fourth quarter 2003. No corresponding early contributions were made in 2002. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate that 2004 contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans will be approximately $195 million. However, legislation being considered by the U.S. Congress will relieve some of these requirements, if passed. If so, we expect our 2004 contributions to our major defined benefit plans will be approximately $170 million. In connection with one of our U.K. pension plans, our principal U.K. subsidiary has agreed with the trustees of the plan to contribute £20 million per year to the plan for six years with the amount payable increasing by 5.3% on each January 1, commencing in 2005. These contributions are in addition to the normal employer contributions to the plan. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding up 49 deficit. In practice, the trustees have accepted the agreed schedule of contributions and have not requested such an advance. As of December 31, 2002, the estimated winding up deficit was £340 million. The winding up deficit has not yet been determined as of December 31, 2003. At the last valuation date, September 30, 2003, the estimated deficit between the value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, calculated under U.S. GAAP, was £134 million, of which £125 million was recorded as a minimum pension liability. In 1999, all U.K. pension plans were closed to new entrants. Cash Flows Cash flows from operations represent the net income we earned in the reported periods adjusted for non-cash revenue and charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities for 2003 were $1.3 billion, however, not all of these funds were available for use by us. The operating cash flow from our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $360 million was not available for general corporate purposes in 2003. To enhance their financial position, we decided not to dividend in 2003 any of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries' earnings to the Aon parent company. Also included in the $360 million was a $305 million change in operating assets and liabilities of the underwriting segment, net of reinsurance, primarily from unearned premiums and other fees. These funds will be used to satisfy future benefits to policyholders with the remainder being available, after taxes and other income and expense, to dividend to Aon parent company in future years. In our risk and insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, we collect cash payments from clients that include both premiums (payable to insurance companies for policies they issue) and commissions and fees (payable to us for our brokerage and consulting services). We record the commissions and fees as income and we hold clients' premiums for a short time before remitting them to insurers. The net increase in funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $200 million in 2003. The net balance for these funds is reflected in ""Other receivables and liabilities — net"" in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Proceeds of $48 million from the sale of operations included $30 million from the divestiture of Sheffield, which was sold for approximately book value. In 2003, available cash flows from operations were used primarily to: •pay down debt of $385 million •pay cash dividends of $190 million •provide for capital expenditures of $185 million •fund acquisitions of $56 million. Included in cash flows from operations are cash contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans of $217 million versus expense of $187 million. 50 Financial Condition Since year-end 2002, total assets increased $1.7 billion to $27 billion. In 2003, total investments increased $738 million to $7.3 billion from December 31, 2002. Fixed maturities increased $662 million, primarily relating to an asset management program at our insurance underwriting subsidiaries that became effective in second quarter 2003, which resulted in a shift from short-term to long-term investments. As a consequence of this decision, short-term investments in the insurance underwriting businesses decreased, but were offset by changes in foreign exchange rates, along with an increase in funds held on behalf of clients, resulting in an overall decline of $20 million. Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting receivables increased $177 million in 2003. Corresponding insurance premiums payable increased $464 million over the same period. These increases reflect: •the effect of foreign exchange rates •the timing of receipts and payments •the continued rise in premium rates across most lines of business •escalating client demand for risk programs •Aon's overall new account growth. Other assets increased $90 million from December 31, 2002. Other assets are comprised principally of prepaid premiums related to reinsurance, prepaid pension assets, and in 2002, assets of discontinued operations related to our automotive finance servicing business. Policy liabilities in total, excluding other policyholder funds, increased $703 million, which were principally offset by corresponding increases in reinsurance receivables (reflected in other receivables) and prepaid premiums related to reinsurance. Other policyholder funds decreased $81 million from 2002 due primarily to interest sensitive and deposit-type contracts maturing and our decision to stop offering these programs. Our minimum defined benefit pension liability, included in other liabilities, increased $262 million since last year-end. We are required to maintain at plan level, at a minimum, a liability equal to the difference between the present value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations. Investments We invest in broad asset categories related to our diversified operations. In managing our investments, our objective is to maximize earnings while monitoring asset and liability durations, interest and credit risks and regulatory requirements. We maintain well-capitalized operating companies. The financial strength of these companies permits a diversified investment portfolio including invested cash, fixed-income obligations, public and private equities and limited partnerships. The Corporate and Other segment contains invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, together with the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the underwriting business and related income. These insurance assets, which are publicly traded equities, as well as less liquid private equities and limited partnerships, represent a more aggressive investment strategy that gives us an opportunity for greater returns with longer-term investments. These assets, owned by the insurance underwriting companies: •are necessary to support strong claims paying ratings by independent rating agencies 51 •are unavailable for other uses such as debt reduction or share repurchases without considering regulatory requirements. (See note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.) In December 2001, we securitized $450 million of our LP investments and associated LP commitments, which represented most of our limited partnership investments, via a sale of PEPS I. The securitization: •gives our underwriting subsidiaries greater liquidity •has lessened the revenue variability in the Corporate and Other segment. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments. Borrowings Total debt at December 31, 2003 was $2.1 billion, up $360 million from December 31, 2002. Specifically: •Notes payable increased by $424 million compared to year-end 2002. This increase: —is primarily due to deconsolidating our mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities as a result of FIN 46 (see notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion), which resulted in increasing our notes payable balance by $726 million —was partially offset by retiring $300 million of outstanding debt securities due in January and June 2003. •Short-term debt declined $64 million, primarily due to a decrease in foreign short-term debt. In January 2004, we also retired the balance of our 6.3% debt securities ($89 million), which had become due. Contractual maturities of notes payable and operating lease commitments (with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year) are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2002, we completed an offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% convertible senior debentures due 2012. The debentures are unsecured obligations and are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately $21.475 per common share under certain circumstances including the following: •During any fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price (i.e. $25.77) for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter. Or •Subject to certain exceptions, during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures for each day of the ten trading day period was less than 95% of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of the debentures. Aon has reserved approximately 14 million shares for the potential conversion of these debentures. We received approximately $223 million by privately placing $225 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior notes due 2012 in fourth quarter 2002. In May 2003, we completed an offer to exchange these notes for notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 that have identical terms. 52 In 2002, we renegotiated our back-up lines of credit. Anticipating the spin-off of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries, we reduced our line of credit to $875 million. As a result of our capital enhancement actions, we renegotiated our short-term back-up lines of credit, reducing the total amount to $775 million in February 2003. The agreement expires in 2005. In fourth quarter 2002, the credit rating agencies lowered the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper. On October 31, 2002, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating of our senior debt to the current rating of ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1."" Moody's also placed the rating of our senior debt and the ""P-2"" rating of our commercial paper under review for possible future downgrade, which it subsequently removed without change. Also on October 31, 2002, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services placed its ""A-"" rating of our senior debt on CreditWatch with negative implications, which it subsequently removed without change. On August 31, 2003, Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on our senior debt from stable to negative. A further downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility. Any such further downgrade may trigger a further obligation of our company to fund an aggregate of up to $75 million with respect to our premium finance securitizations. Moreover, some of our debt instruments, such as our 6.20% notes due January 2007 ($250 million of which are outstanding), expressly provide for interest rate increases in the case of certain ratings downgrades. Similarly, any such downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether. If we cannot access the commercial paper market, although we have committed backup lines in excess of our current outstanding commercial paper borrowings, we cannot assure you that it would not adversely affect our financial position. A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt may also adversely affect the claims-paying ability or financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries. The major rating agencies' ratings of our debt securities at December 31, 2003 appear in the table below. Standard and Poor's outlook on Aon is negative. Ratings from Moody's Investor Services and Fitch, Inc. are on stable outlook. Standard And Poor's Moody's Investor Services Fitch, Inc. Senior long-term debt A- Baa2 A- Commercial paper A-2 P-2 F-2 Aon's principal insurance underwriting subsidiaries are rated ""A"", with a stable outlook by A.M. Best for their claims paying ability. Stockholders' Equity Stockholders' equity increased $603 million during 2003 to $4.5 billion, primarily reflecting: •$628 million of net income before preferred dividends •a $231 million (after tax) foreign exchange benefit These equity increases were partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders of $190 million. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $93 million since December 31, 2002. Net foreign exchange losses improved by $231 million because of the weakening U.S. dollar against foreign currencies as compared to the prior year-end. Net derivative gains increased $28 million over year-end 2002. Net unrealized investment gains rose $20 million during 2003. During 2003, some of our defined benefit pension plans, particularly in the U.K., incurred losses due to reduced discount rates. Accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. require a company to maintain, at a minimum, a liability on its balance sheet equal to the difference between the present 53 value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations. At year-end 2003, this increased pension obligation caused a $186 million (after-tax) reduction to stockholder's equity. We maintain the related pension plan assets in separate trust accounts; they are not part of our consolidated financial statements. This non-cash adjustment did not affect 2003 earnings. For 2004, we project: •our pension expense for our major defined benefit plans to be approximately $225 million. This expense was significantly affected by a lower discount rate. •cash contributions to the major defined benefit pension plans will be approximately $195 million. At December 31, 2003, stockholders' equity per share was $14.32, up from $12.56 at December 31, 2002, due principally to net income for 2003. Our total debt and preferred securities as a percentage of total capital is 33% at December 31, 2003, compared to 40% at year-end 2002. 54 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Aon and its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $90 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. We accrue amounts in our consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable. We use special purpose entities and qualifying special purpose entities (QSPE), also known as special purpose vehicles, in some of our operations, following the guidance of FASB Statement No. 140 and other relevant accounting guidance. Premium Financing Some of our special purpose vehicles were formed solely to purchase financing receivables and sell those balances to conduits owned and managed by third-party financial institutions. Subject to certain limitations, agreements allow us to sell to these conduit vehicles through December 2005. As of December 31, 2003, the maximum commitment contained in these agreements was $1.9 billion. Under the agreements, we sell the receivables to the conduits. Consequently, the conduits bear the credit risks on the receivables, subject to limited recourse in the form of credit loss reserves provided by our subsidiaries and which we guarantee. Under the guarantee provisions, our maximum cash requirement was approximately $75 million at December 31, 2003. The U.S. facility was renewed in July 2003 and the European facility was renewed in October 2003. The U.S. facility was increased by $100 million, and for both facilities, Aon's percentage guarantee was reduced, replaced by a collateral enhancement. We intend to renew these conduit facilities when they expire. If there are adverse bank, regulatory, tax or accounting rule changes, our access to the conduit facilities and special purpose vehicles would be restricted. These special purpose vehicles are not included in our consolidated financial statements. PEPS I On December 31, 2001, we sold the vast majority of our LP portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company, owned by one of our subsidiaries (49%) and by a charitable trust, which we do not control, established for victims of the September 11th attacks (51%). PEPS sold approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities to unaffiliated third parties. It then paid our insurance underwriting subsidiaries the $171 million in cash and issued them an additional $279 million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services rated the fixed-maturity securities our subsidiaries received from PEPS I as investment grade. As part of this transaction, the insurance companies must purchase from PEPS I additional fixed-maturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded LP commitments as they are requested. Approximately $20 million of these commitments were funded in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the unfunded commitments amounted to $80 million. These commitments have specific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments. Based on the rating agencies' downgrades of Aon's credit ratings in October 2002 on Aon's senior debt, credit support agreements were purchased in January 2003 whereby $100 million of cash of one of our underwriting subsidiaries has been pledged as collateral for these commitments. This collateral has been reduced to $77 million at December 31, 2003. 55 If the insurance companies fail to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities as commitments are drawn down, we have guaranteed their purchase. Subsequent to closing the securitization, one of the insurance subsidiaries sold PEPS I fixed-maturity securities with a value of $20 million to Aon. The assets and liabilities and operations of PEPS I are not included in our consolidated financial statements. Aon has recognized other-than-temporary impairment writedowns equal to the original cost of one tranche, including $32 million in 2002 and $27 million in first quarter 2003. The preferred stock interest represents a beneficial interest in the securitized limited partnership investments. The fair value of the private preferred stock interests depends on the value of the limited partnership investments held by PEPS I. Management assesses other-than-temporary declines in the fair value below cost using a financial model that considers: •the value of the underlying limited partnership investments of PEPS I •the nature and timing of the cash flows from the underlying limited partnership investments of PEPS I. Combined Global Funding In 1998, CICA, an Aon subsidiary, formed Combined Global Funding, LLC, a Cayman Islands-based special purpose entity (SPE), to issue notes to investors under a European Medium-Term Note Program (EMTN). The proceeds of the notes were used to purchase funding agreement policies issued by CICA. The contract terms of the funding agreement mirror the terms of the trust medium-term notes. Historically, the SPE has been consolidated by CICA based on the guidance in ARB 51 and EITF Topic D-14, with the EMTNs being classified as a policyholder liability in Aon's consolidated financial statements rather than notes payable, given that the liquidation preference of the underlying debt more closely resembled the characteristics of a policyholder liability. The interest expense on the EMTNs has been included in benefits to policyholders in the consolidated statements of income. The amounts of EMTNs outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $50 million and $79 million, respectively. In 2005, the remaining outstanding EMTN and the corresponding funding agreement are scheduled to be redeemed. Upon the adoption of FIN 46, Aon has determined that the SPE is a VIE and CICA is not the primary beneficiary, because CICA does not have a variable interest in the SPE. As a result, CICA was required to deconsolidate the trust on December 31, 2003. There was no effect on the consolidated statements of financial position or income statements as a result of this deconsolidation, as the funding agreement liability between CICA and the SPE is now classified as a policyholder liability. Contractual Obligations The following table: •summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 and the future periods during which we expect to settle these obligations in cash. •reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings. 56 Additional details about these obligations are provided in our footnotes to the financial statements as noted below. Payments due by period (in millions) Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 Years More than 5 years Total Long-Term Debt (note 8) $ 318 $ 260 $ 262 $ 1,255 $ 2,095 Interest expense on Long-Term Debt 134 216 175 1,176 1,701 Operating Leases (note 8) 354 586 408 877 2,225 Redeemable Preferred Stock (note 11) (1) — — — 50 50 Other Policyholder Funds — 58 — — 58 Purchase Obligations 128 60 9 1 198 Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP 7 11 2 5 25 Total $ 941 $ 1,191 $ 856 $ 3,364 $ 6,352 (1)Shares are redeemable at the option of Aon or the holders beginning one year after the occurrence of a certain future event. We also have obligations with respect to our pension and other benefit plans. (See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements as well as our discussion on liquidity, above.) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. Aon does not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading purposes. The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies used to manage these risks. A discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives is included in notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements. We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Our primary exposures are to the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar. We use over-the-counter (OTC) options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign operations. Additionally, some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiary earns approximately 60% of its revenue in U.S. dollars but the majority of its expenses are incurred in pounds sterling. Our policy is to convert into pounds sterling sufficient U.S. dollar revenue to fund the subsidiary's pound sterling expenses using over-the-counter (OTC) options and forward exchange contracts. At December 31, 2003, we have hedged 80% of the U.K. subsidiaries' expected U.S. dollar transaction exposure for the next twelve months. We do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years. The impact to 2003 and 2002 pretax income in the event of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the respective quoted year-end exchange rates would not be material after consideration of derivative positions. The nature of the income of our businesses is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates and, as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel 57 decrease in the period end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $9 million and $14 million to 2003 and 2002 pretax income, respectively. The valuation of our fixed-maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 1% increase in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of the portfolio at December 31, 2003 and 2002 by approximately $90 million and $85 million, respectively. We have notes payable and preferred securities outstanding with a fair value of $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This fair value was greater than the carrying value by $234 million and $36 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A hypothetical 1% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value by approximately 7% and 6% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The valuation of our marketable equity security portfolio is subject to equity price risk. If market prices were to decrease by 10%, the fair value of the equity portfolio would have a corresponding decrease of $4 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $6 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no outstanding derivatives hedging the price risk on the equity portfolio. We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity market prices in order to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events. We believe that these changes in rates and prices are reasonably possible over a one-year period. 58 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors Board of Directors and Stockholders Aon Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Aon Corporation as December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Aon Corporation at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 1, as of December 31, 2003, the Company changed its method of accounting for its involvement with certain variable interest entities and in 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill. Chicago, Illinois February 10, 2004 59 Report By Management Management of Aon Corporation is responsible for the fairness of presentation and integrity of the financial statements and other financial information in the annual report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These statements include informed estimates and judgments for those transactions not yet complete or for which the ultimate effects cannot be measured precisely. Financial information elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been audited by our independent auditors. Their role is to render an independent professional opinion on Aon's financial statements. Management maintains a system of internal control designed to meet its responsibilities for reliable financial statements. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate costs, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's authorization. Judgments are required to assess and balance the relative costs and expected benefits of those controls. It is management's opinion that its system of internal control as of December 31, 2003 was effective in providing reasonable assurance that its financial statements were free of material misstatement. In addition, management supports and maintains a professional staff of internal auditors who coordinate audit coverage with the independent auditors and conduct a program of financial and operational audits. The Board of Directors selects an Audit Committee from among its members. All members of the Audit Committee are independent of the Company. The Audit Committee recommends to the Board of Directors appointment of the independent auditors and provides oversight relating to the review of financial information provided to stockholders and others, the systems of internal control which management and the Board of Directors have established and the audit process. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management, internal auditors and independent auditors to review the work of each and to satisfy itself that those parties are properly discharging their responsibilities. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee, without the presence of management, to discuss the adequacy of internal control and to review the quality of financial reporting. 60 Consolidated Statements of Income (millions except per share data) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 REVENUE Brokerage commissions and fees $ 6,884 $ 6,187 $ 5,411 Premiums and other 2,609 2,368 2,027 Investment income (note 7) 317 252 213 Total revenue 9,810 8,807 7,651 EXPENSES General expenses (notes 4, 5 and 15) 7,123 6,459 5,729 Benefits to policyholders 1,427 1,375 1,111 Interest expense 101 124 127 Amortization of intangible assets 63 54 158 Unusual charges (credits) — World Trade Center (note 1) (14 ) (29 ) 158 Total expenses 8,700 7,983 7,283 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX AND MINORITY INTEREST 1,110 824 368 Provision for income tax (note 9) 411 304 145 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE MINORITY INTEREST 699 520 223 Minority interest, net of tax — Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (note 11) (36 ) (34 ) (40 ) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 663 486 183 LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX (note 1) (35 ) (20 ) (36 ) NET INCOME $ 628 $ 466 $ 147 NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS $ 625 $ 463 $ 144 BASIC NET INCOME PER SHARE: Income from continuing operations $ 2.08 $ 1.72 $ 0.67 Discontinued operations (0.11 ) (0.07 ) (0.13 ) Net income $ 1.97 $ 1.65 $ 0.54 DILUTIVE NET INCOME PER SHARE: Income from continuing operations $ 2.08 $ 1.71 $ 0.66 Discontinued operations (0.11 ) (0.07 ) (0.13 ) Net income $ 1.97 $ 1.64 $ 0.53 CASH DIVIDENDS PER SHARE PAID ON COMMON STOCK $ 0.60 $ 0.825 $ 0.895 DILUTIVE AVERAGE COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING 317.8 282.6 272.4 See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 61 Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (millions) As of December 31 2003 2002 ASSETS INVESTMENTS Fixed maturities at fair value $ 2,751 $ 2,089 Equity securities at fair value 42 62 Short-term investments 3,815 3,835 Other investments 716 600 Total investments 7,324 6,586 CASH 540 484 RECEIVABLES Insurance brokerage and consulting services 8,607 8,430 Other receivables 1,504 1,129 Total receivables (net of allowance for doubtful accounts: 2003 — $187;

Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aon Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (Aon), except for the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2003, which includes the accounts of Aon Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (excluding special-purpose entities (""VIEs"") considered variable interest entities for which Aon is not the primary beneficiary). These statements include informed estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ from the amounts reported. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Segment Reporting Aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services (previously called Insurance Brokerage and Other Services), Consulting and Insurance Underwriting. A fourth segment, Corporate and Other, when aggregated with the operating segments, and after the elimination of intersegment revenues, totals to the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. In 2003, certain business units were reclassified among segments. Certain administration and marketing services relating to the insurance underwriting operations, previously included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, were reclassified into the Insurance Underwriting segment. The automotive finance servicing business, previously included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, was sold in fourth quarter 2003. Activity attributable to this business has been reflected as a discontinued operation. Certain amounts in prior years' consolidated financial statements relating to segments and discontinued operations have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation. Brokerage Commissions and Fees Commission income is recognized at the later of the billing or effective date of the policy. However, in circumstances where a binding order has been received before the end of the accounting period and coverage is effective, but processing has not yet occurred in the billing system due to timing, an accrual is recorded. Aon's policy for estimating allowances for return commissions on policy cancellations is to record an allowance based on a historical evaluation of cancellations as a percentage of related revenue. Certain life insurance commissions, commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance companies and certain other carrier compensation are generally recognized as income when received. Revenues may be recorded in advance of the cash receipts in cases where the amounts due to be received have been confirmed by the insurance company, or when Aon has sufficient information in its records to estimate amounts for premium based revenue accruals in accordance with agreements Aon has with insurance carriers. Commissions on premium adjustments are recognized as they occur. Fees for claims services, benefit consulting, human capital outsourcing, reinsurance services and other services are recognized when the services are rendered. Aon has entered into multiple year outsourcing arrangements with clients. Revenues received from these agreements are recorded on a gross basis, inclusive of amounts ultimately passed through to subcontractors, when Aon maintains the performance obligation, and are recorded ratably over the life of the contract. 66 The portion of the revenues received on extended warranty contracts that are for the marketing, administration and servicing of those contracts are reported as earned consistent with the method used to earn the premium portion of those revenues, and revenues that represent administrative fee-for-service arrangements, for which Aon does not bear the underwriting risk, are earned as those services are performed. These fee-for-service arrangements include the marketing and servicing of extended warranty contracts on behalf of other companies and brokerage commissions for accident and health products placed with non-Aon insurance carriers. These revenues are reported in the Insurance Underwriting segment. Premium Revenue For accident and health products, premiums are reported as earned in proportion to insurance protection provided over the period covered by the policies. For life products, premiums are recognized as revenue when due. For extended warranty products, premium revenues represent the portion of revenue from these contracts that are submitted to an Aon insurance carrier for coverage and are earned over the period of risk in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided in accordance with FASB Statement No. 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises. For investment products, generally there is no requirement for payment of premium other than to maintain account values at a level sufficient to pay mortality and expense charges. Consequently, premiums for investment products are not reported as revenue, but as deposits. Policy fee revenue for investment products consists of charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration and surrenders assessed during the period. Expenses include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit claims incurred in excess of policy account balances. Reinsurance Reinsurance premiums, commissions and expense reimbursements on reinsured business are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Premiums and benefits to policyholders ceded to other companies have been reported as a reduction of premium revenue and benefits to policyholders. Expense reimbursements received in connection with reinsurance ceded have been accounted for as a reduction of the related policy acquisition costs. Reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premium amounts are reported as assets. Unusual Charges (Credits) — World Trade Center In 2001, Aon recorded pretax unusual charges of $158 million ($97 million after-tax or $0.35 per dilutive share), net of insurance and reinsurance recoveries, related to losses sustained as a result of the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and the death of 175 employees. Costs incurred included $33 million of destroyed depreciable assets at net book value, $40 million for salaries and benefits for deceased and injured employees and other costs, and a $10 million commitment to the Aon Memorial Education fund to support the educational needs of the children of Aon employees who were victims of the September 11th attacks. Offsetting these expenses were estimated insurance recoveries of $60 million as of fourth quarter 2001. These costs also included $192 million of insurance benefits paid by Aon's Combined Insurance Company of America subsidiary (CICA) under life insurance policies issued for the benefit of deceased employees, which were partially offset by reinsurance recoveries of $147 million, resulting in a net charge of $45 million. Reinsurers have disputed their liability as to approximately $90 million of reinsurance recoveries under a Business Travel Accident (BTA) policy issued by CICA to cover U.S.-based employees of subsidiaries of Aon, and legal actions were filed by both parties. In fourth quarter 2001, Aon recorded a pretax $90 million allowance for a potentially uncollectible receivable related to this dispute. In September 2002, CICA's New York action with respect to the BTA policy was dismissed by the trial court for lack of subject 67 matter jurisdiction, and in August 2003 the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal. CICA immediately filed its action in Chicago, Illinois, but this action was dismissed in January 2004. Litigation in the U.K. continues. During November 2002, a partial settlement was reached with Aon's property insurance carriers pertaining to reimbursement for depreciable assets destroyed. This settlement resulted in a pretax credit of $29 million, which is reported as an Unusual Credit — World Trade Center in the 2002 consolidated statements of income. In order to resume business operations and minimize the loss caused by the World Trade Center disaster, Aon secured temporary office space in Manhattan. Subsequently, permanent space was leased and, during first quarter 2003, Aon assigned this temporary space to another company. The costs relating to this assignment were $46 million pretax in 2003. In fourth quarter 2003, Aon reached a final settlement of approximately $200 million for its overall World Trade Center property insurance claim. A cash payment of approximately $92 million was received during fourth quarter 2003, in addition to the $108 million already collected in prior years. This settlement resulted in a pretax gain of $60 million. This gain, and the $46 million expense discussed above, are combined and reported as a $14 million Unusual credit — World Trade Center in the 2003 consolidated statement of income. Automotive Finance Servicing Business In third quarter 2003, Aon decided to sell its automobile finance servicing business, which had been in run-off since first quarter 2001 (see note 5). The sale was completed in fourth quarter 2003 for proceeds of approximately $18 million. Operating results from prior periods attributable to this unit have been reclassified as discontinued operations. Revenues of this business were $13 million, $15 million and $25 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The revenues and expenses were reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and were net of tax benefits of $20 million, $11 million and $23 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Included in the loss from discontinued operations in 2003 is a pretax loss from operations of $32 million and a loss from the revaluation of the business of $23 million. Assets and liabilities of this business, reflected in other assets and other liabilities in the 2002 consolidated statements of financial position, were $107 million and $38 million, respectively. Income Tax Deferred income tax has been provided for the effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and has been measured using the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that are currently in effect. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Income Per Share Basic income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, excluding any dilutive effects of stock options and awards. Net income available for common stockholders is net of all preferred dividends. Dilutive income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and awards. The dilutive effect of stock options and awards is calculated under the treasury stock method using the average market price for the period. Certain common stock equivalents related to options were not included in the computation of diluted income per share because those options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares. The number of options excluded from the calculation were 24 million in 2003 and 2002 and 4 million in 2001. Aon's 3.5% convertible debt securities may be converted into a maximum of 14 million shares of Aon common stock. These shares have not been included in the computation of diluted income per share because the 68 circumstances which would trigger the conversion have not yet occurred. (See note 8 for further information). Income per share is calculated as follows: (millions except per share data) 2003 2002 2001 Income from continuing operations $ 663 $ 486 $ 183 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (35 ) (20 ) (36 ) Net income 628 466 147 Redeemable preferred stock dividends (3 ) (3 ) (3 ) Net income for dilutive and basic $ 625 $ 463 $ 144 Basic shares outstanding 317 281 269 Common stock equivalents 1 2 3 Dilutive potential common shares 318 283 272 Basic net income per share: Income from continuing operations $ 2.08 $ 1.72 $ 0.67 Discontinued operations (0.11 ) (0.07 ) (0.13 ) Net income $ 1.97 $ 1.65 $ 0.54 Dilutive net income per share: Income from continuing operations $ 2.08 $ 1.71 $ 0.66 Discontinued operations (0.11 ) (0.07 ) (0.13 ) Net income $ 1.97 $ 1.64 $ 0.53 Stock Compensation Plans Aon applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock option plan as the exercise price of the options equaled the market price of the stock at the date of grant. Compensation expense has been recognized for stock awards based on the market price at the date of the award. 69 The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if Aon had applied the fair value recognition provision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation. (millions, except per share data) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Net income, as reported $ 628 $ 466 $ 147 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 31 14 19 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 55 37 29 Proforma net income $ 604 $ 443 $ 137 Net income per share: Basic As reported $ 1.97 $ 1.65 $ 0.54 Pro forma 1.89 1.57 0.51 Dilutive As reported 1.97 1.64 0.53 Pro forma 1.89 1.56 0.50 The fair value per share of options and awards granted is estimated as $3.59 and $18.33 in 2003, $6.21 and $28.54 in 2002, and $8.66 and $29.78 in 2001, respectively, on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2003 2002 2001 Dividend yield 2.3 % 2.25 % 2.0 % Expected volatility 23.4 % 21.1 % 27.8 % Risk-free interest rate 2.9 % 4.3 % 6.0 % Expected term life beyond vesting date (in years): Stock options 1.0 0.96 1.06 Stock awards — — — The compensation cost as generated by the Black-Scholes model may not be indicative of the future benefit, if any, that may be received by the option holder. The pro forma information reflected above may not be representative of the amounts to be expected in future years as the fair value method of accounting contained in FASB Statement No. 123 has not been applied to options and awards granted prior to January 1995. Investments Short-term investments include certificates of deposit and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with maturities of up to one year (generally three months or less) and money market funds and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Fixed-maturity securities are available for sale and are carried at fair value. The amortized cost of fixed maturities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts to maturity that are included in investment income. Marketable equity securities that are held directly are carried at fair value. Mortgage loans and policy loans are generally carried at cost or unpaid principal balance. 70 Private equity investments are generally carried at cost, which approximates fair value, except where Aon has significant influence, in which case they are carried under the equity method. Unrealized gains and temporary unrealized losses on fixed maturities and directly-held equity securities are excluded from income and are recorded directly to stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred income taxes. Endurance common stock and warrants — In December 2001, Aon's underwriting subsidiaries invested $227 million in Endurance Specialty Holdings, Ltd. (Endurance), formerly known as Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd., a Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance company formed to provide additional underwriting capacity to commercial property and casualty insurance and reinsurance clients. The investment in Endurance is carried under the equity method, and is included in Other Receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position. As of December 31, 2003, the carrying value of Aon's common stock investment in Endurance was $298 million, representing approximately 11.3 million shares. In conjunction with this common stock investment, Aon's underwriting subsidiaries also received approximately 4 million stock purchase warrants which allow Aon to purchase additional Endurance common stock through December 2011. These warrants meet the definition of a derivative as described in Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires them to be recorded in the financial statements at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings on a current basis. Through December 31, 2002, these warrants had been carried at zero value, which approximated their original cost. In first quarter 2003, Endurance completed its initial public offering, which provided a market value for the underlying shares and removed much of the uncertainty regarding the fair value of Endurance and the warrants. With the assistance of an independent third party, Aon has valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes pricing model and has determined that the warrants had a fair value of approximately $80 million as of December 31, 2003. The valuation assumptions used in the model at December 31, 2003 were as follows: • Maturity (in years) 7.96 • Spot Price $ 30.50 • Risk Free Interest Rate 4.50 % • Dividend Yield 0.00 % • Volatility 24 % • Exercise Price $ 15.96 The model assumes: the warrants are ""European-style,"" which means that they are valued as if the exercise can only occur on the expiration date; the spot and exercise prices are reduced by expected future dividends; and the dividend remains unchanged during the period the warrants are outstanding. Although Endurance currently pays a dividend, a zero dividend yield as used in the Endurance warrants valuation since the value of future dividend payments have been reflected in the spot and exercise price used in the valuation. The $80 million (pretax) increase in value during 2003 was recognized as investment income in the Corporate and Other segment. The future value of the warrants may vary considerably from the value at December 31, 2003 due to the price movement of the underlying shares, as well as the passage of time and changes in other factors that are employed in the valuation model. Limited partnership investments are carried under the equity method. Certain of the limited partnerships in which Aon invests have holdings in publicly-traded equities. Changes in market value of these indirectly-held equities flow through the limited partnerships' financial statements. Aon's ownership share of these valuation changes is included in Aon's Corporate and Other segment revenue. 71 PEPS I — In December 2001, Aon securitized $450 million of limited partnership investments, plus associated limited partnership commitments, via a sale to Private Equity Partnership Structures I, LLC (PEPS I). Aon received $171 million in cash plus $279 million of newly-issued fixed maturity and preferred stock securities of PEPS I. The underlying equity in the limited partnerships was the basis for determining the fair value of the cash and securities received in the securitization. No significant management assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the cash and securities received in the securitization or the value at December 31, 2003 or 2002. At December 31, 2003, a 10% or 20% decrease in the underlying equity of the limited partnerships would have resulted in a decrease in the value of the preferred stock securities owned by $37 million and $75 million, respectively. General — Income or loss on disposal of any securities held is computed using the specific costs of the securities sold and is reported as investment income in the consolidated statements of income. Declines in the fair value of invested assets below cost are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment losses on a quarterly basis. Impairment losses for declines in value of fixed-maturity investments and equity securities below cost attributable to issuer-specific events are based upon all relevant facts and circumstances for each investment and are recognized when appropriate in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and related guidance. For fixed-maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events where Aon has the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity, declines in value below cost are assumed to be temporary. Aon's policy for equity securities is to recognize impairment losses on specific securities that have had continuous material unrealized losses for more than three consecutive quarters, or less due to market conditions or industry-related events. Reserves for certain other investments are established based on an evaluation of the respective investment portfolio and current economic conditions. Write-downs and changes in reserves are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. In general, Aon ceases to accrue investment income when interest or dividend payments are in arrears. Accounting policies relating to derivative financial instruments are discussed in note 14. Cash Cash includes time deposits. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Aon's policy for estimating allowances for doubtful accounts with respect to receivables is to record an allowance based on a historical evaluation of write-offs, aging of balances, and other qualitative and quantitative analyses. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Costs of acquiring new and renewal insurance underwriting business, principally the excess of new commissions over renewal commissions, underwriting and sales expenses that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of new business, are deferred and reported as assets. For long-duration life and health products, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is related to, and based on the expected premium revenues of the policies. In general, amortization is adjusted to reflect current withdrawal experience. Expected premium revenues are estimated by using the same assumptions used in estimating future policy benefits. For extended warranty and short-duration health insurance, costs of acquiring and renewing business are deferred and amortized as the related premiums and contract fees are earned. 72 Intangible Assets Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill relating to business acquisitions had been amortized into income over periods not exceeding 40 years using the straight-line method. Goodwill related to acquisitions made after June 30, 2001 has not been amortized. Beginning in January 2002, goodwill has not been amortized but instead has been tested for impairment annually. See Accounting and Disclosure Changes for further information. The cost of other intangible assets is being amortized over a range of 2 to 10 years with a weighted-average original life of 8.2 years. As required by Statement No. 142, Aon assesses the recoverability of its intangible assets through an analysis of expected future cash flows. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Included in this category is internal use software, which is software that is acquired, internally developed or modified solely to meet internal needs, with no plan to market externally. Costs related to directly obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software are capitalized. These costs are generally amortized using the straight-line method over a range of 1 to 8 years. The weighted-average original life of Aon's software at December 31, 2003 is 4.6 years. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair values for financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments: Carrying amounts approximate fair value. Fixed-maturity and equity securities: Fair value is based on quoted market prices or, if they are not actively traded, on estimated values obtained from independent pricing services. Derivative financial instruments: Fair value is based on quoted prices for exchange-traded instruments or the cost to terminate or offset with other contracts. Other investments are comprised of Aon's investment in Endurance common stock and warrants, mortgage loans, policy loans, private equity investments and limited partnerships. Endurance common stock: Aon's investment in Endurance common stock is accounted for on the equity method. Accordingly, its carrying value ($298 million at December 31, 2003) is determined by adjusting the initial cost of the investment with Aon's share of Endurance's net income and unrealized gains or losses since acquisition. Shares of Endurance common stock are publicly traded and quoted market prices are available. Based on the December 31, 2003 quoted market price of $33.55 per share (NYSE:ENH), Aon's investment in Endurance has a fair market value of $380 million. Aon carries Endurance on the equity method due to its influence on Endurance's board of directors and various board committees. Endurance warrants: Fair value is determined with the assistance of an independent third party using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Mortgage loans and policy loans: Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates currently being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Private equity investments and limited partnerships: Carrying amounts approximate fair value, as it is generally not practical to estimate fair value without incurring excessive costs. 73 Deposit-type contracts: Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. Notes payable: Fair value is based on quoted market prices for the publicly-traded portion and on estimates using discounted cash flow analyses based on current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements for the nonpublicly-traded portion. Future Policy Benefits, Policy and Contract Claims, Unearned Premiums and Contract Fees Future policy benefit liabilities on life, accident and health products have been provided on the net level premium method. The liabilities are calculated based on assumptions as to investment yield, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates that were determined at the date of issue and provide for possible adverse deviations. Interest assumptions are graded and range from 2% to 6% at December 31, 2003. Withdrawal assumptions are based principally on insurance subsidiaries' experience and vary by plan, year of issue and duration. Policy and contract claim liabilities represent estimates for reported claims, as well as provisions for losses incurred, but not yet reported. These claim liabilities are based on historical experience and are estimates of the ultimate amount to be paid when the claims are settled. The estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency. The process of estimating and establishing policy and contract liabilities is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known; such adjustments are included in current operations. Unearned premiums and contract fees generally are calculated using the pro rata method based on gross premiums. However, in the case of extended warranty and credit life and disability products, the unearned premiums and contract fees are calculated such that the premiums and contract fees are earned over the period of risk in a reasonable relationship to anticipated claims. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. Foreign assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Net foreign exchange gains and losses on translation are generally reported in stockholders' equity, in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred income tax. The effect of exchange rate changes on the consolidated statements of income, after consideration of derivative hedging, was approximately $0.13 per diluted and basic share in 2003. For 2002 and 2001 it was insignificant. Accounting and Disclosure Changes In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Statement No. 141 superceded Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations, and amended or superceded a number of interpretations of APB No. 16. Certain purchase accounting guidance in APB No. 16, as well as certain of its amendments and interpretations, have been carried forward. The statement eliminated the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations. It also changed the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill. The requirements of Statement No. 141 were effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that was completed after June 30, 2001. Statement No. 142 supercedes APB No. 17, Intangible Assets. Under Statement No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The amortization provisions of Statement No. 142 apply to goodwill and intangible 74 assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill acquired prior to July 1, 2001, amortization was discontinued effective as of January 1, 2002. Reported goodwill amortization was $118 million for the year ended December 2001. In accordance with Statement No. 141, other intangible assets which resulted from acquisitions made prior to July 1, 2001, that did not meet the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill (as defined by Statement No. 141) were to be classified as goodwill upon adoption of the statement. Accordingly, Aon reclassified $287 million of these intangibles, net of accumulated amortization, to goodwill as of January 1, 2002. In addition, Aon re-examined the useful lives of all intangibles in accordance with Statement No. 142. Reported amortization expense for all other intangibles was $63 million, $54 million and $40 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2001, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for ""Out-of-Pocket"" Expenses Incurred. This EITF required companies to reflect reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses incurred as revenue and the corresponding obligation as expense, in the consolidated statements of income. In 2002, Aon netted payments of reimbursable expenses against revenue due to the immaterial amount of out-of-pocket expenses incurred. Aon adopted the provisions of EITF No. 01-14 beginning in first quarter 2003. This change had no impact on pretax income, but increased both 2003 revenue and expense by $33 million. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Statement No. 146 supercedes EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). Statement No. 146 was effective January 1, 2003. This Statement did not have a material impact on Aon's consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). Guarantees meeting the characteristics described in FIN 45 are required to be initially recorded at fair value, which is different from the general current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, as those terms are defined in FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. FIN 45's disclosure requirements are applicable for each guarantee, or each group of similar guarantees, even if the likelihood of the guarantor having to make payments is remote. FIN 45's disclosure requirements were effective for financial statements ending after December 15, 2002. Aon's disclosures may be found in note 14. FIN 45's initial recognition and initial measurement provisions were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Implementation of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on Aon's consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure. Statement No. 148 amends Statement No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition to Statement No. 123's fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Statement No. 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of Statement No. 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity's accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. Aon adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 148 effective with its 2002 Annual Report. Aon is evaluating its position regarding its accounting for stock-based compensation based on recent FASB initiatives. 75 In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). In December 2003, the FASB modified FIN 46 to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen. FIN 46 provides a new framework for identifying VIEs and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements. In general, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited-liability corporation, trust, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities, or (3) has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. FIN 46 requires a VIE to be consolidated if a party with an ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (""a variable interest holder"") is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE's activities, is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns (if no party absorbs a majority of the VIE's losses), or both. A variable interest holder that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all of the VIE's assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the VIE as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about VIEs that the variable interest holder is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. FIN 46 was effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003. The provisions of FIN 46, as revised, were adopted as of December 31, 2003 for Aon's interests in VIEs that are special purpose entities (SPEs). Aon expects to adopt the provisions of FIN 46 for Aon's variable interests in all VIEs as of March 31, 2004, which is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In January 1997, Aon created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust, for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (Capital Securities). The sole asset of Aon Capital A is a $726 million aggregate principal amount of Aon's 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due January 1, 2027. The Capital Securities are categorized in the December 31, 2002 consolidated statement of financial position as ""Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding Solely Aon's Junior Subordinated Debentures."" (See Note 11). Aon has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and was required to deconsolidate the Trust based on the provisions of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003. As a result of the deconsolidation, Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding Solely Aon's Junior Subordinated Debentures decreased by $702 million, completely offset by an increase in notes payable and other receivables of $726 million and $24 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003. There was no effect on net income or consolidated stockholders' equity as a result of this deconsolidation. Prior periods were not restated. In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The intent of this Statement is more consistent reporting of contracts as either freestanding derivative instruments subject to Statement No. 133 in its entirety, or as hybrid instruments with debt host contracts and embedded derivative features. Statement No. 149 amends Statement No. 133 as a result of (1) decisions previously made as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) process, (2) changes made in connection with other FASB projects dealing with financial instruments, and (3) deliberations in connection with issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a derivative. 76 Statement No. 149 was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. Provisions of Statement No. 149 that represent the codification of previous DIG decisions are already effective. This Statement did not have a material impact on Aon's consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This Statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Statement No. 150 must be applied immediately to instruments entered into or modified after May 15, 2003 and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB indefinitely deferred the application of certain portions of Statement No. 150. The adoption of the provisions of Statement No. 150 that became effective in 2003 did not have a material impact on Aon's consolidated financial statements. The remaining provisions of Statement No. 150, when they become effective, are not expected to have a material impact on Aon's consolidated financial statements. Aon's $50 million redeemable preferred stock will be reclassed to liabilities after the occurrence of a certain future event. In December 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers' Disclosures about Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. This Statement revises employers' disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement of recognition provisions of FASB Statements No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, No. 88, Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, and No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. This Statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in the original FASB Statement No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, which it replaces. It requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The required information is to be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans. The provisions of the original Statement 132 remain in effect until the provisions of the revised Statement are adopted. Except as noted below, the revised Statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The interim-period disclosures required by the revised Statement are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. The additional disclosure of information about foreign plans required by the revised statement is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. In addition, disclosure of the benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five fiscal years, and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Aon adopted the disclosure requirements for its domestic plans effective with its 2003 Form 10-K. Aon will adopt the interim-period disclosures effective with its first quarter 2004 Form 10-Q, and the disclosures about its foreign plans will be included with its 2004 Form 10-K. Reclassification Certain amounts in prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation. 77 2. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, Aon's goodwill is no longer amortized. Goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to various reporting units, which are either its operating segments or one reporting level below the operating segment. In 2001 and prior years, goodwill amortization was systematically expensed in the Corporate and Other segment. Statement No. 142 requires Aon to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value at the valuation date, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the recorded amount of goodwill. Fair value is estimated based on various valuation metrics. In first quarter 2002, Aon completed its initial impairment review that indicated that there was no impairment as of January 1, 2002. In both the fourth quarter 2003 and 2002, Aon completed its annual impairment review that affirmed there was no impairment as of October 1 (the annual evaluation date). A reconciliation of net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 to adjusted net income had Statement No. 142 and the reclassification provisions of Statement No. 141 been applicable for all periods presented follows. Year Ended December 31, 2001 (millions, except per share data) Amount Basic Net Income Per Share Dilutive Net Income Per Share Reported net income $ 147 $ 0.54 $ 0.53 Add back amortization (net of tax): Goodwill 104 0.38 0.38 Intangible assets reclassified to goodwill 10 0.04 0.04 Less amortization (net of tax): Other intangible assets — change in amortization periods (5 ) (0.02 ) (0.02 ) $ 256 $ 0.94 $ 0.93 The changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are as follows: (millions) Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services Consulting Insurance Underwriting Total Balance as of December 31, 2002 $ 3,487 $ 372 $ 240 $ 4,099 Goodwill acquired during the period 60 1 — 61 Foreign currency revaluation 339 8 2 349 Balance as of December 31, 2003 $ 3,886 $ 381 $ 242 $ 4,509 Balance as of December 31, 2001 $ 3,239 $ 366 $ 237 $ 3,842 Goodwill acquired during the period 58 5 — 63 Foreign currency revaluation 190 1 3 194 Balance as of December 31, 2002 $ 3,487 $ 372 $ 240 $ 4,099 78 Intangible assets are classified into three categories: •""Customer Related and Contract Based"" include client lists as well as non-compete covenants; •""Present Value of Future Profits"" represents the future profits of purchased books of business of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries; and •""Marketing, Technology and Other"" are all other purchased intangibles not included in the preceding categories. Amortizable intangible assets by asset class follow: (millions) Customer Related and Contract Based Present Value of Future Profits Marketing, Technology and Other Total As of December 31, 2003 Gross carrying amount $ 223 $ 87 $ 166 $ 476 Accumulated amortization 163 50 87 300 Net carrying amount $ 60 $ 37 $ 79 $ 176 As of December 31, 2002 Gross carrying amount $ 225 $ 76 $ 162 $ 463 Accumulated amortization 148 24 66 238 Net carrying amount $ 77 $ 52 $ 96 $ 225 Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 is estimated to be $53 million, $46 million, $37 million, $14 million and $11 million, respectively. 79 3. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of other comprehensive income (loss) and the related tax effects are as follows: Year ended December 31, 2003 (millions) Amount Before Taxes Income Tax (Expense) Benefit Amount Net of Taxes Net derivative gains arising during the year $ 68 $ (27 ) $ 41 Reclassification adjustment (22 ) 9 (13 ) Net derivative gains 46 (18 ) 28 Unrealized holding gains arising during the year 31 (11 ) 20 Reclassification adjustment — — — Net unrealized investment gains 31 (11 ) 20 Net foreign exchange translation 379 (148 ) 231 Net additional minimum pension liability adjustment (225 ) 39 (186 ) Total other comprehensive income $ 231 $ (138 ) $ 93 In 2003, the pretax amount of $225 million for net additional minimum pension liability adjustment includes $(4) million related to the defined benefit pension plans in Canada.

Business Combinations Acquisitions In 2003, Aon completed several immaterial acquisitions, mostly related to the insurance brokerage operations. In these transactions, Aon paid an aggregate of approximately $56 million in cash and $8 million in common stock. Internal funds, short-term borrowings and common stock financed the acquisitions. Goodwill of approximately $45 million and other intangible assets of approximately $11 million, accounted for on a preliminary basis, resulted from these acquisitions. In 2002, Aon completed several immaterial acquisitions, mostly related to the insurance brokerage operations. In these transactions, Aon paid an aggregate of approximately $111 million in cash and $3 million in common stock. Internal funds, short-term borrowings and common stock financed the acquisitions. Goodwill of approximately $51 million and other intangible assets of approximately $48 million resulted from these acquisitions. In 2001, Aon acquired ASI Solutions Incorporated (ASI), a worldwide provider of human resource outsourcing and compensation consulting services, and First Extended, Inc. (FEI), an underwriter and administrator of automotive extended warranty products, and certain other insurance brokerage and consulting operations. In these transactions, Aon paid an aggregate of approximately $107 million in cash and $197 million in common stock. Internal funds, short-term borrowings and common stock financed the acquisitions. Goodwill of approximately $282 million and other intangible assets of approximately $72 million, resulted from these acquisitions. In July 2001, Aon acquired the common stock of two entities controlled by Aon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The acquisition was financed by the issuance of approximately 22.4 million shares of Aon common stock. The two acquired entities owned, in the aggregate, approximately 22.4 million shares of Aon common stock, which are included in treasury stock, and had additional net assets, net of expenses, totaling $5 million. This transaction did not have a material effect on Aon's total assets, liabilities or stockholders' equity. The results of operations of these acquisitions, all of which were accounted for by the purchase method, are included in the consolidated financial statements from the dates they were acquired. Pro forma results of these acquisitions are not materially different from reported results. Restructuring charges In 2003, Aon made payments of $10 million on restructuring charges and purchase accounting liabilities related to business combinations. In 1996 and 1997, Aon recorded pretax special charges for restructuring Aon's brokerage operations as a result of the acquisition of Alexander & Alexander Services, Inc. (A&A), as well as restructuring the A&A and Bain Hogg brokerage operations. As of December 31, 2003, all termination benefits have been paid. The remaining liability of $40 million is for lease abandonments and other exit costs, and is being paid out over several years as planned. 82 The following table sets forth the activity related to these liabilities: (millions) Balance at December 31, 2000 $ 78 Cash payments in 2001 (19 ) Foreign currency revaluation (1 ) Balance at December 31, 2001 58 Cash payments in 2002 (11 ) Foreign currency revaluation 4 Balance at December 31, 2002 51 Cash payments in 2003 (14 ) Foreign currency revaluation 3 Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 40 All of Aon's unpaid liabilities relating to acquisitions are reflected in general expense liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. 83 5. Business Transformation Plan In fourth quarter 2000, after final approval by its Board of Directors, Aon began a comprehensive business transformation plan designed to enhance client service, improve productivity through process redesign, and accelerate growth. Costs of the plan include special charges and transition costs. In connection with the overall plan and strategic initiatives, Aon recorded total net expenses of $294 million of which $6 million of income, $218 million of expenses and $82 million of expenses were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and are reflected in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. In 2000, expenses included costs related to termination benefits of $54 million, covering notification to 750 employees. Other costs to exit an activity of $6 million were incurred, which included $2 million for abandoned leases and $4 million for direct costs necessary to complete portions of the business transformation plan, cash settlement necessary to exit contractual obligations and other costs. Other expenses of $22 million were also recorded in 2000, including fixed asset impairments of $20 million (of which $16 million related to information systems assets), as well as $2 million of other costs. For 2001, expenses included costs related to termination benefits of $109 million, covering notification to 3,150 employees. Other costs to exit an activity of $21 million were incurred, which included $10 million for abandoned leases and $11 million for direct costs necessary to complete portions of the business transformation plan and cash settlements necessary to exit contractual obligations. Other expenses of $88 million were recorded in 2001. Aon's automotive finance servicing business, which was sold in fourth quarter 2003 (see note 1), had acted as a servicing agent for a limited partnership affiliated with automobile dealerships to provide auto financing to dealerships on a cooperative basis through various financing conduit facilities. This subsidiary also had a general partnership interest in the limited partnership. Continued competition from financing provided by the financing arms of automobile manufacturers caused Aon to evaluate whether it wished to continue in this servicing partner relationship. In first quarter 2001, Aon elected to cease servicing new business and run off its existing service obligation. The limited partnership affiliated with automobile dealerships established allowances for uncollectible loan balances. In conjunction with the decision to discontinue new auto financing receivables, the limited partners are not obligated to contribute additional capital beyond what they have already provided for any shortfall in the reserves for their individual book of business. Aon was required to fund any shortfalls in accordance with Aon's limited recourse to the funding facility arranged by the servicing agent. The servicing agent estimated the liability that Aon would have for the existing shortfall at the time Aon decided to discontinue new auto loan financing under the facility. Aon recorded a charge to establish this obligation in accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, which amounted to an expense of $44 million. For the year 2000, the last full year of operation, these servicing operations, which were reclassed to discontinued operations, generated revenue of $42 million and pretax income of $3 million. During 2001, Aon exited four other joint venture operations as a part of its business transformation process. The total cost to exit these four joint ventures was $12 million. Additional expenses in 2001 included a provision of $14 million for discontinuing supplemental accident and health insurance business operations in Mississippi. The expense included severance costs and expenses associated with the reassignment of agents, as well as estimated costs for resolving asserted and unasserted claims and suits. A $5 million expense was recorded relating to the write-down of certain agent receivables in conjunction with the restructuring of a worksite marketing agent commission pay structure and operations. Further fixed asset impairments of $10 million (of which $9 million related to information systems assets) were taken in 2001, as well as $3 million of other costs. 84 In the second quarter 2002, $6 million of pretax costs previously incurred in connection with the business transformation plan in the U.S. were reversed and included as a credit to general expenses. Approximately 3,700 employees have either departed voluntarily or have positions that have been eliminated. All of the terminations have occurred and are related to the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment in the U.S. and the U.K. The following table sets forth the activity related to the liability for termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity: (millions) Termination Benefits Other Costs to Exit an Activity Total Balance at December 31, 2000 $ 41 $ 3 $ 44 Expense charged in 2001 109 21 130 Cash payments in 2001 (73 ) (20 ) (93 ) Foreign currency revaluation (2 ) — (2 ) Balance at December 31, 2001 75 4 79 Credit to expense in 2002 (6 ) — (6 ) Cash payments in 2002 (46 ) (3 ) (49 ) Foreign currency revaluation 4 — 4 Balance at December 31, 2002 27 1 28 Cash payments in 2003 (16 ) (1 ) (17 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 11 $ — $ 11 All of Aon's unpaid liabilities relating to the business transformation plan are reflected in general expense liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Termination benefits of $6 million and $3 million are expected to be paid in 2004 and 2005, respectively, with the remainder payable thereafter. 85 6. Discontinued Operations — Alexander and Alexander Services, Inc. (A&A) Prior to its acquisition by Aon, A&A discontinued its property and casualty insurance underwriting operations in 1985, some of which were then placed into run-off, with the remainder sold in 1987. In connection with those sales, A&A provided indemnities to the purchaser for various estimated and potential liabilities, including provisions to cover future losses attributable to insurance pooling arrangements, a stop-loss reinsurance agreement and actions or omissions by various underwriting agencies previously managed by an A&A subsidiary. During first quarter 2002 and second quarter 2003, Aon settled certain of these liabilities. The settlements had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2003, the liabilities associated with the foregoing indemnities were included in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Such liabilities amounted to $20 million, net of reinsurance recoverables and other assets of $85 million. The insurance liabilities represent estimates of known and future claims expected to be settled over the next 20 to 30 years, principally with regards to asbestos, pollution and other health exposures. Although these insurance liabilities represent a best estimate of the probable liabilities, adverse developments may occur given the nature of the information available and the variables inherent in the estimation processes. Based on current estimates, management believes that the established liabilities of discontinued operations are sufficient. 86 7.

Aon's fixed-maturity portfolio in total had a $27 million gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2003, excluding $3 million related to deferred amortizable derivative losses, and is subject to interest rate, market, and credit risks. No single position had an unrealized loss greater than $1 million. With a carrying value of over $2.75 billion at December 31, 2003, our total fixed-maturity portfolio is over 96% investment grade based on market value. Fixed-maturity securities with an unrealized loss are all investment grade and have a weighted average rating of ""Aa"" based on amortized cost. Aon's non publicly-traded fixed maturity portfolio had a carrying value of $276 million, including $115 million in notes received from PEPS I on December 31, 2001 related to the securitization of limited partnerships and $64 million in notes issued by PEPS I to Aon during 2003 and 2002. Valuations of these securities primarily reflect the fundamental analysis of the issuer and current market price of comparable securities. Aon's equity portfolio is comprised of non-redeemable preferred stocks, publicly traded common stocks and other common and preferred stocks not publicly traded. This portfolio had no gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2003, and is subject to interest rate, market, credit, illiquidity, concentration and operation performance risks. Aon periodically reviews securities with material unrealized losses and evaluates them for other than temporary impairments. Aon analyzes various risk factors and determines if any specific asset impairments exist. If there is a specific asset impairment, Aon recognizes a realized loss and adjusts the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value. Aon reviews invested assets with material unrealized losses each quarter. Those assets are separated into two categories: (1)assets with unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events, which are segmented among four categories: fixed-maturity investments; preferred stocks; publicly traded common stocks; and private common stocks and other invested assets. (2)assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events. Assets with unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events: Fixed maturity investments. At least quarterly, Aon: •reviews the creditworthiness of corporate obligors for changes by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and changes in fundamental financial performance of the underlying entity, •monitors cash flow trends and underlying levels of collateral for asset-backed securities, and •evaluates all bonds and asset-backed securities whose financial performance has declined for other than temporary impairment. Preferred stocks. Aon reviews issuer creditworthiness at least quarterly. Creditworthiness factors reviewed include nationally recognized credit rating agency rating changes and changes in financial performance of the underlying issuer. Aon monitors all preferred stock investments with declining financial performance for other-than-temporary impairment. Publicly-traded common stocks. Quarterly, Aon reviews each common stock investment to determine if its decline in value is deemed other-than-temporary. Criteria include a review of issuer financial trends, and market expectations based on third-party forward-looking analytical reports, when available. 91 Private common stocks and other invested assets. Aon reviews quarterly private issue valuations, which include recent transaction valuations between the issuer and a third party; financial performance reviews; and financial trend comparisons with publicly-traded companies in the same or similar industries. Aon recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment loss when appropriate for these investments with continuous material unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events. This decision is based upon the facts and circumstances for each investment. Assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events: Invested assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events include those negatively impacted by increasing U.S. Treasury or local sovereign interest rates; corporate and asset-backed credit spread widening; common stock price volatility due to conditions in the overall market or a particular industry; and illiquid market conditions. Under some conditions, it is assumed that a decline in value below cost is not other-than-temporary. This assumption is made for fixed-maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events when the market is expected to recover, and Aon has the intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or the market recovers, which is a decisive factor when considering an impairment loss. If the decision that holding the investment no longer makes sense, Aon will reevaluate that investment for other-than-temporary impairment. An evaluation is made for other-than-temporary impairment for preferred and common stock and other investments with continuous material unrealized losses for two consecutive quarters due to market conditions or industry-related events. An other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized based upon each investment's facts and circumstances. Aon continues to monitor these securities quarterly to ensure that unrealized losses are not the result of issuer-specific events. Limited Partnership Securitization. On December 31, 2001, Aon sold the vast majority of its limited partnership (LP) portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company which is owned by one of Aon's subsidiaries (49%) and by a charitable trust, which is not controlled by Aon, established for victims of the September 11th attacks (51%). Approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities were sold by PEPS I to unaffiliated third parties. PEPS I then paid Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries the $171 million in cash and issued to them an additional $279 million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities. The fixed-maturity securities Aon subsidiaries received from PEPS I are rated as investment grade by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Aon recognized impairment writedowns on a portion of the preferred stock securities of $27 million and $32 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. As part of this transaction, the insurance underwriting subsidiaries are required to purchase from PEPS I additional fixed-maturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments, as they are requested. In 2003 and 2002, Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries funded $20 million and $38 million of commitments, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, these unfunded commitments amounted to $80 million. Based on the downgrades to Aon and the underwriting subsidiaries made by the ratings agencies in October 2002, credit support arrangements were put in place in January 2003, whereby $100 million of cash of one of Aon's underwriting subsidiaries was pledged as collateral for these commitments. These credit support arrangements have been reduced to $77 million at December 31, 2003. If the insurance underwriting subsidiaries fail to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities as commitments are drawn down, Aon has guaranteed their purchase. These commitments have specific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments. 92 To achieve the benefits of the securitization, Aon gave up all future voting interests in and control over the limited partnership interests sold to PEPS I and has no voting interest, control or significant influence over the business activities of PEPS I. Aon has obtained a true sale/non-consolidation opinion from qualified external legal counsel. PEPS I holds limited partnership investments. The legal documents that established PEPS I specify the actions that PEPS I and the servicer will undertake when PEPS I is required to make a voting decision (due to the general partner of a limited partnership calling for the vote of limited partners or proxy voting on a money market fund that PEPS I is invested in). Additionally, the legal documents contain specific instructions regarding actions to be taken if PEPS I receives (or has the ability to receive) distributions of investments held by limited partnerships in which it is invested. In instances where the general partner of a given investment may distribute underlying invested company shares to the limited partners (such as PEPS I), the legal documents that establish PEPS I outline very specific disposal instructions. Throughout the life of PEPS I, at least 10% of the beneficial interests will be held by parties other than Aon, its affiliates, or its agents. This 10% threshold is accomplished through the first tranche notes outstanding to unaffiliated third party investors. PEPS I will invest cash collected from the limited partnerships pending distribution to holders of beneficial interests. PEPS I invests only in relatively risk free investments with maturities no later than an expected distribution date. All holders of each of the above beneficial interests have the right to pledge or exchange (sell), without any constraints, the beneficial interests that they hold. As such, there are no conditions that constrain the beneficial interest holders from pledging or exchanging their beneficial interest(s) and provide the transferor with more than a trivial benefit. Other Securities on deposit for regulatory authorities as required by law, all relating to the insurance underwriting subsidiaries, amounted to $477 million at December 31, 2003 and $343 million at December 31, 2002. Aon maintains premium trust bank accounts for premiums collected from insureds but not yet remitted to insurance companies of $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Aon had $136 million and $129 million, respectively, of non-income producing investments, which excludes private equity investments carried on the equity method, held for at least twelve months, that have not declared dividends during 2003 and 2002. 93 8. Debt and Lease Commitments Notes Payable The following is a summary of notes payable: (millions) As of December 31 2003 2002 8.205% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due January 2027 $ 726 $ — 3.5% convertible debt securities, due November 2012 296 296 6.2% debt securities, due January 2007 (1) 250 250 8.65% debt securities, due May 2005 250 250 7.375% debt securities, due December 2012 223 223 6.9% debt securities, due July 2004 216 216 6.3% debt securities, due January 2004 89 89 6.7% debt securities, due June 2003 — 150 LIBOR +1% debt securities, (3.025% at December 31, 2002) due January 2003 — 150 Notes payable, due in varying installments, with interest at 1.2% to 17.76% 45 47 Total notes payable $ 2,095 $ 1,671 (1)Rate increased to 6.7% in January 2003. In January 1997, Aon created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities. As part of the financing of the A&A acquisition, Aon received cash and an investment in 100% of the common equity of Aon Capital A by issuing 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (subordinated debt) to Aon Capital A. Aon has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and was required to deconsolidate the Trust upon the adoption of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003. As a result of the deconsolidation, Aon increased its notes payable for the subordinated debt by $726 million. Interest is payable semi-annually on the subordinated debt. The debt is due January 1, 2027. (See note 11, ""Redeemable Preferred Stock, Capital Securities and Stockholders' Equity"" for further information on Aon Capital A.) In November 2002, Aon completed a private offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% convertible senior debentures due 2012. Net proceeds from this offering were $296 million. The debentures are unsecured obligations and are convertible into Aon common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately $21.475 per common share under certain circumstances including (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after December 31, 2002, if the closing price of Aon's common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price (i.e. $25.77) for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter or (2) subject to certain exceptions, during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures for each day of the ten trading day period was less than 95% of the product of the closing sale price of Aon's common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of the debentures. Aon will be required to pay additional contingent interest, beginning November 15, 2007, if the trading price of the debentures for each of the five trading days immediately preceding the first day of the six month interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the par value of the debentures. Aon has reserved approximately 14 million shares for the potential conversion of these debentures. Beginning November 19, 2007, Aon may redeem any of the debentures at an initial redemption price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The debentures were sold to qualified institutional buyers. In 2003, Aon filed a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of the debentures. 94 In December 2002, Aon completed a private offering of $225 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior notes due 2012. Net proceeds from this offering were $223 million. During 2003, Aon completed an offer to exchange these notes for notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and having identical terms. Aon has used the net proceeds of both offerings to repay outstanding commercial paper, other short-term debt, and certain other notes payable. In addition, some of the funds were used to repurchase a portion of Aon Capital A's 8.205% Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Capital Securities (see note 11). A portion of the funds were invested and utilized to repay $150 million of LIBOR +1% debt securities that matured in January 2003. In December 2001, Aon issued $150 million of debt securities with a floating interest rate of LIBOR +1% due January 2003 and $250 million of 6.2% debt securities due January 2007. The interest rate payable on the 6.2% debt securities is subject to adjustment in the event that Aon's credit ratings change. Due to the ratings downgrades during 2002, the interest rate on the 6.2% debt securities was increased to 6.7%, effective January 2003. Interest is payable semi-annually on most debt securities. In addition, the debt securities, including Aon Capital A's, are not redeemable by Aon prior to maturity except for the 3.5% convertible debt securities, which are redeemable by Aon beginning in 2007. There are no sinking fund provisions. Maturities of notes payable are $318 million, $255 million, $5 million, $254 million and $8 million in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. In September 2001, certain of Aon's European subsidiaries entered into a new committed bank credit facility under which they can borrow up to €500 million. Both the 364-day and five year portion of the facility were for €250 million. The 364-day portion of the facility was renewed in September 2003 for an additional 364-day period and the amount was increased to €285 million. Commitment fees of 12 basis points are payable on the unused short-term portion and 18.75 basis points on the unused long-term portion. At December 31, 2003, Aon had borrowed €38 million ($48 million) under this facility which is classified as short-term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial position. Aon has guaranteed the obligations of its subsidiaries with respect to this facility. Aon had $775 million of other unused committed bank credit facilities at December 31, 2003 to support commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. Both the 364-day and three year portion of the facility were for $437.5 million. The 364-day facility was reduced by $100 million to $337.5 million when it was renewed in February 2003. This facility was renewed in February 2004. Commitment fees of 10 basis points are payable on the unused short-term portion and 12.5 basis points on the unused long-term portion. The facility requires Aon to maintain consolidated net worth, as defined, of at least $2.5 billion, a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated interest expense of 4 to 1 and contains certain other restrictions relating to mergers and the sale or pledging of assets. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2003. Information related to notes payable and short-term borrowings is as follows: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Interest paid (millions) $ 103 $ 123 $ 127 Weighted-average interest rates — short-term borrowings 2.6 % 3.3 % 4.5 % Lease Commitments Aon has noncancelable operating leases for certain office space, equipment and automobiles. Rental expenses for all operating leases amounted to $381 million in 2003, $289 million in 2002 and 95 $242 million in 2001. Future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2003 are: (millions) 2004 $ 354 2005 317 2006 269 2007 222 2008 186 Later years 877 Total minimum payments required $ 2,225 96 9. Income Tax Aon and its principal domestic subsidiaries are included in a consolidated life-nonlife federal income tax return. Aon's international subsidiaries file various income tax returns in their jurisdictions. Income from continuing operations (loss) before income tax and the provision for income tax consist of the following: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax: U.S. $ 361 $ 197 $ (7 ) International 749 627 375 Total $ 1,110 $ 824 $ 368 Provision for income tax: Current: Federal $ 87 $ 44 $ 34 International 209 191 122 State 43 14 10 Total current 339 249 166 Deferred (credit): Federal 45 28 (28 ) International 18 21 9 State 9 6 (2 ) Total deferred 72 55 (21 ) Provision for income tax $ 411 $ 304 $ 145 During 2003, 2002 and 2001, Aon's consolidated statements of income reflect a tax benefit of $22 million, $24 million and $26 million, respectively, on the 8.205% Capital Securities issued in January 1997 (see note 11). A reconciliation of the income tax provisions based on the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to the provisions reflected in the consolidated financial statements is as follows: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 3.0 1.6 1.4 Taxes on international operations (2.3 ) (2.3 ) (0.8 ) Amortization of intangible assets relating to acquired businesses 0.1 0.3 4.3 Other — net 1.2 2.4 (0.4 ) Effective tax rate 37.0 % 37.0 % 39.5 % 97 Significant components of Aon's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: (millions) As of December 31 2003 2002 Deferred tax assets: Employee benefit plans $ 469 $ 400 Unearned and advanced premiums and contract fees 160 150 Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 82 82 Certain purchase accounting and special charges 28 32 Unrealized foreign exchange losses 16 171 Other 99 141 Total 854 976 Deferred tax liabilities: Policy acquisition costs (189 ) (167 ) Unrealized investment gains (45 ) (16 ) Other (68 ) (71 ) Total (302 ) (254 ) Valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (28 ) (33 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 524 $ 689 Valuation allowances have been established primarily with regard to the tax benefits of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. To the extent valuation allowances were provided through acquisition accounting, tax benefits recognized for such items would reduce goodwill. The valuation allowances changed to $28 million in 2003 from $33 million in 2002, attributable largely to the utilization of certain international net operating loss carryforwards. Although future earnings cannot be predicted with certainty, management currently believes that realization of the net deferred tax asset is more likely than not. At December 31, 2003, Aon had domestic federal operating loss carryforwards of $43 million which will expire at various dates from 2004 to 2021, state operating loss carryforwards of $357 million which will expire at various dates from 2004 to 2024, and foreign operating loss carryforwards of $111 million, which expire at various dates. Prior to 1984, life insurance companies were required to accumulate certain untaxed amounts in a memorandum ""policyholders' surplus account."" Under the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the ""policyholders' surplus account"" balances were ""capped"" at December 31, 1983, and the balances will be taxed only to the extent distributed to stockholders or when they exceed certain prescribed limits. As of December 31, 2003, the combined ""policyholders' surplus account"" of Aon's life insurance subsidiaries approximates $363 million. Aon's life insurance subsidiaries do not intend to make any taxable distributions or exceed the prescribed limits in the foreseeable future; therefore, no income tax provision has been made. However, if such taxes were assessed, the amount of taxes payable would be approximately $127 million. The amount of income taxes paid in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $296 million, $238 million and $193 million, respectively. 98 10. Reinsurance and Claim Reserves Aon's insurance subsidiaries are involved in both the cession and assumption of reinsurance with other companies. Aon's reinsurance consists primarily of short-duration contracts that are entered into with the captive insurance operations of numerous automobile dealerships and insurers, certain newer accident and health initiatives, as well as certain property casualty lines. Aon's insurance subsidiaries remain liable to the extent that the reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations. A summary of reinsurance activity is as follows: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Ceded premiums earned $ 1,261 $ 1,190 $ 921 Ceded premiums written 1,307 1,371 1,020 Assumed premiums earned 366 493 391 Assumed premiums written 382 533 384 Ceded benefits to policyholders 796 703 630 Activity in the liability for policy contract claims is summarized as follows: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Liabilities at beginning of year $ 529 $ 455 $ 377 Incurred losses: Current year 1,319 1,174 1,110 Prior years (1) 87 86 (11 ) Total 1,406 1,260 1,099 Payment of claims: Current year (798 ) (834 ) (769 ) Prior years (386 ) (352 ) (252 ) Total (1,184 ) (1,186 ) (1,021 ) Liabilities at end of year (net of reinsurance recoverables: 2003 — $858; 2002 — $722; 2001 — $482) $ 751 $ 529 $ 455 (1)For 2003 and 2002, prior years' incurred losses primarily represent losses from business produced by NPS. Aon stopped NPS from initiating any new business in mid-2002. 99 11. Redeemable Preferred Stock, Capital Securities and Stockholders' Equity Redeemable Preferred Stock At December 31, 2003, one million shares of redeemable preferred stock were outstanding. Dividends are cumulative at an annual rate of $2.55 per share. The shares of redeemable preferred stock will be redeemable at the option of Aon or the holders, in whole or in part, at $50.00 per share beginning one year after the occurrence of a certain future event. Capital Securities In January 1997, Aon created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust, for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (Capital Securities). The sole asset of Aon Capital A is a $726 million aggregate principal amount of Aon's 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (subordinated debt) due January 1, 2027. The back-up guarantees, in the aggregate, provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the Trust's obligations under the Capital Securities. Aon Capital A issued $800 million of 8.205% capital securities in January 1997. The proceeds from the issuance of the Capital Securities were used to finance a portion of the A&A acquisition. Aon received $800 million in cash and a $24 million investment in 100% of the common equity of Aon Capital A by issuing $824 million of subordinated debt. During 2002, approximately $98 million (face value) of the Capital Securities were repurchased on the open market and were used to retire $98 million of the debt to Aon Capital A. The Capital Securities are subject to mandatory redemption on January 1, 2027 (upon the maturity of the subordinated debt) or, are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the option of Aon (through its prepayment of the subordinated debt) upon the occurrence of certain events. Interest is payable semi-annually on the Capital Securities. The Capital Securities are categorized in the December 31, 2002 consolidated statements of financial position as ""Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding Solely Aon's Junior Subordinated Debentures."" Aon has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and was required to deconsolidate the Trust upon the adoption of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003. As a result of the deconsolidation, Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding Solely Aon's Junior Subordinated Debentures decreased by $702 million, completely offset by an increase in notes payable and other receivables of $726 million and $24 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003. Prior to the deconsolidation of Aon Capital A, the after-tax interest incurred on the Capital Securities was reported as minority interest in the consolidated statements of income. Beginning in 2004, interest expense on these notes payable will be reported as part of interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. There was no effect on net income or consolidated stockholders' equity as a result of this deconsolidation. (Prior periods were not restated.) Common Stock In December 2001, Aon filed a universal shelf registration on Form S-3 for the issuance of $750 million of debt and equity securities. In November 2002, Aon completed a public offering of 36.8 million shares of its common stock at $17.18 per share, raising net proceeds of $607 million. Aon has used the net proceeds to repay commercial paper and other short-term debt. A portion of the funds were invested and were utilized to repay debt maturing in 2003. Aon repurchased 0.1 million, 0.4 million and 0.1 million shares in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, of its common stock. In 2003, Aon issued 2.6 million new shares of common stock for 100 employee benefit plans, 350,000 shares in connection with the employee stock purchase plan, and 623,000 shares in connection with current year acquisitions and commitments from previous acquisitions. In addition, 390,000 shares were issued from available treasury shares in connection with the employee stock purchase plan. In connection with the acquisition of two entities controlled by Aon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2001 (note 4), Aon obtained approximately 22.4 million shares of its common stock. These treasury shares are restricted as to their reissuance. The acquisition was financed by the issuance of approximately 22.4 million new shares of Aon stock. At December 31, 2003, there are approximately 32,000 shares of stock held in treasury which are not restricted as to their reissuance. Dividends A summary of dividends declared is as follows: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Redeemable preferred stock $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 Common stock 187 230 238 Total dividends declared $ 190 $ 233 $ 241 Statutory Capital and Surplus Generally, the capital and surplus of Aon's insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to the parent company are limited to the amounts that the insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus exceed minimum statutory capital requirements; however, payments of the amounts as dividends in excess of $133 million may be subject to approval by regulatory authorities. See note 9 for possible tax effects of distributions made out of untaxed earnings. Net statutory income (loss) of the insurance subsidiaries is summarized as follows: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Accident & Health and Life $ 95 $ (13 ) $ (61 ) Warranty, Credit and Property & Casualty (21 ) (64 ) 60 Statutory capital and surplus of the insurance subsidiaries is summarized as follows: (millions) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Accident & Health and Life $ 700 $ 537 $ 421 Warranty, Credit and Property & Casualty 611 448 484 101 12. Employee Benefits Savings and Profit Sharing Plans Aon subsidiaries maintain contributory savings plans for the benefit of U.S. salaried and commissioned employees. Provisions made for these plans were $54 million, $48 million and $43 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Aon sponsors defined benefit, pension and postretirement health and welfare plans that provide retirement, medical and life insurance benefits. The postretirement healthcare plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance and pension plans are noncontributory. Effective January 1, 2004, the U.S. pension plans were closed to new entrants. All new employees will participate in a defined contribution plan. Previously, Aon's U.K. pension plans became closed to new entrants. All new employees became participants in a defined contribution plan. On November 30, 2003, Aon changed its U.S. retiree medical program. All future post-65 retirees (current active employees and current retirees under age 65) will no longer be offered the Aon Medicare Supplement plan upon attainment of age 65. Instead, future post-65 retirees will be offered plans through individual insured arrangements. Aon may subsidize $50 per month per individual for these plans. The impact of this change was a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of November 30, 2003 of $12 million. This amount will be amortized over the next 10 years. U.S. Pension and Other Benefit Plans The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in obligations and fair value of assets for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and a statement of the funded status as of 102 December 31, 2003 and 2002, for both qualified and nonqualified plans. The measurement date for the U.S. plans is November 30.

In 2003, plans with a projected benefit obligation (PBO) and an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $1.3 billion, an ABO of $1.2 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $0.9 billion. In 2002, plans with a PBO and ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $1.1 billion, an ABO of $1.0 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $0.8 billion. 103 The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for the plans for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: (millions) Pension Benefits 2003 2002 2001 Service cost $ 52 $ 46 $ 33 Interest cost 77 72 65 Expected return on plan assets (78 ) (108 ) (104 ) Amortization of prior-service cost (2 ) (2 ) (1 ) Amortization of net (gain) loss 11 2 (8 ) Net periodic benefit cost (credit) $ 60 $ 10 $ (15 ) (millions) Other Benefits 2003 2002 2001 Service cost $ 3 $ 3 $ 2 Interest cost 5 5 5 Amortization of net gain — (1 ) (1 ) Net periodic benefit cost $ 8 $ 7 $ 6 The weighted-average assumptions used to determine future U.S. benefit obligations are shown in the following table: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2003 2002 2003 2002 Discount rate 6.25 % 7.0 % 6.25 % 7.0 % Rate of compensation increase 3.5 3.5 — 3.5 The weighted-average assumptions used to determine U.S. net periodic benefit costs for the periods below are shown in the following table: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Discount rate 7.0 % 7.5 % 8.3 % 7.0 % 7.5 % 8.3 % Expected return on plan assets 8.5 10.25 10.25 — — — Rate of compensation increase 3.5 4.0 4.0 3.5 4.0 4.0 Long-term Rate of Return To determine the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan, the historical performance, investment community forecasts and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plan. In setting the individual asset assumptions, the historical performance data series were weighted most heavily toward the geometric average returns. The expected returns for each asset class were then weighted by the target allocations of the plan. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used to determine pension expense is 8.5%. 104 Plan Assets Aon's U.S. pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2003 and 2002 is as follows: Fair Value of Plan Assets Allocation Range Target Allocation Asset Class 2003 2002 Equities 50 – 80 % 70% 61 % 62 % Domestic Equities 40 – 70 40 32 34 International Equities 5 – 15 10 7 4 Limited Partnerships and Other 2.5 – 20 10 15 15 Real Estate and REITs 5 – 15 10 3 0 Aon Common Stock 0 – 5 No Target 4 9 Debt Securities 20 – 50 30 39 38 Fixed Maturities 20 – 50 23 24 8 Invested Cash 2.5 – 15 7 15 30 Total 100 % 100 % Pension plan assets include Aon stock in the amounts of $34 million and $68 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Dividends from Aon stock received by the plan in 2003 and 2002 were $1.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Invested cash as of the plan measurement date in 2003 and 2002 included amounts in transit of $100 million and $86 million, respectively. Investment Policy and Strategy The policy, as established by the Aon Pension Plan Investment Committee, seeks reasonable asset growth at prudent risk levels within target allocations. Plan assets are invested within the asset allocation target ranges shown above, are well-diversified, and are of appropriate quality. Asset allocation target ranges are reviewed quarterly and re-balanced to within policy target allocations. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually, and revised, as deemed appropriate by the Investment Committee. Aon's U.S. other benefit plan assets of $8 million at both December 31, 2003 and 2002 were invested in money market instruments. Cash Flows Contributions Based on current assumptions, Aon expects to contribute $28 million to U.S. pension plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements and $8 million to fund other postretirement benefit plans during 2004. The postretirement benefit plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. 105 Estimated Future Benefit Payments Estimated future benefit payments reflecting expected future service for the years ending December 31: (millions) Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2004 $ 56 $ 8 2005 57 8 2006 60 8 2007 63 9 2008 67 9 2009 — 2013 429 45 Assumptions for Other Postretirement Benefits Assumed health care cost trend rates at December 31: 2003 2002 Assumed healthcare cost trend rate 11.0 % 11.5 % Ultimate trend rate 5.5 % 5.5 % Year that the ultimate trend rate is reached 2014 2014 Aon's liability for future plan cost increase for pre-65 and Medical Supplement plan coverage is limited in any year to 5% per annum. Because of this cap, net employer trend rates for these plans are effectively limited to 5% per year in the future. The $50 per month subsidy for future post-65 retirees is assumed not to increase in future years. Therefore, there is no employer trend for future post-65 retirees. As a result, a 1% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates has no effect on the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement healthcare benefit cost and on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the measurement period ended in 2003. International Pension Plans The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in obligations and fair value of assets for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and a statement of the funded status as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, for material international pension plans, which are located in the U.K. 106 and The Netherlands. The measurement date for these plans is September 30 and December 31, respectively.

In 2003, plans with a PBO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $3.3 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $2.2 billion, and plans with an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had an ABO of $2.7 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $2.0 billion. In 2002, plans with a PBO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $2.7 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $1.8 billion, and plans with an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had an ABO of $2.1 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $1.6 billion. 107 The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit cost for the international plans for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: (millions) 2003 2002 2001 Service cost $ 51 $ 45 $ 51 Interest cost 152 133 124 Expected return on plan assets (134 ) (163 ) (182 ) Amortization of net loss 58 31 11 Net periodic benefit cost $ 127 $ 46 $ 4 The range of weighted-average assumptions used to determine future international benefit obligations are shown in the following table.

Stock Compensation Plans In 2001, Aon stockholders approved the Aon Stock Incentive Plan, which replaced all existing incentive compensation plans, including the Aon Stock Award Plan and the Aon Stock Option Plan. Under the new plan, non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards may be granted. The annual rate of which awards are granted each year is based upon financial and competitive business conditions. The number of shares authorized to be issued under the new plan is equal to 18% of the number of common shares outstanding. Stock Awards Generally, employees are required to complete three continuous years of service before the award begins to vest in increments until the completion of a 10-year period of continuous employment. In both 2003 and 2002, a large number of awards were granted that vest annually over five years, with the initial vesting occurring after one year of continuous service. In general, most awarded shares are issued as they become vested. In certain circumstances, an employee can elect to defer the receipt of vested shares to a later date. With certain limited exceptions, any break in continuous employment will cause forfeiture of all unvested awards. The compensation cost associated with each award is deferred and amortized over the period of continuous employment using the straight-line method. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the number of shares available for award is included with options available for grant.

Generally, employees are required to complete two continuous years of service before the options begin to vest in increments until the completion of a 4-year period of continuous employment. For all grants made prior to an amendment to the former stock option plan in 2000, employees were required to complete three continuous years of service before the options began to vest in increments until the completion of a 6-year period of continuous employment. 109 A summary of Aon's stock option activity (including options granted pursuant to the former Aon Stock Award Plan) and related information consists of the following: (shares in thousands) Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Beginning outstanding 24,478 $ 32 21,298 $ 32 16,156 $ 29 Granted 9,226 20 5,552 34 7,647 34 Exercised (13 ) 24 (877 ) 20 (1,751 ) 18 Canceled (2,064 ) 27 (1,495 ) 33 (754 ) 32 Ending outstanding 31,627 $ 29 24,478 $ 32 21,298 $ 32 Exercisable at end of year 9,574 $ 32 5,308 $ 30 2,538 $ 29 Options available for grant 15,742 22,771 14,444 A summary of options outstanding and exercisable is as follows: (Shares in thousands) As of December 31, 2003 Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Exercise Prices Shares Outstanding Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (years) Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares Exercisable Weighted- Average Exercise Price $14.92 – $14.92 311 8.61 $ 14.92 — $ 0 15.53 – 19.70 6,599 9.19 19.59 100 18.32 19.76 – 21.99 2,088 9.17 21.29 6 19.76 22.01 – 23.94 5,390 6.48 23.76 3,136 23.93 24.02 – 32.53 5,581 6.30 31.26 2,899 30.59 32.64 – 36.88 8,297 7.74 36.02 1,398 35.11 37.13 – 49.29 3,361 4.74 43.29 2,035 43.30 $14.92 – $49.29 31,627 7.36 $ 29.26 9,574 $ 31.64 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Effective July 1, 1998, Aon adopted an employee stock purchase plan that provides for the purchase of a maximum of 7.5 million shares of Aon's common stock by eligible U.S. employees. Under the original plan, shares of Aon's common stock could be purchased at 6-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or the last day of each 6-month period. Effective July 1, 2000, the plan was amended by changing the purchase period to 3-month intervals. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, 734,000 shares, 312,000 shares, and 680,000 shares, respectively, were issued to employees under the plan. In first quarter 2002, the plan was suspended in anticipation of the planned divestiture of the insurance underwriting businesses (note 1). The plan was reactivated as of January 1, 2003. There was no compensation expense associated with this plan. 110 14. Financial Instruments Financial Risk Management Aon is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity securities prices. To manage the risk related to these exposures, Aon enters into various derivative transactions that have the effect of reducing these risks by creating offsetting market exposures. If Aon did not use derivative contracts, then its exposure to market risk would be higher. Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses. Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. The credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to Aon. Aon has limited its credit risk by entering into non-exchange-traded derivatives with highly rated major financial institutions and by using exchange-traded instruments. Aon closely monitors the credit-worthiness of, and exposure to, its counterparties and considers its credit risk to be minimal. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Aon placed cash and securities relating to these derivative contracts in escrow amounting to $4 million and $11 million, respectively. Foreign currency forward contracts (forwards) and interest rate swaps entered into require no up-front premium. Forwards settle at the expiration of the related contract. The net effect of swap payments is settled periodically and reported in income. The premium and commission paid for purchased options, including interest rate caps and floors, and premium received, net of commission paid, for written options represents the cost basis of the position until it expires or is closed. The commission paid for futures contracts represents the cost basis of the position, until it expires or is closed. Exchange-traded futures are valued and settled daily. Unless otherwise noted, derivative instruments are generally reported in other receivables and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Accounting Policy for Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivative is designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting. Statement No. 133 identifies three hedging relationships where a derivative (hedging instrument) may qualify for hedge accounting: a hedge of the change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or firm commitment (fair value hedge), a hedge of the variability in cash flows from a recognized asset or liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge) and a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary. In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge in a foreign subsidiary by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation includes Aon's risk management objective, strategy, and method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at both inception and on an ongoing basis. For a highly effective hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument must be expected to substantially offset changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Aon assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges at the end of each quarter. The change in fair value of a hedging instrument designated and qualified as a fair value hedge and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are both recognized currently in earnings. The effective portion of the change in fair value of a hedging 111 instrument designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) and subsequently reclassified to income when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. For a derivative designated and qualified as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary, the effective portion of the change in fair value is reported in OCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary is recognized immediately in earnings. Foreign Exchange Risk Management Certain of Aon's foreign brokerage subsidiaries, primarily in the U.K., receive revenues in currencies (primarily in U.S. dollars) that differ from their functional currencies. To reduce the foreign exchange rate variability of cash flows from these transactions, Aon uses foreign exchange forwards and options to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted revenue. Aon has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges of its forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. As of December 31, 2003, a $79 million pretax gain has been deferred to OCI, $49 million of which is expected to impact general expenses in 2004. Deferred gains or losses will be reclassified from OCI to general expenses when the hedged revenue is recognized. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded. Aon uses over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of Aon's foreign operations. These derivatives are not afforded hedge accounting as defined by Statement No. 133. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Aon also uses foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denominated inter-company notes. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, there were no designated and qualifying hedges of this exposure. In 2000, Aon entered into a cross currency swap to hedge the foreign currency and interest rate risks associated with a foreign denominated fixed-rate policyholder liability. This swap has been designated as a fair value hedge of the combined exposure. The swap was terminated in 2003 upon the extinguishment of the policyholder liability. This hedge had no material ineffectiveness. Interest Rate Risk Management Aon uses futures contracts and purchases options on futures contracts to reduce the price volatility of its fixed-maturity portfolio. Derivatives designated and qualified as hedging specific fixed-income securities are accounted for as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are recorded in investment income. Prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 133, realized gains and losses on derivatives that qualified as hedges were deferred and reported as an adjustment of the cost basis of the hedged item and are being amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged items. Aon occasionally enters into interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of its fixed-rate notes. The interest rate swaps qualify as fair value hedges and there was no ineffectiveness recorded. Realized gains and losses on swaps qualified as hedges are deferred and reported as adjustments of the cost basis of the hedged items and are being amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged items. Prior to the adoption of Statement No. 133, Aon purchased futures contracts to hedge the fair value of its fixed-rate notes from changes in interest rates. Aon deferred the gains from the termination of the contracts and is amortizing these gains as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining life of the fixed-rate notes. 112 Aon issued fixed-rate notes in May 2000. Aon purchased options on interest rate swaps to hedge against a change in interest rates prior to the issuance of the fixed-rate notes. These options qualified as a hedge of an anticipated transaction under prior accounting guidance and related gains were deferred and are being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. Upon the adoption of Statement No. 133, pretax deferred gains of $5 million were reclassified to OCI. At December 31, 2003, $2 million remains in OCI, $1 million of which is expected to offset interest expense in 2004. Aon enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements and uses exchange-traded futures and options to limit its net exposure to decreasing short-term interest rates, primarily relating to brokerage fiduciary funds in the U.S. and U.K. Aon also sells exchange-traded futures to limit its exposure to increasing long-term interest rates. There were no designated and qualified cash flow hedges of these exposures in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Changes in fair value related to these contracts were recorded in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. Equity Price Risk Management Aon sells futures contracts and purchases options to reduce the price volatility of its equity securities portfolio and equity securities it owns indirectly through limited partnership investments. There were no designated and qualified hedges of this exposure in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 133, realized gains and losses on derivatives that qualified as hedges were deferred and reported as an adjustment of the cost basis of the hedged item and are being amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item. Other Financial Instruments Prior to 2002, an Aon subsidiary issued fixed- and floating-rate Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) and floating-rate funding agreements and invested the proceeds primarily in the U.S. fixed income markets. The assets backing the GICs are subject to varying elements of credit and market risk. The last GIC was terminated in December 2003. Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) Excluding PEPS I Certain of Aon's subsidiaries make short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) to businesses for the financing of insurance premiums and then securitize the finance receivables through securitization transactions that meet the criteria for sale accounting in accordance with FASB Statement No. 140. These premium financing securitizations are accomplished through the use of special purpose entities which are considered qualifying SPEs (""QSPEs"") pursuant to Statement No. 140 and FIN 46, and commercial paper bank conduits (multi-seller non-qualified SPEs). Statement No. 140 provides that a QSPE should not be consolidated in the financial statements of a transferor or its affiliates (Aon's subsidiaries). Premium financing securitizations performed by Aon's United Kingdom, Canadian and Australian subsidiaries utilize multi-seller non-qualified SPEs. Based on an analysis of the qualitative and quantitative factors of the SPEs, Aon has determined that it is not the sponsor of the SPEs. Additionally, independent third parties (i) have made substantial equity investments in the SPEs, (ii) have voting control of the SPEs and (iii) generally have the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets of the SPEs. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46, based on these factors, Aon had determined non-consolidation to be the appropriate accounting treatment. With the adoption of FIN 46 as of December 31, 2003, Aon has determined that it does not have a significant variable interest in the multi-seller SPEs and therefore has concluded that non-consolidation continues to be appropriate. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the maximum commitment contained in these agreements were $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and the maximum credit risk under recourse provisions 113 was approximately $75 million and $97 million, respectively, which represents the extent of the limited recourse. These recourse obligations are guaranteed by Aon. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the unpaid principal amount of securitized receivables outstanding was $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Accounting standards require the disclosure of fair values for certain financial instruments. The fair value disclosures are not intended to encompass the majority of policy liabilities, various other non-financial instruments or other intangible assets related to Aon's business. Accordingly, care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about Aon's business or financial condition based on the fair value disclosures. The carrying value and fair value of certain of Aon's financial instruments are as follows: (millions) As of December 31 2003 2002 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Assets: Fixed maturities and equity securities $ 2,793 $ 2,793 $ 2,151 $ 2,151 Other investments 716 798 600 599 Cash, receivables and short-term investments (1) 14,373 14,373 13,798 13,798 Derivatives 93 93 79 79 Liabilities: Deposit-type insurance contracts 58 58 139 136 Short-term borrowings, premium payables and general expenses 11,919 11,919 11,539 11,539 Notes payable 2,095 2,229 1,671 1,754 Capital securities (2) — — 702 632 Derivatives 13 13 45 45 (1)Excludes derivatives. (2)Capital securities were deconsolidated due to adoption of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003. (See note 11 ""Capital Securities"" for further information). Guarantees and Indemnifications Aon provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others to allow Aon or others to complete a wide variety of business transactions. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Any anticipated amounts payable which are deemed to be probable and estimable are properly reflected in Aon's consolidated financial statements. Refer to ""Other Financial Instruments"" above for guarantees associated with Aon's premium financing securitizations. Guarantees associated with Aon's limited partnership securitization are disclosed in note 7. Indemnities related to discontinued operations are disclosed in note 6. Aon and its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $90 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. Amounts are accrued in the consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable. Aon has certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. Costs associated with these guarantees, to the extent estimable and probable, are provided in Aon's allowance for doubtful accounts. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $30 million at December 31, 2003. Aon expects that as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time. 114 15. Contingencies Aon and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments and lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business. The damages that may be claimed are substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive or extraordinary damages. Accruals for these items have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. A reinsurance brokerage subsidiary of Aon has been named in several lawsuits mentioned below relating to a worker's compensation reinsurance pool known as the Unicover Occupational Accident Reinsurance Pool (""Unicover Pool""). The Unicover Pool was managed by Unicover Managers, Inc. (""Unicover""), currently known as Cragwood Managers, LLC (""Cragwood""). Along with another broker, Aon's reinsurance brokerage subsidiary procured certain — although not all — retrocessional cover for the Unicover Pool. It was also involved in arranging further retrocessional protections for certain Unicover retrocessionaires. As previously reported, in 1999 Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, Inc. (""Allianz"") filed an amended complaint in Minnesota adding Aon's subsidiary as a defendant in an action which Allianz had originally brought against various retrocessionaires of the Unicover Pool. Allianz had entered into certain contracts to provide retrocessional coverage to those Unicover retrocessionaires. Allianz claims that the reinsurance it issued should be rescinded or that it should be awarded damages based on alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by the carriers through their agents including Aon's subsidiary. That case is currently stayed pending an arbitration to which Aon is not a party. Also, as previously reported in August 2002, two retrocessionaires of the Unicover Pool filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Aon subsidiary seeking to recover any damages, costs and expenses which those retrocessionaires would suffer if the Allianz coverage was rescinded or if Allianz was awarded damages. In January 2003, the carriers dismissed their lawsuit without prejudice. On May 22, 2003, five lawsuits were filed against Aon's subsidiary by different participants in the Unicover Pool. Each of these lawsuits is premised on the contention that an arbitration panel ruled in October 2002 to rescind the Unicover retrocessionaires' obligation to provide coverage to the Unicover Pool for any business bound or renewed on behalf of the Pool after August 31, 1998. Aon is generally aware of, and has previously reported, this arbitration. One of the five lawsuits is brought by Unicover Pool participants Phoenix Life Insurance Company (""Phoenix"") and General & Cologne Life Re of America (""Cologne"") in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs seek substantial damages for the alleged failure of the retrocessional coverage and for alleged breaches of contract and alleged breaches of the duty of good faith. The second lawsuit, filed by Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (""Lincoln"") in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, is similar in content to the first. The third lawsuit is brought by Phoenix and Cologne against Aon's subsidiary, unrelated broker Rattner Mackenzie Limited (""Rattner""), Cragwood, and several of the principals of Cragwood in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In this multi-count complaint, Phoenix and Cologne seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages. Phoenix and Cologne allege breaches of contract or legal duty and commission of various tortious acts, and allege among other things that Aon's brokerage subsidiary acted as a joint venturer with, and conspired with, Unicover in connection with the Unicover Pool. The fourth lawsuit is brought by Lincoln in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In this lawsuit, Lincoln seeks unspecified, but substantial, damages for various alleged torts and alleged breaches of duty in connection with the Unicover Pool. The fifth lawsuit, similar to the fourth, filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County, is brought by Unicover Pool participant ReliaStar Life Insurance Company (""ReliaStar"") against several principals of Unicover Managers, Aon's subsidiary, one of its employees, Rattner, and an employee of Rattner. 115 Aon's management has reviewed these complaints and believes that Aon's subsidiary has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself against all of these claims. As previously disclosed, the Unicover issues are complex, and therefore the timing and amount of resolution of these claims cannot be determined at this time. Certain U.K. subsidiaries of Aon have been required by their regulatory body, the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), to review advice given by those subsidiaries to individuals who bought pension plans during the period from April 1988 to June 1994. These reviews have resulted in a requirement to pay compensation to clients based on guidelines issued by the PIA. Aon has resolved the vast majority of the known claims against it. Aon has submitted to its errors and omissions (""E&O"") insurers a claim for a portion of the amounts paid, and those insurers are considering Aon's claim in due course. Although one recent decision in the U.K., which did not involve Aon, held that pension mis-selling claims could not be aggregated for purposes of applying the E&O insurance deductible, the language in that contested E&O policy is significantly different from the language in Aon's E&O policy. Aon continues to believe that its insurance claim is probable of recovery. One of Aon's insurance subsidiaries is a defendant in more than twenty lawsuits in Mississippi. The lawsuits generally allege misconduct by the subsidiary in the solicitation and sale of insurance policies. Attorneys representing the plaintiffs in these lawsuits have advised the subsidiary that approximately 2,700 other current or former policyholders may file similar claims. Each lawsuit includes, and each threatened claim could include, a request for punitive damages. Aon's insurance subsidiary has been litigating the pending suits and investigating the claims. As of the end of 2003, Aon has entered into compromise settlements of several of the lawsuits and approximately 2,000 claims. There are still at least 2,700 threatened claims outstanding. Each of the remaining lawsuits and any threatened claim is being investigated and vigorously defended. Beginning in August 2002, ten putative class action lawsuits were filed against Aon and certain of its officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaints allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated under such Act relating to Aon's press release issued on August 7, 2002. The complaints seek, among other things, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount and an award of costs and expenses, including counsel fees. All of these actions have been consolidated, and a lead plaintiff has been appointed by the court. On September 13, 2002, a purported shareholder's derivative action against Aon and each of Aon's directors was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. This lawsuit made allegations substantially similar to the original class action lawsuits. In third quarter 2003, Aon and attorneys representing plaintiffs in the purported shareholder and derivative actions agreed to settle these actions. The memorandum of understanding memorializing the settlement calls for Aon to pay a total of $7.25 million and to take certain steps relating to Aon's corporate governance, certain of which had already been undertaken by Aon. As part of that settlement, the purported derivative action was voluntarily dismissed in the Circuit Court of Cook County and refiled in federal court. The settlement is subject to a process that includes notice to putative class members and final court approval. Aon has fully reserved the settlement and estimated remaining litigation costs. In December 2001, Radmanovich v. Combined Insurance Company of America, a putative class action lawsuit seeking compensatory and punitive damages from CICA, was filed on behalf of former and current employees of CICA in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The action alleges discrimination against women in hiring, training and promotion and in tolerating a hostile work environment. The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for the plaintiff and for all women who worked for CICA since April 1, 1999. In March 2002, a second putative class action lawsuit, Palmer v. Combined, was filed against CICA in the same court, making similar allegations but seeking injunctive 116 and punitive damages on behalf of a putative class of current CICA employees. On June 26, 2003, the Court in Radmanovich denied plaintiffs' motion for class certification, after which a number of the putative class members filed individual lawsuits in the same court. Aon intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits. On September 2, 2003, the Court in Palmer granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification for injunctive and punitive damages. CICA has filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Palmer decision, and this motion is currently pending before the court. If the motion is not successful, CICA will seek to appeal the decision. With respect to all of these cases, Aon has established reserves for the expected costs and expenses. Although the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on Aon or its subsidiaries, on the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Aon. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. 117 16. Segment Information Aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services, Consulting, and Insurance Underwriting. A fourth segment, Corporate and Other, when aggregated with the operating segments and after the elimination of intersegment revenues, totals to the amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In 2003, certain business units were reclassified among segments. Certain administration and marketing services relating to Aon's insurance underwriting operations, previously included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, were reclassified into the Insurance Underwriting segment. The automotive finance servicing business, previously included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, was sold in fourth quarter 2003. Activity attributable to this business has been reflected as a discontinued operation. Certain amounts in prior periods' consolidated financial statements relating to segments and discontinued operations have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in note 1, except that the disaggregated financial results have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which Aon senior management internally disaggregates financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operating decisions. Aon evaluates performance based on stand-alone operating segment income before income taxes and generally accounts for intersegment revenue as if the revenue were from third parties, that is, at current market prices. Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues. Intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in computing consolidated revenues and income before tax. In 2003, inter-segment revenues were eliminated. Prior to 2003, there were no material inter-segment amounts to be eliminated. Long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization are not material. Consolidated revenue by geographic area follows: (millions) Total United States United Kingdom Continent of Europe Rest of World Revenue for the years ended December 31: 2003 $ 9,810 $ 5,211 $ 1,835 $ 1,469 $ 1,295 2002 8,807 5,019 1,621 1,117 1,050 2001 7,651 4,438 1,390 938 885 The Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment consists principally of Aon's retail, reinsurance and wholesale brokerage operations, as well as related insurance services, including underwriting management, captive insurance company management services, claims services, and premium financing. Our Consulting segment is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations. The operations of this segment provide a full range of human capital management services. These services are delivered predominantly to corporate clientele utilizing five major practices: employee benefits, compensation, management consulting, communications and human resources outsourcing.

consolidated financial statements included in Item 15(a). (2)In 2001, the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows exclude the impact of certain non-cash transfers primarily related to notes receivable from subsidiaries and notes payable to subsidiaries. (3)Investments in subsidiaries include approximately $3.2 billion invested in countries outside of the United States, primarily denominated in the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. (4)Guarantees and Indemnifications Aon provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others to allow Aon or others to complete a wide variety of business transactions. The maximum potential amount of future payments represent the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Aon does not currently anticipate making future payments to any of its subsidiaries, or third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries, for these guarantees and indemnifications. One of Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries holds a $95 million demand note receivable from another Aon subsidiary as of December 31, 2003. Aon has guaranteed the repayment of this note in the event that the obligated subsidiary is unable to make the principal payment, in whole or in part, when contractually due. Aon has unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of certain of its operating subsidiaries with respect to specific noncancelable operating leases. At December 31, 2003, future minimum payments (excluding sublease income) under these leases were approximately $45 million. These amounts are included in lease commitments, which are reflected in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Aon has provided indemnification under surety bonds issued by third parties of approximately $130 million as of December 31, 2003. The license, performance and other types of surety bonds are issued to permit operating subsidiaries of Aon to conduct business in various jurisdictions and to indemnify third parties for nonperformance by these subsidiaries. A bank provides overdraft facilities for certain of Aon's foreign subsidiaries. Aon has guaranteed repayment of this facility in the unlikely event that the foreign subsidiaries are unable to repay. Aon has also issued guarantees and/or other letters of support for various bank lines, and various other credit facilities for certain of its foreign operations (including Euro credit facility discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). Aon's maximum potential liability with regard to these exposures was $55 million at December 31, 2003. Aon has guaranteed the contractual performance of certain subsidiaries of third-party outsourcing agreements, which extend through 2009. However, in no case can the cumulative amount of these guarantees exceed $50 million. Aon has guaranteed the obligations of one of its major Netherlands' subsidiaries through 2007. Management believes there is sufficient operating cash flow, liquidity and equity at this subsidiary to cover current obligations and future obligations as they come due. Aon expects that as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time. 125 SCHEDULE II Aon Corporation and Subsidiaries VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 Additions Description Balance at beginning of year Charged to cost and expenses Charged/ (credited) to other accounts Deductions (1) Balance at end of year (millions) Year ended December 31, 2003 Allowance for doubtful accounts (2) (deducted from insurance brokerage and consulting receivables) $ 79 $ 43 $ 9 $ (43 ) $ 88 Allowance for doubtful accounts (deducted from premiums and other) 98 2 — (1 ) 99 Year ended December 31, 2002 Allowance for doubtful accounts (2) (deducted from isnurance brokerage and consulting receivables) $ 93 $ 23 $ 2 $ (39 ) $ 79 Allowance for doubtful accounts (deducted from premium and other) 94 7 — (3 ) 98 Year ended December 31, 2001 Allowance for doubtful accounts (2) (deducted from insurance brokerage and consulting receivables) $ 88 $ 30 $ (2 ) $ (23 ) $ 93 Allowance for doubtful accounts (deducted from premiums and other) 4 90 — — 94 (1)Amounts deemed to be uncollectible.

The Registrant has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the Registrant's financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2003, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Registrant have concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Registrant in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There were no significant changes in the Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation. 130 PART III Item 10. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant. Information relating to directors of the Registrant, including its audit committee and audit committee financial expert, is set forth under the heading ""Election of Directors"" in the Registrant's Proxy Statement for the 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 21, 2004 (the ""Proxy Statement""), and such information is incorporated herein by reference from the Proxy Statement. Information concerning the executive officers of the Registrant is contained in Part I hereof, pursuant to General Instruction G(3) and Instruction 3 to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K. Also incorporated herein by reference is the information under the heading ""The Board of Directors — Corporate Governance — Audit Committee Financial Expert"" and the information under the heading ""The Board of Directors — Corporate Governance — Code of Ethics"" in the Proxy Statement. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") requires that each of our directors and executive officers, and any other person who owns more than ten percent of Aon's common stock, file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of Aon's common stock. Such directors, executive officers and stockholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of such reports. Based solely upon our review of these reports, as well as written representations to the effect that no such other reports were required to be filed, Aon believes that all such SEC filing requirements were met during 2003, except for the delayed initial filing of Form 3 for each of Michael G. Bungert and D.P.M. Verbeek in connection with his designation as a Section 16 reporting officer of Aon. Item 11. Executive Compensation. Information relating to the Registrant's executive officer and director compensation is set forth under the headings ""Compensation of the Board of Directors,"" ""Executive Compensation,"" ""Aggregated Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year and Fiscal Year-End Option Values,"" ""Option Grants in 2003 Fiscal Year"" and ""Pension Plan Table"" of the Proxy Statement, and all such information is incorporated herein by reference from the Proxy Statement. 131 Item 12.

Below are the material features of our equity compensation plans that have not been approved by stockholders: (5)Aon UK Sharesave Scheme The Aon UK Sharesave Scheme (the ""UK Scheme"") is available solely to employees in the United Kingdom. Under the UK Scheme, employees authorize Aon to deduct a specified amount from compensation each pay period for deposit into a savings account for a three-year term. If a participant's deductions continue through the last day of the term, the participant is credited with a tax-free cash bonus equal to 2.75 times the monthly payroll deduction. Participants may cease participation in the UK Scheme at any time. Participants are also granted options at the beginning of each savings period and may direct Aon to purchase or issue shares of Aon common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market value at the beginning of the period, utilizing the accumulated amounts in their account. Options may be exercised generally within six months after the last day of the term, or after death, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement. If a participant ceases to be employed by Aon for other reasons, or declines to purchase Aon common stock during any of the available purchase periods, the participant's right to purchase shares of Aon common stock or accumulate additional payroll deductions lapses. The UK Scheme was approved by the Board of Directors in 1999. No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the UK Scheme has been made. As of December 31, 2003, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was zero. 132 Aon Australia Share Plans The Aon Australia Share Plans (the ""Australia Plans"") provide employees of Aon and participating subsidiaries employed in Australia who have at least 12 months of continuous service an opportunity to purchase Aon common stock at a 15% discount from the market price through payroll deductions. Under the Australia Plans, each year eligible employees choose whether they wish to participate in the Exempt Plan or the Deferred Plan. Under the Exempt Plan, participants contribute $850 per annum. Shares purchased under the Exempt Plan must be held for three years from the date of purchase. Under the Deferred Plan, participants contribute an elected amount between $2000 per annum and the lesser of 25% of salary and $30,000 per annum. Shares purchased under the Deferred Plan must be held for twelve months from the date of purchase. Participant contributions under both the Exempt Plan and the Deferred Plan are deducted ratably over all pay periods in the year and stock purchases are made for employees' accounts monthly on or about the 19th of the month. The Australia Plans commenced on June 1, 2002. No specific share authorization for the Australian Plans has been made. As of December 31, 2003, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was zero. Canada Share Save Plan The Canada Share Save Plan (""CSSP"") is one of the optional benefits under the Aon Flex program. Contributions to the CSSP are made through payroll deduction. The contributions are invested in Aon stock. As of December 31, 2003, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was zero. Aon MacDonagh Boland Group Limited Savings Related Share Option Scheme The Aon MacDonagh Boland Group Limited Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the ""Ireland Scheme"") is a save-as-you-earn employee stock purchase plan available solely to employees of Aon and participating subsidiaries employed in Ireland. Under the Ireland Scheme, eligible employees may sign a savings contract with Aon and a local bank authorizing Aon to deduct a specified amount from their compensation each pay period and deposit the deductions into a savings account for their benefit. Each savings contract has a three year term, and the last date of such term is defined as the ""Bonus Date."" If a participant's payroll deductions continue through the Bonus Date, the bank holding the savings contract pays the participant a tax-free cash bonus based on the amount of the participant's monthly payroll deductions. The bonus is equal to 2.0 times the monthly payroll deduction, which equates to an interest rate of 3.51% per year. Participants may cease participation in the Ireland Scheme and/or withdraw accumulated payroll deductions at any time; however, the participant would not be eligible to receive a bonus on withdrawn amounts and may be subject to taxes on amounts withdrawn prior to the Bonus Date. The Ireland Scheme was approved by the Board of Directors in 2000, but has not yet been implemented. No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the Ireland Scheme has been made. As of December 31, 2003, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was zero. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Netherlands) The Netherlands Employee Stock Purchase Plan provide employees of Aon and participating subsidiaries in the Netherlands the opportunity to purchase Aon common stock at a 15% discount. Contributions to this plan are made through payroll deduction. The maximum amount is not more than 15% of gross annual income with a maximum of US $10,000. As of December 31, 2003, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was 1,428. Aon Supplemental Savings Plan The Aon Supplemental Savings Plan (the ""ASSP"") was adopted by the Board of Directors in 1998. It is a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provides benefits to participants in the Aon Savings Plan whose employer matching gift contributions are limited because of IRS- imposed restrictions. Prior to January 1, 2004, participants covered under the ASSP are credited with the additional matching contributions they would have received under the Aon Savings Plan—100% of the first 1% to 3% of compensation (the First Tier Match) and 75% of the next 4% to 6% of compensation (the Second Tier Match)—had compensation up to $500,000 been considered. Participants in the ASSP may elect to have Tier I allocations credited to their accounts as if invested in a money market account or as if invested in Aon common stock. Tier II allocations are maintained in an Aon common stock account unless the participant is age 55 or more. If so, the participant may elect to direct his or her allocation to the money market account. Amounts maintained in the Aon common stock account may not be moved to the money market account, regardless of the participant's age. Before the beginning of each plan year, an election may be made by any participant to transfer some or all of a participant's money market account to the Aon common stock account. All amounts credited to the Aon common stock account are credited with dividends. Payments from the Aon common stock account are made only in shares of Aon common stock. Payments from the money market account are made in cash. Payments may be made in single sum or up to ten annual installments. No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the ASSP has been made. Aon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan The Aon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan was a plan established in 1989 as a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provided benefits to participants in the Aon Employee Stock Ownership Plan whose employer contributions were limited because of IRS-imposed restrictions. As of 1998, no additional amounts have been credited to participant accounts, although account balances are maintained for participants, and credited with dividends, until 133 distribution is required under the plan. Distributions are made solely in Aon common stock. No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the plan has been made. (6)The weighted-average exercise price of such shares is uncertain and is not included in this column. (7)None of these equity compensation plans contains a limit on the number of shares that may be issued under such plans; however, these plans are subject to the limitations set forth in the descriptions of these plans contained in footnote 5 above.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Liquidity Cash Flows Financial Condition Investments Borrowings Stockholders' Equity Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 22 OVERVIEW Key Drivers of Financial Performance Segments The key drivers of financial performance vary among our segments. Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services. Brokerage segment results are affected by a number of key drivers, including (i) conditions in insurance markets generally (particularly fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies), (ii) success in attracting new clients and avoiding loss of existing clients, (iii) managing our expenses, (iv) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and (v) interest income on our investments. In addition, in 2004, this segment was substantially affected by the matters discussed under ""Key Recent Events—Investigation by the New York Attorney General (AG) and Other Regulatory Authorities"" and our related decision to terminate contingent commission arrangements. In connection with the elimination of contingent commission arrangements, we are in the process of establishing a new business compensation model. Consulting. Consulting segment results are principally affected by (i) the employment levels of our clients that are mainly driven by economic conditions, (ii) governmental regulations affecting the health care market, employee benefit programs, and our clients' respective industries, (iii) success in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients, (iv) our success in cross selling services among business units, and (v) managing our overall level of expenses. In addition, in 2004, this segment was also affected by the matters discussed under ""Key Recent Events—Investigation by the New York Attorney General and Other Regulatory Authorities"" and our related decision to terminate contingent commission arrangements. Insurance Underwriting. Underwriting segment revenues are affected by (i) consumer buying habits that are influenced by economic conditions, (ii) our assumption of select commercial property and casualty insurance business particularly from our managing underwriting group in our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, (iii) competition with other underwriters (including competition based upon claims-paying ratings), (iv) success in selling new policies, selling existing policyholders more services, and having customers renew their policies, (v) the effectiveness and collectability of our reinsurance contracts, particularly in programs where we serve as the fronting company, ceding substantially all risk, and (vi) investment results. Corporate and Other. The key drivers of results in this segment are investment income and debt financing costs. Liquidity Liquidity is derived from cash flows from our business, excluding funds held on behalf of clients, and from financing. We use liquidity for capital expenditures, to repay debt, to fund acquisitions and pension obligations, and to pay dividends to our stockholders. Because we are a holding company, our subsidiaries may not have available cash to pay us dividends (which, in the case of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries, is limited by regulatory and rating agency considerations). Tax considerations may affect access to cash generated from operations outside the United States, as can pension funding requirements in both our domestic and international pension plans. Executive Summary of 2004 Financial Results We are proud of the high quality of our products and services, the breadth and depth of our intellectual capital, and the leading market positions that we have built. In 2004, consolidated revenues from continuing operations increased 5% to $10.2 billion, mainly due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Our organic revenue growth (which adjusts revenue growth for the effects of foreign exchange and other factors) was flat for the year. 23 Our income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest fell $251 million from 2003. The decrease in income was primarily from our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, as well as an increase in interest expense of $58 million due to the adoption at December 31, 2003 of FIN 46. Several factors that hurt our 2004 results included: •a $180 million provision for settlements with the New York AG and other regulatory authorities and a $40 million provision for costs and payments to settle the Daniel class action lawsuit, •increased net periodic pension expense related to our major defined benefit pension plans of $47 million, which primarily affected our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, •lost contingent commission revenue of approximately $47 million in 2004 due to the termination of these arrangements as of October 1, 2004, and •an $80 million unrealized investment gain recognized in earnings in 2003 relating to our warrants in Endurance Specialty Holdings, Inc. (""Endurance""). The value of these warrants in 2004 remained consistent with the December 31, 2003 value. Partially offsetting the absence of an unrealized gain on the warrants in 2004 were realized gains of $48 million from the sale of most of our common stock investment in Endurance. We are working to improve our margins by seeking organic revenue growth and greater financial discipline. More specifically, we are: •working to prudently manage employee compensation and benefit expenses; •in light of our terminating contingent commission arrangements, working with our clients, insurance carriers, regulators and others to establish a new business model that will ensure that we are properly compensated, while maintaining transparency and the trust of our clients; •reviewing strategic alternatives for our various businesses. During 2004, we sold our U.S. and U.K. claims businesses, as well as other small operations; •leveraging our purchasing power with vendors, suppliers, and landlords; •pursuing alternative resourcing strategies, such as outsourcing, to more efficiently provide non-client-facing services. In third quarter 2004, we began outsourcing most of our U.S. information technology infrastructure to Computer Sciences Corporation. Over the seven-year agreement, we expect to realize approximately $300 million of aggregate savings beginning in the second half of 2005 from outsourcing and consolidating data centers and other functions; and •offering additional services to existing clients who can benefit from our wide range of resources. We continue to do a better job of generating and managing our cash. More specifically, we: •grew our cash and investment balances. Our cash balance increased $30 million and our total investment balance increased $1.3 billion; •paid down $46 million of total debt in 2004. We paid down $305 million of domestic long-term debt that was scheduled to be redeemed this year. That decrease was mostly offset by an increase in borrowings at our foreign subsidiaries. We drew down $334 million on our long-term Euro credit facility to ensure adequate liquidity in the fourth quarter of 2004. Our debt and preferred stock to total capital percentage declined from 32.8% at December 31, 2003 to 29.8% at December 31, 2004; and •reduced capital expenditure spending by $105 million or 57% from 2003. All of Aon's financial information reflects the application of critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments, as discussed below under ""Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates."" Further discussion of these items may be found in the remainder of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. 24 KEY RECENT EVENTS Investigation by the New York Attorney General and Other Regulatory Authorities The insurance industry has recently come under significant scrutiny by various regulatory authorities. In April 2004, the New York AG began investigating various insurance industry practices, including placement service agreements, market service agreements, and similar agreements under which insurance carriers pay compensation to insurance brokers, including Aon, beyond standard commissions. The New York AG issued subpoenas to various companies in the insurance industry, including Aon, related to these agreements and various other practices, including alleged tying of reinsurance, bid rigging, and soliciting fictitious quotes. Other state attorneys general and state departments of insurance have also issued subpoenas to Aon or begun investigations into contingent commissions and other business practices of brokers, agents and insurers, and some state regulators have announced that they intend to enact new regulations or policies to govern these practices. Contingent commissions generally are non-service-specific, volume- or profit-based compensation arrangements between insurers and brokers. Similarly, regulatory authorities in other countries are either considering or have already begun similar inquiries. Aon is fully cooperating with all the investigations, and has retained outside counsel to conduct its own internal review of its compensation and other practices. In October 2004, the New York AG filed a complaint against Marsh & McLennan Company, Inc., and its subsidiary, Marsh Inc., alleging that Marsh committed fraud and violated New York State antitrust and securities' laws. On October 15, 2004, Marsh announced that it was suspending the use of contingent commission agreements. On October 22, 2004, we announced that we were terminating contingent commission arrangements with underwriters. We have nearly completed this process and are working with clients, insurance carriers, regulators, and others to establish a new business model that ensures that we link compensation to specific, measurable services in a way that is transparent, easy to understand, and accepted by clients. Other insurance brokers and carriers have also announced that they will terminate contingent commission arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we earned approximately $132 million of contingent commissions versus $169 million in 2003. Of the $132 million contingent commissions earned in 2004: •$111 million was included in our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and •$21 million was included in our Consulting segment. We earned $15 million of contingent commissions in fourth quarter 2004 versus $52 million in 2003. The amount recorded in this year's fourth quarter represents amounts earned on arrangements covering periods prior to October 1, 2004. A small number of these arrangements call for the calculations to be performed on an annual basis. Some of these calculations occurred in the fourth quarter, and minimal amounts are likely to be recorded in 2005. Contingent commission revenue was $37 million lower in 2004 compared to 2003 as a direct result of terminating our contingent commission arrangements. However, we estimated $47 million of lost contingent commission revenue in 2004 that would have been earned had we not terminated these arrangements. The loss of revenues from these agreements will likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for 2005. As of December 31, 2004, we have approximately $50 million of net receivables recorded related to contingent commissions, which we believe we are entitled to and will collect. During 2004, we also earned approximately $143 million of other compensation for services to underwriters, all of which is included in our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. This other compensation encompasses activities such as affinity program management, managing general 25 underwriting, and wholesale brokerage where we act as the agent for carriers. In addition, this includes compensation for specific services as is customary in some markets outside the United States. On March 4, 2005, Aon Corporation (""Aon"") and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the ""Company"") entered into an agreement (the ""Settlement Agreement"") with the Attorney General of the State of New York, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Illinois Attorney General and the Director of the Division of Insurance, Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (collectively, the ""State Agencies"") to resolve all the issues related to investigations conducted by the State Agencies. The material terms of the Settlement Agreement are as follows: The Company will pay $190 million into a fund (the ""Fund"") to be distributed to certain eligible policyholder clients. These payments are in full satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Settlement Agreement and the State Agencies have agreed not to impose any other financial obligation or liability on the Company related to the lawsuits. No portion of the payments by the Company is considered a fine or penalty. The Company will make payments into the Fund as follows: •On or before September 1, 2005, the Company shall pay $76 million into the Fund. •On or before September 1, 2006, the Company shall pay $76 million into the Fund. •On or before September 1, 2007, the Company shall pay $38 million into the Fund. The Fund, plus interest, will be used to compensate the Company's eligible policyholder clients according to procedures set out in the Settlement Agreement. No amount paid to the Fund will be returned to Aon under any circumstances. On or before June 30, 2005, the Company will calculate, in accordance with a formula approved by the State Agencies, the amount that each policyholder client is eligible to receive from the Fund. Clients eligible to participate in the Fund are those U.S. clients that engaged the Company to place, renew, consult on or service insurance with inception or renewal dates between January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2004 (the ""Relevant Period"") where such placement, renewal, consultation or servicing resulted in contingent commissions or overrides recorded by Aon during the Relevant Period (the ""Eligible Policyholders""). On or before June 30, 2005, the Company must send a notice to each Eligible Policyholder setting forth, among other things, the amount it will be paid from the Fund if it elects to participate (a ""Participating Policyholder""). Participating Policyholders must tender a release of claims against the Company arising from acts, omissions, transactions or conduct that are the subject of the lawsuits. On November 30, 2005, September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2007, each Participating Policyholder shall receive from the Fund as much of that Participating Policyholder's aggregate share of the Fund as possible with the monies then available in the Fund. In the event that an Eligible Policyholder elects not to participate or otherwise does not respond by October 30, 2005 (a ""Non-Participating Policyholder""), that client's allocated share may be used by the Company to satisfy any pending or other claims asserted by clients relating to issues in the Settlement Agreement. In no event shall a distribution be made from the Fund to any other client until all Participating Policyholders have been paid, nor shall total payments to any Non-Participating Policyholder exceed 80% of that policyholder's original allocated share. If any funds remain in the Fund as of October 1, 2007 such funds shall be distributed pro rata to the Participating Policyholders by November 1, 2007. In no event shall any of the amounts paid into the Fund be used to pay attorneys' fees. 26 Within 60 days of the date of the Settlement Agreement, the Company shall commence the implementation of certain business reforms, including the following: •To accept only a specific fee to be paid by the client, a specific percentage commission on premium to be paid by an insurer set at the time of purchase, renewal, placement or servicing of an insurance policy, or a combination of both. •To fully disclose in plain, unambiguous written language commissions in either dollars or percentage amounts. •Not to accept any other valuable compensation or consideration from an insurer other than as stated above, including contingent compensation and any compensation or preference in connection with the selection of insurers from which to solicit bids for clients. •Not to request or accept from any insurer any false, fictitious or inflated quote, or quote that does not represent the insurer's best evaluation at the time of the minimum premium the insurer would require to bind the insurance coverage sought by the client. •Not to request or accept from any insurer any promise or commitment for the use of our services, including reinsurance brokerage, conditioned upon any arrangement to provide preferential treatment for any insurer. •Not to place, renew or service a client's business through a wholesale broker unless agreed to by the client after full disclosure of all the compensation to be received, any interest we may have in the wholesale broker, and any alternative to using the wholesaler broker. •To fully disclose to each client all quotes received in connection with coverage of the client's risk with all terms and, all commissions to be received for each quote, and to provide disclosure of and obtain clients written consent to all compensation arrangements. •To disclose to each client at the end of each year all compensation received during the preceding year from any insurer or third party in connection with the client's policy. •To implement company-wide written standards of conduct regarding compensation from insurers consistent with the terms of the settlement and institute appropriate training of employees, including business ethics, professional obligations, conflicts of interest, antitrust and trade practices compliance and record keeping. •To establish a Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors that will monitor our compliance with the standards of conduct regarding compensation. •To maintain a record of all complaints regarding compensation from any insurer, and provide such record to the Compliance Committee. •To file annual reports with New York and Illinois for five years. The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, seek or accept indemnification pursuant to any insurance policy or other reimbursement with respect to any amounts payable under the Settlement Agreement. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 21, Interest on Receivables and Payables, we have discounted the payment stream associated with the settlement and recorded the present value of the liability and corresponding expense of $180 million in our financial statements as of December 31, 2004. The discount was determined using our incremental borrowing rate. We have not discounted the payment due on September 1, 2005. The settlement was considered fully tax deductible and is not treated as a permanent difference in our tax calculation. 27 The difference between our agreed settlement amount of $190 million and the amount in our financial statements as of December 31, 2004 represents the discount. The discount will be amortized over the course of the payment timeframe resulting in an increase in expense. Reconciliation between cash paid and expense incurred (millions) Incurred expense Cash to be paid 2004 $ 180 $ — 2005 6 76 2006 3 76 2007 1 38 Total settlement cost $ 190 $ 190 Of the $180 million expensed in 2004, $153 million was allocated to the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and the remaining $27 million was allocated to the Consulting segment. In addition to the New York AG and other regulatory investigations, we are defending various client class action lawsuits. We have provided $40 million for costs and payments to settle the Daniel class action lawsuit. Of the $40 million recorded, $34 million was allocated to our Risk and Insurance Brokerage segment and the remaining $6 million was allocated to our Consulting segment. Investment in Endurance Common Stock and Warrants During 2004, we sold virtually all of our common stock investment in Endurance resulting in a $48 million pretax gain for the year ended December 31, 2004. We sold: •9.8 million shares at a net realized price of $32.70 per share, resulting in proceeds of $320 million during fourth quarter 2004 and •1.4 million shares at a net realized price of $33.20 per share, resulting in proceeds of $47 million during first quarter 2004. We invested all the proceeds in short-term investments that are held by our insurance underwriting subsidiaries. We retain 4.1 million stock purchase warrants in Endurance. These warrants meet the definition of a derivative as described in FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires them to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Through December 31, 2002, these warrants were carried at zero value, which approximated their original cost. In 2003, Endurance completed its initial public offering, which provided a market value for the underlying shares and removed much of the uncertainty about the fair value of Endurance and the warrants. At December 31, 2004, we determined that the warrants had a fair value of approximately $80 million, consistent with the valuation as of December 31, 2003. We recognized these changes in value in investment income in the Corporate and Other segment. For the year ended December 31, 2004 the total change was immaterial. The future value of the warrants may vary considerably from the value at December 31, 2004, due to the price movement of the underlying shares, the passage of time, and changes in other factors used in the valuation model (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the valuation of the warrants). Sale of Certain Businesses During 2003 and 2004, we sold certain businesses, including our: •automotive finance servicing business, which had been in run-off since first quarter 2001, 28 •U.K. claims services businesses, •a small non-core consulting subsidiary, •U.K. reinsurance brokerage runoff unit, and •a small U.S. brokerage unit. The operating results of all of these businesses are classified as discontinued operations, and prior year's operating results have been reclassified to discontinued operations, as this table shows: (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 33 $ 105 $ 106 Pretax loss: Operations $ (20 ) $ (53 ) $ (47 ) Revaluation (23 ) (23 ) — Total $ (43 ) $ (76 ) $ (47 ) After-tax loss: Operations $ (13 ) $ (34 ) $ (30 ) Revaluation (18 ) (14 ) — Total $ (31 ) $ (48 ) $ (30 ) See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, ""Disposal of Operations,"" for further information. In November 2004, we sold our Cambridge Integrated Services Group, Inc. (""Cambridge"") claims administration business to Scandent Holdings Mauritius Limited (SHM) for $90 million in cash plus convertible preferred stock in SHM, valued at $15 million. Because of our convertible preferred stock holding and other factors, we included Cambridge's results prior to the sale's effective date, as well as a pretax gain on the sale of approximately $15 million, in income from continuing operations. From time to time, we explore strategic alternatives for our various businesses. In February 2005, we announced that we are exploring alternatives relating to our ownership of Swett & Crawford, which is currently the largest U.S.-based wholesale insurance broker with more than 900 employees in 40 offices. By exploring alternatives, we expect to determine if Swett & Crawford's potential can be realized more fully under different ownership. No decision has been made to sell Swett & Crawford at this time. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Aon's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To prepare these financial statements, we made estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect: •what we report as our assets and liabilities, •what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and •the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. In accordance with our policies, we: •regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those concerning revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, policy liabilities (including future policy benefit reserves, unearned premium reserves and policy and contract claim reserves), restructuring costs, retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation, and •base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. 29 The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements. Pensions U.S. Plans Effective January 1, 2004, the U.S. pension plans were closed to new employees. All new employees participate in a defined contribution plan. Over time, this change will reduce the volatility inherent in the accounting for the U.S. pension plans. Aon uses a market-related valuation of assets to calculate pension expense. This valuation reflects a five-year average of the difference between the expected return on plan assets and the actual market value return. The prior year market-related value is projected to the current date by adjusting for contributions, benefit payments and expected returns. The asset gain or loss is the difference between the expected return on assets and the actual return on assets. Twenty percent of the asset gain or loss is recognized in the current year's market-related value, with the remaining eighty percent spread evenly over the next four years. As of year-end 2004, the market-related value of assets does not yet reflect our accumulated asset losses of $142 million. These losses will increase pension expense as they are graded into the market-related asset value and may be offset by future asset gains. As of year-end 2004, we reported a fair value of pension assets of $969 million, while the market-related value of assets is $1,111 million. Under FASB Statement No. 87, the full gain or loss on assets and obligations is not recorded as expense in the current period. Statement No. 87 allows changes in the projected benefit obligation and market value of assets to be deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense over several years, based on the average expected future service of active employees, which is currently nine years. Gains and losses on pension obligations include the net effects of changes in the discount rate as well as demographic changes in the employee data. For the 2004 valuation year, the pension plans have a combined deferred loss of $584 million (comprised of unrecognized asset losses of $142 million and other than deferred asset losses of $442 million) that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements. We amortize the other than deferred asset losses of $442 million outside of a corridor, over about nine years; this corridor is defined as 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation. For 2005, the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is projected to be $34 million. To the extent not offset by future gains, the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized. The pension plan investment policy allows assets to be allocated to various asset classes. According to the policy, the percentage of total assets invested in each class should fall within a range. There is a target allocation for long-term investment decisions. However, the range provides flexibility to accommodate prevailing market conditions. In order to determine the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan, we analyze the historical performance, investment community forecasts, and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the plan's asset classes. In setting the individual asset assumptions, we weight the historical performance data series most heavily toward the geometric average returns. We then weight the expected returns for each asset class by the plan's target allocation. To determine pension expense, we currently assume a long-term rate of return of 8.5%. 30 This table shows the result of the calculation based on the target asset allocation for year-end 2004. The actual return for the 2004 valuation year (10.5%) was in excess of the assumed return. Asset Class Allocation Range Target Allocation Historical Returns Weighted Average Expected Rate of Return Equities 50 – 80 % 70% Domestic Equities 40 – 70 40 10.0 % 4.0 % Limited Partnerships and Other 2.5 – 20 10 11.3 1.1 International Equities 5 – 15 10 10.4 1.0 Real Estate and REITs 5 – 15 10 8.8 0.9 Aon Common Stock 0 – 5 No Target 10.0 — Debt Securities 20 – 50 30 Fixed Maturities 20 – 50 30 6.0 1.8 Invested Cash 0 – 2 No Target 3.1 — Total 8.8 % There are several assumptions that impact the actuarial calculation of pension obligations and, in turn, net periodic pension expense in accordance with Statement No. 87. These assumptions require various degrees of judgment. The most significant assumptions are: •the expected return on plan assets and •the discount rate. The same assumptions are used for our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans where applicable. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense. For example, holding all other assumptions constant, a one percentage point: •decrease in our estimated discount rate would increase our estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $38 million and the estimated 2005 postretirement medical benefit expense by $0.5 million and •increase in our estimated discount rate would decrease the 2005 estimated pension expense by approximately $31 million and the postretirement medical benefit expense by approximately $0.5 million. Similarly, holding other assumptions constant, a one percentage point: •decrease in our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $11 million and •increase in the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would decrease pension expense by approximately $11 million. Required cash contributions are also sensitive to assumptions, however the assumptions used to determine contributions to the plan are changed infrequently. We anticipate cash funding requirements of $47 million in 2005 and $100 million in 2006. Major U.K. Plans During 1999, the U.K. pension plans were closed to new employees, and all new employees became participants in a defined contribution plan. As with the U.S. plans, this change will gradually reduce the volatility of the accounting for U.K. pension plans. As with our other international plans, the U.K. plans are solely obligations of subsidiaries of Aon Corporation. 31 For the 2004 valuation year, the major U.K. pension plans have a combined deferred loss (from asset and liability experience) of $1,500 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements. We amortize the accumulated loss outside of a corridor over 17 years; this corridor is defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation. For 2005, the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is $67 million. To the extent not offset by future gains, the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized. To determine pension expense, we use the fair market value of plan assets. Generally, the trustees of the U.K. plans determine the investment policy for each plan. In total, at the end of the 2004 valuation year, the plans were invested 66% in equities and 34% in fixed income securities with a fair value of $2,355 million. In determining the expected rate of return, investment community forecasts and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. Consideration is given to historic performance data over long periods in order to check the assumption in each class relative to each other. The expected returns for each asset class are then weighted by the actual asset allocation of the plans. To determine pension expense, we currently assume a long-term rate of return of 7.25%. This table shows the result of the calculation based on the actual asset allocation for year-end 2004. The actual return for the 2004 valuation year (8.2%) was in excess of the assumed return. Asset Class Allocation Range Target Allocation Historical Returns Weighted Average Expected Rate of Return Equities 45 – 75 % 65% UK Equities 30 – 50 39 8.5 % 3.3 % Non-UK Equities 10 – 25 22 8.5 1.9 Real Estate 0 – 10 4 8.0 0.3 Debt Securities 25 – 55 35 Fixed Maturities 25 – 55 35 5.2 1.8 Invested Cash 0 0 3.5 — Total 7.3 % With respect to U.K. pension liabilities, a one-percentage point: •decrease in our estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $51 million and •increase in our estimated discount rate would decrease the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $48 million. Similarly, a one-percentage point: •decrease in our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $23 million and •increase in our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would decrease estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $23 million. Cash flow requirements are also sensitive to assumptions, however the assumptions used for funding the U.K. plans are changed infrequently. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate U.K. funding requirements of $152 million in both 2005 and 2006. These contributions reflect minimum funding requirements plus other amounts agreed to with the trustees of the U.K. plans. 32 Dutch Plan To determine pension expense, we use the fair market value of plan assets that, at year-end 2004, amounted to $363 million. At the end of 2004, the Dutch pension plan has a combined deferred loss of $135 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements. We amortize the accumulated loss outside of a corridor over 20 years; this corridor is defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation. For 2005, the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is $5 million. To the extent not offset by future gains, the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized. The target asset allocation is 35% equities and 65% fixed income securities, with an allowed deviation of 5%. At year-end 2004, the actual asset allocation was consistent with the target allocation. The expected long-term rate of return is 6%, which results from an expected future return of 8% on equities and a 5% return on fixed income investments. With respect to Dutch pension liabilities, a one percentage point: •decrease in our estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $6 million and •increase in our estimated discount rate would decrease the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $5 million. A one percentage point: •decrease in our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $4 million and •increase in our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would decrease the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $4 million. At year-end 2004, the Dutch pension plan had a prepaid pension asset of $121 million. In the future, if the funded status of the plan deteriorates, this amount could be reflected in a minimum pension liability, which would reduce stockholders' equity. The Company accelerated a planned 2005 contribution of approximately $18 million into the pension plan before December 31, 2004. Contingencies We define a contingency as any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved. Under GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual issue. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue, or changes in approach, such as changing our settlement strategy. We have reflected the impact of the March 2005 New York AG and other regulatory authorities settlement in our December 31, 2004 financial statements. The settlement amount is fixed and determinable, therefore the liability was discounted to the net present value of the payments based on our incremental borrowing rate in accordance with APB 21. The $10 million difference between the settlement amount of $190 million and the $180 million liability recorded in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 represents the discount. This discount will increase our expenses in future years as it is amortized into expense. 33 In addition to the New York AG and other regulatory authorities settlement accrual, we have also accrued $40 million for costs and payments to settle the Daniel class action lawsuit. Policy Liabilities Through our insurance underwriting operations, we collect premiums from policyholders, and we establish liabilities (reserves) to pay benefits to policyholders. The liabilities for policy benefits, claims, and unearned premiums are a large portion of the total policy liabilities shown on our balance sheet, and are comprised primarily of estimated future payments to policyholders, policy and contract claims, and unearned and advance premiums and contract fees. Accident, Health & Life To establish policy liabilities, we develop estimates of reported and anticipated claims, based on our historical experience, other actuarial data, and assumptions on investment yields. We base interest rate assumptions on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Although mortality, morbidity, persistency, and interest rate assumptions are set when we issue new insurance policies, we may need to provide for additional losses on a product by increasing reserves, reducing previously capitalized acquisition costs established for that product, or by establishing premium deficiency reserves if there are significant changes in our experience or assumptions. The process of estimating and establishing policy and contract liabilities is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. Liabilities for incurred but unpaid claims include estimated costs relating to incurred and reported claims and incurred but not reported claims. The liability for unpaid claims is based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims using best estimates of past experience. These estimates reflect known current trends and any other factors that would influence historical data. Actual experience may vary from anticipated levels due to changes in claim reporting, processing patterns and variations from historic averages for the amount paid per claim. Variations from historic patterns and averages could result in additional changes that increase or decrease unpaid claim liabilities. As of December 31, 2004, there were no known changes in reporting or processing patterns. Except for products that meet the definition of FASB Statement No. 97 Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments, the liability for future policy benefits relating to long-duration contracts is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders less the present value of future premiums, and is estimated using methods that include assumptions such as estimates of expected investment yields, mortality, morbidity, and policy persistency. Emerging trends in morbidity, mortality, persistency, and asset yields may cause the actual experience to vary from original estimates. The financial impacts of changes from original assumptions are taken into account as the actual experience is realized. Some of these trends can fluctuate significantly over time. To the extent that current estimates of the present value of future benefits exceed the present value of future premiums for a product line, all excess amounts have been taken into account as a loss. There are no current estimates of the overall net gain resulting from improvements from original assumptions. Long-duration contracts that meet the definition of Statement No. 97, such as universal life type products are accounted for in a manner consistent with the accounting for interest-bearing or other financial instruments. Payments received on those contracts are not reported as revenue and a corresponding policy benefit reserve is not established. The liability for policy benefits is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of policyholders at the date of the financial statements, amounts that have been assessed to compensate the insurer for services to be performed over future periods, 34 and amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract. Claim Liability (millions) Reserves for claim liabilities as of the year ended were as follows: December 31, 2004 $ 422 December 31, 2003 $ 447 December 31, 2002 $ 421 A 1% increase in the assumed medical cost trends would reduce pretax income by approximately $1.8 million. Future Policy Benefits (millions) Reserves for future policy benefits as of the year ended were as follows: December 31, 2004 $ 1,542 December 31, 2003 $ 1,396 December 31, 2002 $ 1,310 If a 1% unfavorable change were to occur in the mortality and morbidity assumptions for both the accident & health and life books of business, pretax income would be decreased by approximately $7 million. Warranty Our warranty business is unique in comparison to traditional underwriting businesses in that we are providing warranties for consumer goods and credit. These programs are generally reviewed by policy period to determine the necessary reserves for warranty claims. For automobile warranty, terms may extend as far as seven years with a few warranties lasting longer. Other warranty lines have terms extending up ten years with a few warranties lasting longer. In addition to the term of the warranty, other characteristics are taken into account when estimating the reserves. Considerations such as the manufacturer or classes of products are reviewed and embedded in our calculation methodology. Similar to other underwriting activities, historic loss development factors are used to project the ultimate loss. For recent periods we use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. This method is commonly used in underwriting businesses. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method combines loss development methods with an expected loss ratio technique. The expected loss ratio is computed using either judgment, recent experience, or other commonly used statistical methods such as the Cape Cod method. These methods result in a point estimate of our liability, which was $822 million as of December 31, 2004. We believe that the ultimate development of the recorded liability could be as much as 10% more or 5% less. Sources of uncertainty include technological innovations such as plasma TVs and liquid crystal displays. In addition, some of our policies include profit sharing where the client participates in underwriting profits but we pay all underwriting losses. 35 Property & Casualty The loss reserve estimates for all property and casualty lines of business are derived by accident year from a minimum of five standard actuarial techniques including, but not limited to, incurred and paid loss development factors based on both program history and industry development patterns for similar lines of business. A Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method is also employed incorporating historical loss ratio performance weighted with case emergence to date. Where such data is available, frequency and severity methods are used taking into account claim count emergence and severity trends. The selected ultimate loss estimates are based on the range of estimates discussed above. A typical selection is the average of the estimates, but that selection may also be influenced by the consistency of the estimates, knowledge of emerging loss trends, and rate or benefit changes. Selected ultimate losses are evaluated for business on a direct, assumed, ceded and net basis. From the selected ultimate losses, paid losses are deducted to arrive at the total reserve. The total reserve includes case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves. At December 31, 2004, our recorded liability was $277 million. Given the current knowledge of the overall variability of property and casualty exposures, loss reserves are expected to fall within 10 loss ratio points (or approximately $20 million) of our selected estimate 95% of the time. Valuation of Investments We periodically review securities with material unrealized losses and evaluate them for other than temporary impairment. We analyze various risk factors and determine if any specific asset impairment exists. If there is a specific asset impairment, we recognize a realized loss and adjust the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value. We review invested assets with material unrealized losses each quarter. Those assets are separated into two categories: (1)Assets with unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events, which are segmented among four categories: fixed-maturity investments; publicly-traded preferred stocks; publicly-traded common stocks; and private common and preferred stocks and other invested assets. (2)Assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events. Assets with unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events Fixed maturity investments. At least quarterly, we: •review the creditworthiness of corporate obligors for changes by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and changes in fundamental financial performance of the underlying entity, •monitor cash flow trends and underlying levels of collateral for asset-backed securities, and •evaluate all bonds and asset-backed securities whose financial performance has declined for other than temporary impairment. Publicly-traded preferred stocks. We review issuer creditworthiness at least quarterly. Creditworthiness factors reviewed include nationally recognized credit rating agency rating changes and changes in financial performance of the underlying issuer. We monitor all preferred stock investments with declining financial performance for other-than-temporary impairment. Publicly-traded common stocks. Quarterly, we review each common stock investment to determine if its decline in value is deemed other-than-temporary. Our review includes an analysis of issuer 36 financial trends, and market expectations based on third-party forward-looking analytical reports, when available. Private common and preferred stocks and other invested assets. We review quarterly private issue valuations, which include recent transaction valuations between the issuer and a third party; financial performance reviews; and financial trend comparisons with publicly-traded companies in the same or similar industries. We recognize an other-than-temporary impairment loss when appropriate for these investments with continuous material unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events. This decision is based upon the facts and circumstances for each investment. Assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events Invested assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events include those negatively impacted by increasing U.S. Treasury or local sovereign interest rates; corporate and asset-backed credit spread widening; common stock price volatility due to conditions in the overall market or a particular industry; and illiquid market conditions. Under some conditions, it is assumed that a decline in value below cost is temporary. This assumption is made for fixed-maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events when the market is expected to recover, and we have the intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or the market recovers, which is a decisive factor when considering an impairment loss. If the decision that holding the investment is no longer appropriate, we will reevaluate that investment for other-than-temporary impairment. An evaluation is made for other-than-temporary impairment for preferred and common stock and other investments with continuous material unrealized losses for two consecutive quarters due to market conditions or industry-related events. An other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized based upon each investment's facts and circumstances. We continue to monitor these securities quarterly to ensure that unrealized losses are not the result of issuer-specific events. Intangible Assets Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses. 37 We: •classify our intangible assets as either goodwill, client lists, non-compete agreements, future profits of purchased books of business of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries, or other purchased intangibles; •allocate intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and determine estimated useful lives based on our internal valuations or valuations from qualified independent appraisers. We base the calculations of these amounts on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods. Different estimates or assumptions could produce different results; •amortize intangible assets other than goodwill over their estimated useful lives, while goodwill is not subject to amortization; and •carry intangible assets at cost, less accumulated amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Impairment reviews are performed at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we would complete further analysis to determine whether there was an impairment loss. No further analysis was required in 2004 or 2003. We base our determinations of fair value on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates. Different estimates or assumptions could produce different results. We included the estimated effects of the regulatory investigations and the termination of contingent commission arrangements in our 2004 impairment test. In March 2005 we re-evaluated the results of our annual impairment review due to the subsequent developments on the matters described in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and concluded that our initial conclusions remain appropriate and that no impairment loss is required. REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS General In the discussion of operating results we sometimes refer to supplemental information extracted from consolidated financial information, which U.S. GAAP does not require to be presented in the financial statements. Supplemental information related to organic revenue growth is information that helps Aon and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses, unusual items, and for the underwriting segment only, an adjustment between written and earned premium. Supplemental organic revenue growth information does not affect net income or any other GAAP reported figures. It should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our consolidated statements of income. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they do not make identical adjustments. Since Aon conducts business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties, the movements of foreign exchange rates are important to our business. In comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, management has isolated the impact of the change in 38 currencies between periods by providing percentage changes on a comparable currency basis for revenue, and has disclosed the effect on earnings per share. This form of reporting is intended to give financial statement users more meaningful information about our operations. Some tables in the segment discussions reconcile organic revenue growth percentages to the reported revenue growth percentages for the segments and sub-segments. We separately disclose the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures, and transfers of business units, which represent the most significant reconciling items. In an ""all other"" category, we total other reconciling items that are not generally significant individually or in the aggregate. If there is a significant individual reconciling item within the ""all other"" category, we provide additional disclosure in a footnote. Summary Results for 2002 through 2004 The consolidated results of continuing operations follow: (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenue: Brokerage commissions and fees $ 7,060 $ 6,797 $ 6,097 Premiums and other 2,788 2,609 2,368 Investment income 324 312 251 Total consolidated revenue 10,172 9,718 8,716 Expenses: General expenses 7,406 7,013 6,355 Benefits to policyholders 1,516 1,427 1,375 Interest expense 136 101 124 Amortization of intangible assets 54 60 51 Provision for New York and other state settlements 180 — — Unusual credits —World Trade Center — (14 ) (29 ) Total expenses 9,292 8,587 7,876 Income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest $ 880 $ 1,131 $ 840 Pretax margin — continuing operations 8.7 % 11.6 % 9.6 % Consolidated Results for 2004 Compared to 2003 Revenue In 2004, revenue increased $454 million or 5% over 2003 to $10.2 billion. The movement in foreign exchange rates caused a majority of this increase, as revenue increased $67 million excluding foreign exchange effects. We do not directly hedge revenues against foreign currency translation because it is not cost effective, but we do try to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on pretax income through other hedging strategies. Brokerage commissions and fees increased by $263 million or 4% from the prior year, driven almost entirely by favorable foreign exchange rates. There was no organic revenue growth in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment in large part due to the termination of contingent commission arrangements, as well as a softer insurance market. Consulting organic revenue grew 1%. Premiums and other increased $179 million or 7% from the prior year due to increased retentions, a change in an insurance program for a specialty accident and health line, and favorable foreign 39 exchange rates. Growth in specialty property and casualty and core accident, health, and life business was offset by a planned decrease in the runoff businesses. Investment income increased by 4% over 2003, and includes related investment expenses and income or loss on investment disposals and impairments. The net increase reflects improved results at the operating segments driven primarily by an increase in short-term rates, partially offset by a decline at Corporate. Consolidated revenue by geographic area follows: (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 % of Total 2003 % of Total 2002 % of Total Revenue by geographic area: United States $ 5,248 52 % $ 5,198 54 % $ 5,006 57 % United Kingdom 1,732 17 1,756 18 1,543 18 Continent of Europe 1,719 17 1,469 15 1,117 13 Rest of World 1,473 14 1,295 13 1,050 12 Total revenue $ 10,172 100 % $ 9,718 100 % $ 8,716 100 % U.S. consolidated revenue, which represents 52% of total revenue, increased $50 million or 1% in 2004 compared to 2003. The low revenue growth reflects the softer U.S. retail market that began late in 2003 after a two-year rapid increase in premiums following the September 11 tragedy and lower contingent commission revenue. Additionally, the November 2004 sale of Cambridge resulted in a $19 million loss of revenue in 2004 as compared to 2003. U.K. revenue decreased $24 million or 1%. Excluding the positive effects of foreign currency exchange, revenue decreased $198 million or 10%. The decrease in revenue is attributable to the soft market, which resulted in lower premiums and commissions. Additionally, the sale of our U.K. claims service business resulted in an $82 million loss of revenue in 2004 as compared to 2003. Continent of Europe revenue increased $250 million or 17% and Rest of World revenue increased $178 million or 14%, principally reflecting a weakening of the U.S. dollar. Expenses Total expenses increased $705 million or 8% over 2003. General expenses increased $393 million or 6% over 2003, reflecting the impact of: •foreign exchange rates, •increase in our net periodic pension expenses of $47 million for our major plans over 2003, and •a $40 million provision for costs and payments to settle the Daniel class action lawsuit. Net gains on currency derivative transactions reduced expenses by $45 million in 2004. The 6% increase in benefits to policyholders was driven by the combination of growth in underwriting revenue, the change in an insurance program for a specialty accident and health line, and foreign exchange rates. In 2003, expenses increased due to higher claims for National Program Services, Inc. (NPS) of $79 million (see the Consolidated Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 section below for more information). Interest expense increased $35 million or 35% primarily due to the adoption of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003, which required the deconsolidation of our trust preferred capital securities, and which was offset by an increase in notes payable. Interest expense on the notes payable was $58 million for 2004. Absent this item, interest expense declined $23 million due principally to a reduction in debt 40 levels during most of the year (see Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information). Included in our results is a $180 million provision for settlements resulting from investigations by the New York AG and other regulatory authorities. In 2003, total expenses included a $14 million credit related to the World Trade Center property insurance settlement. The 2003 credit represents a $60 million final settlement of our World Trade Center property insurance claim, net of $46 million paid to a third party relating to temporary office space secured in Manhattan after the World Trade Center was destroyed. Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax and Minority Interest Because the increase in expenses exceeded the increase in revenues (for the reasons described above), income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest decreased $251 million in 2004 to $880 million. Approximately 87% of Aon's 2004 consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest was from international operations. The $220 million provisions for settlements resulting from investigations by the New York AG and other regulatory authorities and for costs and payments to settle the Daniel class action lawsuit were considered domestic expenses. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 34.4% and 37% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Differences between the overall effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate are typically due to U.S. state income taxes and differentials between U.S. and international tax rates. Changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax income directly impact our effective tax rates. In 2004, a one-time tax benefit resulting from the difference between our tax and book basis in Cambridge reduced our effective tax rate. A summary of these effects is included in the rate reconciliation provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations decreased to $577 million ($1.72 per diluted share) from $676 million ($2.04 per diluted share) in 2003. Basic income per share from continuing operations was $1.80 and $2.12 for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Including the effect of currency hedges, the positive impact of foreign currency translation was approximately $0.18 per share. To compute income per share, we have deducted dividends paid on the redeemable preferred stock from net income. In accordance with Emerging Income Task Force (EITF) No. 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Investments on Diluted Earnings Per Share, diluted shares outstanding were increased by 14 million to reflect the possible conversion of Aon's 3.5% convertible debt securities. After-tax interest expense on these debt securities has been added back to income from continuing operations when calculating the diluted income per share. Discontinued Operations After-tax losses from discontinued operations in 2004 were $31 million ($0.10 and $0.09 per basic and diluted share, respectively). In comparison, after-tax losses in 2003 from discontinued operations were $48 million ($0.15 and $0.14 per basic and diluted share, respectively). Discontinued operations also include: •certain insurance underwriting subsidiaries acquired with Alexander and Alexander Services, Inc. (A&A), where we are paying off these subsidiaries' liabilities over several years, and 41 •payments related to A&A's indemnification of liabilities relating to subsidiaries sold by A&A before its acquisition by Aon. There was no material impact on the income statement from the A&A discontinued operations in 2004, 2003 or 2002. Based on current estimates, management believes that these A&A discontinued operations are adequately reserved. The net liability is included as a component of other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on discontinued operations). Consolidated Results for Fourth Quarter 2004 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2003 Total revenue in the quarter rose 3% to $2.7 billion. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue was even with last year. Organic growth declined 1% reflecting: •a softening insurance market, •lower contingent commission revenue of $37 million, and •$19 million in lower revenue from the sale of our U.S. Claims service business effective November 30, 2004. The sale of our U.S. and U.K. claims services businesses more than offset the positive impact of acquisitions made by our brokerage operations. Lower claims services revenue (in continuing operations) is primarily due to the sale of Cambridge. These shortfalls were partially offset by growth in international risk and insurance brokerage operations. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest decreased by $248 million or 69% from 2003. The significant decrease was influenced by: •a provision of $180 million for settlements resulting from the investigation by the New York AG and other regulatory authorities, •a $40 million provision for costs and payments to settle the Daniel class action lawsuit and •a credit in 2003 of $60 million, representing a final settlement for our overall World Trade Center property insurance claim. These were partially offset by: •a gain in 2004 of $37 million from the sale of virtually all of our remaining common stock investment in Endurance and •a charge in 2003 in the warranty, credit, and property and casualty sub-segment of $45 million for additional losses and reserve strengthening for the NPS run-off program (see description of NPS in the following section under expenses). Consolidated Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Revenue Total revenues were $9.7 billion, an increase of 11%. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 6% over the comparable period. This increase resulted from improvements in brokerage commissions and fees, premiums earned, and investment income. 42 Brokerage commissions and fees increased 11% to $6.8 billion as a result of: •growth in new business, •improved client retention rates for most of our businesses, •the weakening U.S. dollar, and •higher revenue from a large Consulting segment outsourcing contract begun in the third quarter 2002. Premiums and other, primarily related to insurance underwriting operations, improved to $2.6 billion, a 10% increase over 2002. The increase reflects growth in some warranty and credit programs, along with specialty property and casualty lines, and favorable foreign exchange rates. Investment income increased 24% over 2002, and includes related investment expenses and income or loss on investment disposals and impairments. The net increase reflects: •lower impairment write-downs in 2003 of $36 million compared with $130 million in 2002. 2002 impairment write-downs included a $51 million cumulative adjustment related to prior reporting periods, •a non-cash increase in the value of Endurance stock warrants of $80 million and equity earnings from our investment in Endurance common stock of $25 million. Equity earnings from our Endurance investment in 2003 and 2002 were $46 million and $21 million, respectively, •interest income in 2002 on a tax-related settlement of $48 million with no corresponding amount in 2003, and •lower investment income generated by the operating units of $85 million including $27 million on deposit-type contracts which reflected lower rates. U.S. revenues, which represent 54% of total revenue, increased 4% in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of growth driven: •primarily by new business development and improved retention rates in both retail and reinsurance brokerage and •secondarily by growth in the Consulting segment resulting from a large outsourcing contract that began in the third quarter 2002. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our Accident & Health and Life sub-segment that was primarily from transferring our U.S. large employer group life and accidental death business to a third party via an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. While moderating, commercial property and casualty premium rate increases for most lines of coverage continued in 2003. We generally benefit from increased premium rates through increased commissions, although higher premiums can cause clients to purchase lower policy limits and retain higher deductibles. Combined U.K. and Continent of Europe revenues increased 21% in 2003 to $3.2 billion and Rest of World revenue increased 23% to $1.3 billion, reflecting foreign exchange, strong new business, and the positive effect of increased premium rates. Expenses General expenses increased 10% over 2002 reflecting: •growth of the businesses, •the effect of foreign exchange rates, and 43 •higher overall defined benefit pension plan costs of $131 million for our major plans. General expenses in 2002 included $50 million of costs from the planned divestiture of the insurance underwriting segment and a credit of $6 million, reflecting the reversal of termination benefits that we incurred as part of our business transformation plan. Benefits to policyholders rose $52 million, or 4%, primarily as the result of new business volume, and losses and reserve strengthening of $65 million relating to NPS business, a non-core book of runoff business. NPS was hired to handle quoting, binding, premium collection, claims adjusting, and other servicing related to general liability insurance policies issued by one of Aon's subsidiaries. However, in mid-2002, we obtained a temporary restraining order against NPS, stopped it from initiating any new business on our behalf, and with others, sued the company for fraud. In 2003, actuaries examined the business that NPS had written and reviewed assumptions, such as historical loss development patterns and the expected ultimate loss ratio. As a result of this review, we strengthened our reserves, mainly for accident years 2001 and 2002. These reserves should cover future payments we expect to make in the next five to seven years. Excluding NPS, benefit payout ratios have declined, however, due to a shift in product mix. Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt levels. Amortization of intangible assets grew $9 million from 2002 due primarily to recent acquisitions as well as foreign exchange rates in the risk and insurance brokerage services segment. Total expenses also included a $14 million credit in 2003 and a $29 million credit in 2002 related to the World Trade Center. The 2003 credit represents a $60 million gain from a final settlement of our World Trade Center property insurance claim, net of $46 million related to the assignment to a third party of temporary office space we needed in Manhattan after the World Trade Center was destroyed. The 2002 credit represents a gain resulting from a settlement with our insurance carriers regarding reimbursement for depreciable assets that were destroyed. Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax and Minority Interest Income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest increased from $840 million in 2002 to $1.1 billion in 2003. This increase is due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange, the improvement in investment income ($61 million), and 2002 expenses related to the planned spin-off ($50 million) with no corresponding amount in 2003. Approximately 68% of Aon's 2003 consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest was from international operations. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 37% in both 2003 and 2002. The overall effective tax rates are higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily because of state income tax provisions. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations increased to $676 million ($2.04 per diluted share) from $496 million ($1.75 per diluted share) in 2002. Basic income per share from continuing operations was $2.12 and $1.76 for 2003 and 2002, respectively. In fourth quarter 2002, we had a common stock offering, which increased the number of average common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding. Including the effect of currency hedges, the positive impact of foreign currency translations was approximately $0.12 per share. We have deducted dividends paid for the redeemable preferred stock from net income to compute income per share. In accordance with EITF No. 04-8, 2003 diluted shares outstanding were increased by 14 million to reflect the possible conversion of Aon's 3.5% 44 convertible debt securities. After-tax interest expense on these debt securities has been added back to income from continuing operations when calculating the diluted income per share. Discontinued Operations After-tax losses from our discontinued businesses in 2003 were $48 million ($0.15 and $0.14 per basic and diluted share, respectively). In comparison, losses in 2002 from these discontinued operations were $30 million ($0.11 per both basic and diluted share). The 2003 results include an after-tax loss on the revaluation of the automotive finance business of $14 million. REVIEW BY SEGMENT General Aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services, Consulting, and Insurance Underwriting (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information). Aon's operating segments are identified as those that: •report separate financial information and •are evaluated regularly when we are deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We attribute revenues to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues. Segment revenue includes investment income generated by invested assets of that segment, as well as the impact of related derivatives. Investment characteristics mirror liability characteristics of the respective segments: •Our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting businesses invest funds held on behalf of clients and operating funds in short-term obligations. •In Insurance Underwriting, policyholder claims and other types of non-interest sensitive insurance liabilities are primarily supported by intermediate to long-term fixed-maturity instruments. Investments underlying interest-sensitive capital accumulation insurance liabilities are fixed- or floating-rate fixed-maturity obligations. For this business segment, operating invested assets are approximately equal to average net policy liabilities. •Our insurance subsidiaries also have invested assets that exceed net policy liabilities which allow us to maintain solid claims paying ratings. Income from these investments are reflected in Corporate and Other segment revenues. 45 The following tables and commentary provide selected financial information on the operating segments. (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Operating segment revenue: (1) Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services $ 5,738 $ 5,593 $ 4,890 Consulting 1,247 1,185 1,046 Insurance Underwriting 3,150 2,883 2,801 Income before income tax: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services $ 629 $ 848 $ 805 Consulting 105 110 122 Insurance Underwriting 254 196 155 Pretax margins: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services 11.0 % 15.2 % 16.5% Consulting 8.4 % 9.3 % 11.7% Insurance Underwriting 8.1 % 6.8 % 5.5% (1)Intersegment revenues of $72 million and $68 million were included in 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services Aon is a leader in many sectors of the insurance industry: globally, it is the second largest insurance broker, the largest reinsurance broker and the leading manager of captive insurance companies worldwide. In the U.S., Aon is the largest wholesale broker. These rankings are based on the most recent surveys compiled and reports printed by Business Insurance. Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds. More specifically, lower premium rates, or a ""soft market,"" generally result in decreased commission revenues. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, premium rates saw an unprecedented increase. Since late 2003, however, premiums in the property and casualty marketplace have declined. The downward rate trend varies by line of business, area of the world, and when each line of business began its downward trend. This trend may inhibit brokers' ability to grow revenues. Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services generated approximately 57% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2004. Revenues are generated primarily through: •commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, •fees paid by clients, •other carrier compensation, and •interest income on funds held on behalf of clients. Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of: •how our clients' policy renewals are timed, •the net effect of new and lost business, •the timing of services provided to our clients, and •the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates. 46 Our retail brokerage companies operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as individual brokers and agents and direct writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, this segment: •addresses the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, healthcare providers, and non-profit groups, among others; •provides affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income and personal lines for individuals, associations and businesses; •provides wholesale brokerage, managing underwriting and premium finance services to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; •provides actuarial, loss prevention and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and •offers claims management and loss cost management services to insurance companies and firms with self-insurance programs. During 2004, we exited most of these activities by completing the sale of our U.K. claims operations in the second quarter of 2004 and our U.S. third party claims administration business in fourth quarter 2004. We review our revenue results using the following sub-segments: •Risk Management and Insurance Brokerage — Americas (Brokerage — Americas) encompasses our retail and wholesale brokerage services, affinity products, managing general underwriting, placement and captive management services, and premium finance services in North and South America, the Caribbean and Bermuda. •Risk Management and Insurance Brokerage — International (Brokerage — International) offers similar products and services to the parts of the world not included in Brokerage-Americas. •Reinsurance Brokerage and Related Services (Reinsurance) offers sophisticated advisory services in program design and claim recoveries that: —enhance the risk/return characteristics of insurance policy portfolios, —improve capital utilization, and —evaluate and mitigate catastrophic loss exposures worldwide. •Claims Services (Claims) offered claims administration and loss cost management services. We exited most of these activities in 2004 by selling our U.S. and U.K. claims administration businesses. Revenue Continuing the trend from late 2003, the insurance market softened further in 2004. Total 2004 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue was $5.7 billion or 3% over last year. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, revenue declined 1% over last year as a result of: •soft market conditions, reflected in flat organic revenue, •a $101 million reduction in revenue from our U.S. and one of our U.K. claims services businesses which were sold during 2004, and •a $35 million decline from contingent commissions. 47 This table details Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue by sub-segment.

Organic revenue growth was zero, reflecting pricing pressures resulting from an overall soft market and lower contingent commission revenue, which was offset by improved retention rates. •Brokerage—International revenue showed strong improvement as a result of a favorable foreign exchange impact and good organic growth, especially in Asia, France and Italy. •Reinsurance revenue decreased because new business growth was more than offset by lower pricing on retained clients, lower renewal business in the Americas, and higher risk retention by clients. •Claims revenue was $82 million lower in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the sale of one of our U.K. claims services businesses in January 2004. In addition, revenue declined due to the sale of our U.S. claims services business in November 2004, and lower levels of activity in our U.S. operation during the year.

Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, revenue would have declined 11%. Both the retail and reinsurance sectors declined, primarily as a result of decreased pricing pressures, higher retention of risk by clients and lower new business. In addition, revenue declined $82 million due to the sale in the first quarter 2004 of one of our U.K. claims services businesses. •Continent of Europe revenue increased 14% driven by a favorable foreign currency impact along with strong organic revenue growth in France and Italy. •The 13% growth in the Rest of World is driven by a favorable foreign currency impact and growth in Asia. Income Before Income Tax Pretax income decreased $219 million or 26% from 2003 to $629 million, despite the increase in revenue. In 2004, pretax margins in this segment were 11.0%, down from 15.2% in 2003. Our income and margins were affected this year by: •a $153 million provision allocation for regulatory settlements resulting from the investigation by the New York AG and other regulatory authorities, •a $35 million reduction in contingent commission revenue, •additional net periodic pension expense of $39 million, •a $34 million provision for costs and payments to settle the Daniel class action lawsuit, •premium declines on brokered coverage, and •increase in investment income of $13 million. Consulting Aon Consulting is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations. This segment: •provides a full range of human capital management services from employee benefits to compensation consulting and •generated 12% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2004. We review our revenue results using the following sub-segments: •Consulting Services, which provides human capital consulting services in five practice areas: 1.Employee Benefits advises clients about the structure, funding and administration of employee benefit programs which attract, retain and motivate employees. Benefits consulting includes health and welfare, retirement, executive benefits, absence management, compliance, employer commitment, investment advisory and elective benefit services. 2.Compensation focuses on designing salary, bonus, commission, stock option and other pay structures, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries. 3.Management Consulting assists clients in process improvement and design, leadership, organization and human capital development, and change management. 4.Communications advises clients on how to communicate initiatives that support their corporate vision. 49 5.Strategic Human Resource Consulting advises complex global organizations on talent, change and organization effectiveness issues including assessment, selection performance management, succession planning, organization design and related people-management programs. •Outsourcing, which offers employment processing, performance improvement, benefits administration and other employment-related services. Revenue In 2004, revenues of $1.2 billion increased 5% over 2003. Revenue on an organic basis grew 1% from last year and resulted from growth in U.S. compensation and international practices, especially in Europe, offset by lower revenue in U.S. employee benefits. In connection with our termination of contingent fee arrangements, contingent commissions decreased $2 million from the fourth quarter 2003 compared to the fourth quarter 2004. This table details Consulting revenue by sub-segment. (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Consulting services $ 949 $ 898 $ 796 Outsourcing 298 287 250 Total revenue $ 1,247 $ 1,185 $ 1,046 This table reconciles organic revenue growth to reported revenue growth in 2004 versus 2003.

Income Before Income Tax Pretax income was $105 million. In 2004, pretax margins in this segment were 8.4%, down from 9.3% in 2003. The decline was caused by a $27 million provision allocation for settlements resulting from the investigation by the New York AG and other regulatory authorities, a $6 million accrual for costs and payments to settle the Daniel class action lawsuit, and a $2 million reduction of contingent commission revenue. The legal accruals and loss of contingent commission revenue were partially offset by: •favorable foreign exchange rates, •improved profitability of the large human resource outsourcing contract initiated in mid-2002, and •effective expense management. Insurance Underwriting The Insurance Underwriting segment: •provides supplemental accident, health and life insurance coverage mostly through direct distribution networks, primarily through more than 6,800 career insurance agents working for our subsidiaries. Our revenues are affected by our success in attracting and retaining these career agents; •provides Medicare supplement and Medicare Advantage policies in the U.S. through a dedicated sales force; •offers extended warranty and credit insurance products that are sold through retailers, automotive dealers, insurance agents and brokers, and real estate brokers. Our revenues are affected by the addition and retention of these retailers, dealers, agents and brokers; •offers select commercial property and casualty business on a limited basis through managing general underwriters, primarily Aon-owned companies; •administers certain extended warranty services on automobiles, electronic goods, personal computers and appliances; •has operations in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia/Pacific; and •generated approximately 31% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2004. We have: •expanded product distribution to include affinity groups and worksite marketing, which has created access to new markets and potential new policyholders; •implemented a ""back-to-basics"" strategy in 2003 which focused on products and regions with predictable cash flows and the best return on investment; •announced plans in February 2003 to place in run-off our accident and health insurance underwriting operations in Latin America. We stopped operations in Argentina, and during 2003, transitioned into run-off status in Brazil and Mexico; •decided to run off certain non-core special risk accident and health business in the U.S. and the U.K. 51 Revenue Written premiums and fees are the basis for organic revenue growth in this segment; however, reported revenues reflect earned premiums and fees. We review our revenue results using the following sub-segments: •Accident & Health and Life, through which we provide an array of accident, sickness, short-term disability and other supplemental insurance products. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation; •Warranty and Credit, through which we provide warranties on automobiles and a variety of consumer goods, including electronics and appliances. In addition, we provide non-structural home warranties and other warranty products, such as credit card enhancements and affinity warranty programs; and Property & Casualty, through which we provide select commercial property and casualty business on a limited basis.

In addition, a change in accounting for an insurance contract in the U.S. as a percentage change, was 6% for accident & health and life and 3% for total revenue. •Accident & Health and Life revenue grew $127 million or 8% driven by a change in an insurance program for a specialty accident and health line, favorable foreign currency exchange, higher investment income and growth in the core business, partially offset by planned reductions in runoff businesses of $25 million. •Warranty, Credit and Property & Casualty revenue grew $140 million or 11% due to improvement in our North American warranty, as well as European auto and warranty programs, growth in the select property and casualty business, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates.

This increase is primarily the result of a favorable exchange rate impact, as well as improvements in our European auto and warranty programs. Income Before Income Tax Pretax income of $254 million increased 30% from 2003. Pretax margins rose from 6.8% in 2003 to 8.1% in 2004. 53 Increased pretax income and margin resulted from: •$65 million of expense relating to the NPS program in 2003, •improved profitability in the traditional lines of accident & health and life, •higher investment income of $14 million due to changes in the investment portfolio which increased both duration and returns, •positive foreign exchange effects, and •profitable growth in North American auto warranty and specialty property & casualty programs. These increases were partially offset by: •lower international auto credit results because auto dealerships continue to de-emphasize some credit products and •declines in U.S. electronic warranty results due to discontinued programs, as well as losses related to a European electronics warranty program. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other segment revenue consists primarily of investment income (including income or loss on investment disposals and other-than-temporary impairment losses), which is not otherwise reflected in the operating segments. This segment includes: •invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting businesses and •the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries and related income. Corporate and Other segment revenue includes income from Endurance common stock, which was accounted for under the equity method before the sale of virtually all of our holdings in December 2004, and changes in the valuation of Endurance warrants. Aon carries its investment in Endurance warrants at fair value and records changes in the fair value through Corporate and Other segment revenue. Private equities are principally carried at cost except where Aon has significant influence, in which case they are carried under the equity method. These investments usually do not pay dividends. Limited partnerships (LP) are accounted for under the equity method and changes in the value of the underlying LP investments flow through Corporate and Other segment revenue. Although our portfolios are highly diversified, they still remain exposed to market, equity, and credit risk. We: •periodically review securities with material unrealized losses and evaluate them for other-than-temporary impairments, •analyze various risk factors and identify any specific asset impairments. If we determine there is a specific asset impairment, we recognize a realized loss and adjust the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value, and •review invested assets with material unrealized losses each quarter. 54 This table shows the components of Corporate and Other revenue and expenses: (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenue: Income from marketable equity securities and other investments: Income from change in fair value of Endurance warrants $ — $ 80 $ — Equity earnings — Endurance 38 46 21 Other 11 11 10 49 137 31 Limited partnership investments 6 1 14 Interest on tax refund — — 48 Net gain (loss) on disposals and related expenses: Gain on sale of Endurance stock 48 — — Impairment write-downs (3 ) (36 ) (130 ) Other 9 23 16 54 (13 ) (114 ) Total revenue 109 125 (21 ) Expenses: General expenses 81 61 97 Interest expense 136 101 124 Unusual credits — World Trade Center — (14 ) — Total expenses 217 148 221 Loss before income tax $ (108 ) $ (23 ) $ (242 ) Revenue Corporate and Other revenue decreased by $16 million to $109 million in 2004. The revenue decrease was primarily driven by: •an $80 million non-cash increase in the value of the Endurance stock warrants recognized in 2003 where previously there had been no value recorded. The value of the Endurance warrants fluctuated during the year, but at year-end 2004 remained approximately $80 million. This was mostly offset by: •the sale of virtually all of our common stock investment in Endurance resulting in a $48 million gain and •lower impairment writedowns of certain fixed-maturity and equity investments of $3 million in 2004 versus $36 million in 2003. Loss Before Income Tax Corporate and Other expenses were $69 million or 47% higher than in 2003 as a result of: •an increase in interest expense of $35 million primarily due to the adoption at December 31, 2003 of FIN 46. As a result of this adoption, we were required to deconsolidate our trust preferred capital securities, which were offset by an increase in notes payable. Interest expense on these notes payable was $58 million for the year. Absent that item, interest expense declined $23 million due principally to a reduction in U.S. debt levels earlier in 2004; •an increase in general expenses of $20 million due in part to increases in compliance costs for the Sarbanes Oxley Act, compensation and occupancy expenses; and 55 •a net $14 million credit related to the World Trade Center in 2003 with no corresponding credit in 2004. These revenue and expense comparisons contributed to the overall Corporate and Other pretax loss of $108 million in 2004 versus a pretax loss of $23 million in 2003. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Liquidity Our routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock. Our primary source for meeting these requirements is from dividends and internal financing from our operating subsidiaries. Additionally, we fully drew down our long-term Euro credit facility to ensure adequate liquidity in the fourth quarter of 2004. After meeting our routine dividend and debt servicing requirements, we used a portion of the remaining funding we received throughout the year for capital expenditures. Our major U.S. insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus at year-end 2004 significantly exceeded the risk-based capital target set by the NAIC. In the aggregate, our operating subsidiaries anticipate there will be adequate liquidity to meet their needs in the foreseeable future and to provide funds to the parent company. We have used cash flow primarily for dividend payments, business reinvestment, debt reduction, and acquisition financing. Cash on our statements of financial position includes funds available for general corporate purposes. We segregate funds we are holding on behalf of clients and to satisfy policyholder liabilities. The cash payments for the $190 million settlement with the New York AG and other regulatory authorities will be funded through operating cash flow over the following time frame: (millions) Cash to be paid 2005 $ 76 2006 76 2007 38 Total cash payments $ 190 In addition to the New York AG and other regulatory authorities investigations, we are defending various client class action lawsuits. We accrued $40 million for costs and payments to settle the Daniel class action lawsuit. In 2004, total cash contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans were $189 million, a decrease of $28 million from 2003. In 2003, we made a $100 million early contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In 2004, we made an early contribution of $18 million for our Netherlands defined benefit pension plan. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate that 2005 contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans will be approximately $202 million. In connection with one of our U.K. pension plans, our principal U.K. subsidiary has agreed with the trustees of the plan to contribute £20 million per year to the plan for six years with the amount payable increasing by 5.3% on each January 1, beginning in 2005. These contributions are in addition to the normal employer contributions to the plan. The trustees of the plan: •have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding up deficit. As of December 31, 2003, the estimated winding up deficit was £345 million; and •have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions and have not requested such an advance. 56 At the last valuation date, September 30, 2004, the estimated deficit between the value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, calculated under U.S. GAAP, was £108 million, of which £92 million was recorded as a minimum pension liability. The U.K. pension plans have been closed to new employees since 1999. Cash Flows Cash flows from operations represent the net income we earned in the reported periods adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities for twelve months 2004 and 2003 are as follows: (millions) As of December 31, 2004 2003 Insurance Underwriting operating cash flows $ 541 $ 360 Change in funds held on behalf of brokerage and consulting clients (50 ) 200 All other operating cash flows 693 752 Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,184 $ 1,312 Insurance Underwriting operating cash flows Our insurance underwriting operations include accident & health and life, warranty, credit, and property & casualty businesses. These insurance products have distinct differences in the timing of premiums earned and payment of future liabilities. The operating cash flow from our insurance subsidiaries, which also includes related corporate items, was $541 million for 2004 compared to $360 million for 2003. For 2004, operating cash flows, analyzed by major income statement component, indicated that premiums and other fees collected, net of reinsurance, were $3,167 million. Investment income and other miscellaneous income received was $159 million. We used these revenues primarily to pay claims and other cash benefits of $1,382 million, commission and general expenses of $1,325 million, and taxes of $78 million. The comparable 2003 premiums and other fees collected, net of reinsurance, were $2,931 million. Investment income and other miscellaneous income received was $141 million. Payments included claims and other cash benefits of $1,223 million, commission and general expenses of $1,366 million, and taxes of $123 million. We will invest and use operating cash flows to satisfy future benefits to policyholders, and when appropriate, make them available to pay dividends to the Aon parent company (Aon Parent). In second quarter 2004, Combined Insurance Company of America (CICA), one of our major insurance underwriting subsidiaries, declared and made a non-cash dividend of $71 million to Aon Parent. Generally, we invest assets supporting policyholder liabilities in highly liquid and marketable investment grade securities. These invested assets are subject to insurance codes set forth by the various governmental jurisdictions in which we operate, both domestically and internationally. The insurance codes restrict both the quantity and quality of various types of assets within the portfolios. Our insurance subsidiaries' policy liabilities are segmented among multiple accident and health and property casualty portfolios. Those portfolios have widely varying estimated durations and interest rate characteristics. Generally, policy liabilities are not subject to interest rate volatility disintermediation risk. Therefore, in many of the portfolios, asset and policy liability duration are not closely matched. Interest rate sensitive policy liabilities are generally supported by floating rate assets. 57 Funds held on behalf of clients In our risk and insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, we typically hold funds on behalf of clients as a result of: •premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers. These premiums held on behalf of, or due from, clients are reported as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurer. •claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us, and which are due to clients, are also shown as both assets and liabilities. These funds held on behalf of clients can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect cash from our clients and when premiums are remitted to the insurance carriers. All other operating cash flows The operating cash flow from our risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting segments, as well as related corporate items, was $693 million for 2004 compared to $752 million for the comparable period in 2003. These amounts exclude the change in funds held on behalf of clients from year-end of approximately $(50) million in 2004 and $200 million in 2003, as described above. The operating cash flows depend on the timing of receipts and payments related to revenues, incentive compensation, other operating expenses, and income taxes. In 2004, the net decrease in cash from our risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting segments, and related corporate items, of $59 million was primarily affected by the timing of income tax payments, net of refunds. Aon Parent uses the excess cash generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses to meet its liquidity needs, which consist primarily of servicing its debt and for paying dividends to its stockholders. Investing and Financing Activities We used the consolidated cash flow from operations (net of funds held on behalf of clients) of $1.2 billion for: •investing activities of $923 million. The cash flows used by investing activities included purchases of investments, net of sales, of $896 million and acquisitions, principally made by our international brokerage operations, of $80 million. Additionally, our investing activities included capital expenditures, net of disposals, of $80 million, and proceeds from the sale of operations of $133 million. •financing needs of $266 million. Financing uses included cash dividends paid to shareholders of $192 million, long-term debt issuance, net of payments of $3 million, net repayment of short-term debt of $49 million, and cash payments of $51 million for interest sensitive, annuity and investment-type contracts. During fourth quarter 2004, we fully drew down our long-term Euro facility to ensure adequate liquidity prior to replacing both our long-term Euro and U.S. credit facilities, which occurred in February 2005. See Note 7 ""Debt and Lease Commitments"" for further information on our credit facilities. Financial Condition Since year-end 2003, total assets increased $1.3 billion to $28.3 billion at December 31, 2004. In 2004, total investments increased $1.3 billion to $8.6 billion from December 31, 2003. Fixed maturities increased $731 million, primarily relating to an asset management program at our insurance underwriting subsidiaries that became effective in 2003, which resulted in a shift from short-term to long-term investments. Short-term investments rose $801 million, primarily as a result of an increase in 58 funds from the sale of our common stock investment in Endurance, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates. Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting receivables decreased $153 million in 2004. Corresponding insurance premiums payable decreased $82 million over the same period. The decrease in receivables and payables reflects: •the timing of receipts and payments and •the decrease in premium rates across most lines of business. Other assets decreased $223 million from December 31, 2003. Other assets are comprised principally of prepaid premiums related to reinsurance and prepaid pension assets. The decrease from year-end 2003 is due to: •a reduction of $58 million due to the adoption of SOP 03-1; •the conversion of $55 million of life insurance policies to cash; and •a reduction in prepaid premiums. Policy liabilities in total, excluding other policyholder funds, increased $501 million, but were partially offset by a corresponding increase in reinsurance receivables (reflected in other receivables). Other policyholder funds decreased $40 million from 2003 due primarily to interest sensitive and deposit-type contracts maturing and our decision to stop offering these programs. Our minimum defined benefit pension liability, included in pension, post retirement and post employment liabilities, increased $157 million since last year-end. We are required to maintain at plan level, at a minimum, a liability equal to the difference between the present value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations. Investments We invest in broad asset categories related to our diversified operations. In managing our investments, our objective is to maximize earnings while monitoring asset and liability durations, interest and credit risks and regulatory requirements. We maintain well-capitalized operating companies. The financial strength of these companies permits a diversified investment portfolio including invested cash, fixed-income obligations, public and private equities and limited partnerships. The Corporate and Other segment contains invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, together with the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the underwriting business and related income. These insurance assets, which are publicly traded equities, as well as less liquid private equities and limited partnerships, represent an aggressive investment strategy that gives us an opportunity for greater returns with longer-term investments. These assets, owned by the insurance underwriting companies: •are necessary to support strong claims paying ratings by independent rating agencies and •are unavailable for other uses such as debt reduction or share repurchases without considering regulatory requirements (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). In December 2001, we securitized $450 million of our LP investments and associated LP commitments, which represented most of our limited partnership investments, via a sale of PEPS I. The securitization gives our underwriting subsidiaries greater liquidity. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments. 59 Borrowings Total debt at December 31, 2004 was $2.1 billion, down $31 million from December 31, 2003. Specifically: •notes payable increased by $20 million compared to year-end 2003. This increase is due to an increase in our long-term Euro credit facility of $334 million, mostly offset by retiring $305 million of outstanding domestic debt securities due in January and July 2004. We fully drew down our Euro credit facility to ensure adequate liquidity in the fourth quarter of 2004; and •short-term debt declined $51 million, reflecting a decrease in foreign borrowings. We have disclosed future payments of notes payable and operating lease commitments (with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year) in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2002, we completed an offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% convertible senior debentures due 2012. The debentures are unsecured obligations and are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately $21.475 per common share under certain circumstances, including the following: •If the closing price of our common stock during any fiscal quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price (i.e. $25.77) for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter. Or •Subject to certain exceptions, during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures for each day of the ten trading day period was less than 95% of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of the debentures. Aon has reserved approximately 14 million shares for the potential conversion of these debentures. At December 31, 2004, we had a $775 million unused committed bank credit facility to support commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. The three year portion of the facility was for $437.5 million, while the 364-day portion of the facility was for $337.5 million. We replaced the facility in February 2005 with a three year $600 million facility. This facility allows us to issue up to $150 million in letters of credit. We also have several foreign credit facilities available. At December 31, 2004, we had available to us: •a long-term Euro credit facility of €250 million, or $334 million, which was fully drawn down at year-end. This facility was replaced in February 2005 with a new €650 million multi-currency facility, which includes a €325 million three-year and €325 million five-year facility. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on both the U.S. and Euro facilities; •a 364-day £45 million facility and a 10 million Canadian dollar facility, both of which expire in September 2005; and •a €20 million open-ended facility. 60 The major rating agencies' ratings of our debt at March 9, 2005 appear in the table below. Senior long-term debt Commercial paper Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Standard & Poor's BBB+ Negative A-2 Negative Moody's Investor Services Baa2 Stable P-2 Stable Fitch, Inc. BBB+ Negative F-2 Negative In October 2004: •Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered its rating on our senior long-term debt from ""A-"" to ""BBB+"" and placed all its ratings for Aon on credit watch with negative implications; and •Moody's Investor Services and Fitch, Inc. placed both our senior long-term debt and commercial paper ratings on negative outlook and credit watch with negative implications, respectively. In March 2005: •Fitch, Inc. lowered its ratings on our senior debt from ""A-"" to ""BBB+"" and affirmed our commercial paper rating of ""F2"". Their rating outlook continues to be negative; •S&P affirmed its ratings for Aon and removed us from credit watch; and •Moody's affirmed its ratings for Aon and changed their outlook from negative to stable. The change in our ratings reflect the rating agencies' concern for Aon's future earnings and cash flow given the announcement eliminating contingent commission arrangements, the New York AG and other regulatory authorities' investigations, and concerns about private litigation. A further downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper will: •increase the company's borrowing costs and reduce its financial flexibility. The Company's 6.20% notes due 2007 ($250 million of which are outstanding with a current interest rate of 6.70%) expressly provide for interest rate increases in the case of certain ratings downgrades. Because of the recent downgrade, the interest rate on these notes increased 25 basis points in January 2005 to 6.95%; and •increase Aon's commercial paper interest rates or may restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether. Although we have committed backup lines in excess of our current outstanding commercial paper borrowings, we cannot assure that the company's financial position will not be hurt if we can no longer access the commercial paper market. Additional rating changes were as follows: •In May 2004, A.M. Best, a major rating agency for our insurance company subsidiaries, changed its ratings for our two major insurance subsidiaries as follows: CICA from ""A"" stable outlook to ""A"" negative outlook; Virginia Surety Company from ""A"" stable outlook to ""A-"" stable outlook. •In August 2004, Moody's Investor Services raised its rating for CICA from ""Baa1"" stable outlook to ""A3"" stable outlook. •In October 2004, Fitch, Inc. lowered its rating for CICA from ""A-"" stable outlook to ""A-"" negative outlook. 61 Stockholders' Equity Stockholders' equity increased $605 million during 2004 to $5.1 billion, primarily reflecting: •$546 million of net income before preferred dividends and •a $146 million (after tax) foreign exchange benefit. These equity increases were partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders of $192 million. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $180 million since December 31, 2003. Compared to year-end 2003: •net foreign exchange improved by $146 million because of the weakening U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, •net derivative losses increased $10 million, and •net unrealized investment gains rose $42 million. In past years, some of our defined benefit pension plans, particularly in the U.K., incurred losses due to reduced actuarial return assumptions. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require a company to maintain, at a minimum, a liability on its balance sheet equal to the difference between the present value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations. At year-end 2004, the change in pension obligation caused a $2 million (after-tax) increase to stockholders' equity. We maintain the related pension plan assets in separate trust accounts; they are not part of our consolidated financial statements. This non-cash adjustment to other comprehensive income did not affect 2004 net income. For 2005, we project: •our pension expense for our major defined benefit plans will be $251 million. This expense was significantly affected by a lower discount rate; and •cash contributions to the major defined benefit pension plans will be $202 million. Our total debt and preferred securities as a percentage of total capital is 29.8% at December 31, 2004, compared to 32.8% at year-end 2003. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We record various contractual obligations as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but we are required to disclose them. Aon and its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $21 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. We accrue amounts in our consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable. As discussed below, we use special purpose entities and qualifying special purpose entities (""QSPE's""), also known as special purpose vehicles, in some of our operations, following the guidance of FASB Statement No. 140 and other relevant accounting guidance. Premium Financing Certain of our subsidiaries make short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) to businesses to finance insurance premiums and then sell (""securitize"") the finance receivables through securitization transactions that meet the criteria for sale accounting in accordance with FASB Statement 62 No. 140. These premium-financing securitizations are accomplished by using special purpose entities which are considered QSPEs pursuant to Statement No. 140 and FIN 46, and commercial paper multi-seller, non-qualified bank conduit SPEs. Statement No. 140 provides that a QSPE should not be consolidated in the financial statements of a transferor or its affiliates (Aon's subsidiaries). Premium financing securitizations performed by our U.S., U.K., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries use multi-seller non-qualified SPEs. By analyzing the qualitative and quantitative factors of the SPEs, we have determined that these subsidiaries are not the sponsors of the SPEs. Additionally, independent third parties: •have made substantial equity investments in the SPEs, •have voting control of the SPEs, and •generally have the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets of the SPEs. Based on these factors and before the adoption of FIN 46, we had determined that non-consolidation was the appropriate accounting treatment. With the adoption of FIN 46 as of December 31, 2003, we have determined that our subsidiaries do not have a significant variable interest in the SPEs, and therefore, we have concluded that non-consolidation continues to be appropriate. Through the premium financing agreements, we or one of our QSPEs sells undivided interests in specified premium finance receivables to the independent SPEs. Under the terms of these agreements, new receivables increase the amounts available to securitize as collections (administered by Aon) and reduce previously sold receivables. The amount advanced from third parties at any one time under the accounts receivable sales agreement is limited to a maximum of $2 billion. At both December 31, 2004 and 2003, $1.8 billion was advanced under these programs from the SPEs. We record at fair value the retained interest, which is included in insurance brokerage and consulting services receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position. Aon recorded gains associated with the sale of receivables. When we calculated the gain, we included all fees we incurred related to this facility. The gains included in revenue in the consolidated statements of income, were $81 million, $69 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We retain servicing rights for sold receivables and earn a servicing fee as income over the servicing period. The servicing fees are included in the gain/loss calculation. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of the servicing rights approximates the estimated costs to service the receivables, and accordingly, Aon has not recorded any servicing assets or liabilities related to this servicing activity. We estimate fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows from the servicing rights and servicing costs using: •discount rates that approximate current market rates and •expected future prepayment rates. The SPEs bear the credit risks on the receivables, subject to limited recourse in the form of credit loss reserves, which we guarantee. Under the guarantee provisions, our maximum cash requirement was approximately $73 million at December 31, 2004. We renewed the U.S. and European facilities in December 2004 and in January 2005, we eliminated the percentage guarantee for the European facility, replacing it with other collateral enhancements. In April 2005, we will do the same for the U.S. facility. 63 Both facilities require Aon to maintain consolidated net worth, as defined, of at least $2.5 billion, and: •consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated net interest of at least 4 to 1, and •consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of no more than 3 to 1. We intend to renew these conduit facilities when they expire. If there were adverse bank, regulatory, tax or accounting rule changes, our access to the conduit facilities and special purpose vehicles would be restricted. These special purpose vehicles are not included in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the appropriate accounting standards. PEPS I On December 31, 2001, we sold the vast majority of our LP portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company, owned by one of our subsidiaries (49%) and by a charitable trust, which we do not control, established for victims of the September 11th attacks (51%). PEPS I sold approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities to unaffiliated third parties. It then paid our insurance underwriting subsidiaries the $171 million in cash and issued them an additional $279 million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services rated the fixed-maturity securities our subsidiaries received from PEPS I as investment grade. As part of this transaction, the insurance companies had been required to purchase from PEPS I additional fixed-maturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded LP commitments as they are requested. In 2004, Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries funded $13 million of commitments. Beginning in July 2004, Aon Parent assumed this responsibility. Aon Parent funded $7 million of commitments in 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the unfunded commitments amounted to $60 million. These commitments have specific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments. Based on the rating agencies' downgrade of Aon's senior debt credit rating in October 2002, we purchased credit support agreements in January 2003, and as a result, $100 million of CICA's cash has been pledged as collateral for these commitments. During second quarter 2004, the balance of the collateral, $59 million, was paid as a dividend to Aon Parent. Given the current ratings of Aon, CICA and Virginia Surety Corporation, the collateral was no longer required. As such, the collateral account was liquidated in December 2004 and the funds returned to Aon's operating cash. Subsequent to closing the securitization, one of our insurance subsidiaries sold PEPS I fixed-maturity securities with a value of $20 million to Aon. In second quarter 2004, CICA paid dividends to Aon Parent of $12 million in fixed-maturities securities. We have not included the assets and liabilities and operations of PEPS I in our consolidated financial statements. In previous years, Aon has recognized other than temporary impairment writedowns of $59 million, equal to the original cost of one tranche. The preferred stock interest represents a beneficial interest in securitized limited partnership investments. The fair value of the private preferred stock interests depends on the value of the limited partnership investments held by PEPS I. Management assesses other-than-temporary declines in the fair value below cost using a financial model that considers the: •value of the underlying limited partnership investments of PEPS I and •nature and timing of the cash flows from the underlying limited partnership investments of PEPS I. 64 Combined Global Funding In 1998, CICA, an Aon subsidiary, formed Combined Global Funding, LLC, a Cayman Islands-based SPE, to issue notes to investors under a European Medium-Term Note Program (EMTN). We used the proceeds of the notes to purchase funding agreement policies issued by CICA. The contract terms of the funding agreement mirror the terms of the trust medium-term notes. Historically, CICA has consolidated the SPE based on the guidance in ARB 51 and EITF Topic D-14; more specifically, we have: •classified the EMTNs as a policyholder liability in our consolidated financial statements rather than as notes payable, given that the liquidation preference of the underlying debt more closely resembled the characteristics of a policyholder liability; and •included the interest expense on the EMTNs in benefits to policyholders in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of EMTNs outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $18 million and $50 million, respectively. In 2005, the remaining outstanding EMTN and the corresponding funding agreement are scheduled to be redeemed. After the adoption of FIN 46, Aon determined that the SPE is a variable interest entity, and CICA is not the primary beneficiary, because CICA does not have a variable interest in the SPE. As a result, CICA was required to deconsolidate the trust on December 31, 2003. There was no effect on the consolidated statements of financial position or income statements as a result of this deconsolidation, as the funding agreement liability between CICA and the SPE is now classified as a policyholder liability. Contractual Obligations The following table: •summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 and the future periods during which we expect to settle these obligations in cash. •reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings. 65 We have provided additional details about these obligations in our footnotes to the financial statements as noted below.

(2)Included in purchase obligations is a $517 million contract for information technology outsourcing with Computer Sciences Corporation. We are free to terminate this contract at any time for an amount calculated per the contract. However, given the nature of the contract, we have included it in our contractual obligations table. (3)Also included in purchase obligations is a $179 million contract for information technology services in the U.K. As of December 31, 2004, we can exit this obligation for approximately $25 million. However, given the nature of the contract, we have included it in our contractual obligations table. (4)The $180 million net present value of this liability has been reflected on the December 31, 2004 balance sheet in other liabilities. We also have obligations with respect to our pension and other benefit plans (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements as well as our discussion on liquidity above). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. To manage the risk arising from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. Aon does not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading purposes. The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. Please see the discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements. We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Our primary exposures are to the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar. We use over-the-counter (OTC) options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign operations. 66 Additionally, some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiary earns approximately 31% of its revenue in U.S. dollars, but the majority of its expenses are incurred in pounds sterling. Our policy is to convert into pounds sterling sufficient U.S. dollar revenue to fund the subsidiary's pound sterling expenses using over-the-counter (OTC) options and forward exchange contracts. At December 31, 2004, we have hedged 89%, 67% and 52% of our U.K. subsidiaries' expected U.S. dollar transaction exposure for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. We do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years. The impact to 2004 and 2003 pretax income in the event of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the respective quoted year-end exchange rates would not be material given derivative positions. The nature of the income of our businesses is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates and, as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the period end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $10 million and $9 million to 2004 and 2003 pretax income, respectively. The valuation of our fixed-maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 1% (100 basis point) increase in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of the portfolio at December 31, 2004 and 2003 by approximately $119 million and $90 million, respectively. We have notes payable and preferred securities outstanding with a fair value of $2.3 billion at both December 31, 2004 and 2003. This fair value was greater than the carrying value by $165 million and $234 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A hypothetical 1% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value by approximately 5% and 7% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The valuation of our marketable equity security portfolio is subject to equity price risk. If market prices were to decrease by 10%, the fair value of the equity portfolio would have a corresponding decrease of $4 million at both December 31, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no outstanding derivatives hedging the price risk on the equity portfolio. PEPS I — In December 2001, Aon securitized $450 million of limited partnership investments, plus associated limited partnership commitments, via a sale to PEPS I. Aon received $171 million in cash plus $279 million of newly-issued fixed maturity and preferred stock securities of PEPS I. The underlying equity in the limited partnerships was the basis for determining the fair value of the cash and securities received in the securitization. At December 31, 2004, a 10% or 20% decrease in the underlying equity of the limited partnerships would have resulted in a decrease in the value of the preferred stock securities owned by $33 million and $67 million, respectively. We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events. We believe that these changes in rates and prices are reasonably possible within a one-year period. 67 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. Our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report on page 69. /s/ PATRICK G. RYAN Patrick G. Ryan Chairman & Chief Executive Officer March 9, 2005 /s/ DAVID P. BOLGER David P. Bolger Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer March 9, 2005 68 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Stockholders Aon Corporation We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Aon Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Aon Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management's assessment that Aon Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Aon Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Aon Corporation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 and our report dated March 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Chicago, Illinois March 9, 2005 69 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Financial Statements Board of Directors and Stockholders Aon Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Aon Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Aon Corporation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 1, in 2004 the Company changed its method of calculating earnings per share, and in 2003 the Company changed its method of accounting for its involvement with certain variable interest entities. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aon Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (Aon) (excluding special-purpose entities (""VIEs"") considered variable interest entities for which Aon is not the primary beneficiary). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from the amounts reported. Segment Reporting Aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services, Consulting and Insurance Underwriting. A fourth segment, Corporate and Other, when aggregated with the operating segments, and after the elimination of intersegment revenues, totals to the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Certain amounts in prior years' consolidated financial statements relating to segments have been reclassified to reflect the results of discontinued operations. Brokerage Commissions and Fees Commission income is recognized at the later of the billing or effective date of the policy. However, in circumstances where a binding order has been received before the end of the accounting period and coverage is effective, but processing has not yet occurred in the billing system due to timing, an accrual is recorded. For policies that are billed in installments, commissions are recognized when Aon has sufficient information to estimate the amounts. Aon's policy for estimating allowances for return commissions on policy cancellations is to record an allowance based on a historical evaluation of cancellations as a percentage of related revenue. Certain life insurance commissions, commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance companies and certain other carrier compensation are generally recognized as income when received. Revenues may be recorded in advance of the cash receipts in cases where the amounts due to be received have been confirmed by the insurance company, or when Aon has sufficient information in its records to estimate amounts for premium based revenue accruals in accordance with agreements Aon has with insurance carriers. Commissions on premium adjustments are recognized as they occur. Fees for claims services, benefit consulting, human capital outsourcing, reinsurance services and other services are recognized when the services are rendered. Aon has multiple year outsourcing arrangements with clients. Revenues received from these arrangements are recorded on a gross basis, inclusive of amounts ultimately passed through to subcontractors, when Aon maintains the performance obligation, and are recorded ratably over the life of the contract. The portion of the revenues received on extended warranty contracts that are for the marketing, administration and servicing of those contracts are reported as earned consistent with the method used to earn the premium portion of those revenues, and revenues that represent administrative fee-for-service arrangements, for which Aon does not bear the underwriting risk, are earned as those services are performed. These fee-for-service arrangements include the marketing and servicing of extended warranty contracts on behalf of other companies and brokerage commissions for accident and health products placed with non-Aon insurance carriers. These revenues are reported in the Insurance Underwriting segment. 76 Premium Revenue For accident and health products, premiums are reported as earned in proportion to insurance protection provided over the period covered by the policies. For life products, premiums are recognized as revenue when due. For extended warranty products, premium revenues represent the portion of revenue from these contracts that are submitted to an Aon insurance carrier for coverage and are earned over the period of risk in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided in accordance with FASB Statement No. 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises. Reinsurance Reinsurance premiums, commissions and expense reimbursements on reinsured business are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Premiums and benefits to policyholders ceded to other companies have been reported as a reduction of premium revenue and benefits to policyholders. Expense reimbursements received in connection with reinsurance ceded have been accounted for as a reduction of the related policy acquisition costs. Reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premium amounts are reported as assets. Unusual Credit — World Trade Center During November 2002, a partial settlement was reached with Aon's property insurance carriers pertaining to reimbursement for depreciable assets destroyed during the attack on the World Trade Center. This settlement resulted in a pretax credit of $29 million, which is reported as an Unusual Credit — World Trade Center in the 2002 consolidated statement of income. In order to resume business operations and minimize the loss caused by the World Trade Center disaster, Aon secured temporary office space in Manhattan. Subsequently, permanent space was leased and, during first quarter 2003, Aon assigned this temporary space to another company. The costs relating to this assignment were $46 million pretax in 2003. In fourth quarter 2003, Aon reached a final settlement of approximately $200 million for its overall World Trade Center property insurance claim. A cash payment of approximately $92 million was received during fourth quarter 2003, in addition to the $108 million already collected in prior years. This settlement resulted in a pretax gain of $60 million. This gain, and the $46 million expense discussed above, were combined and reported as a $14 million Unusual credit — World Trade Center in the 2003 consolidated statement of income. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that are currently in effect. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not realizable. Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available for common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Net income available for common stockholders is net of all preferred stock dividends. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income available for common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus the dilutive effect of stock options and awards. The dilutive effect of stock options and awards is calculated under the treasury stock method using the average market price for the period. Certain common stock equivalents related to options were not included in the computation of diluted income per share because those options' exercise price was greater than the average market 77 price of the common shares. The number of options excluded from the calculation was 20 million in 2004 and 24 million in 2003 and 2002. As a result of the ratification of Emerging Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Investments on Diluted Earnings Per Share, Aon is required to include in its diluted net income per share computation the impact of any contingently convertible instruments regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. Aon's 3.5% convertible debt securities, issued in November 2002, may be converted into a maximum of 14 million shares of Aon common stock, and these shares have been included in the computation of diluted net income per share. Prior periods diluted net income per share computations have been adjusted for the effects of EITF No. 04-8 (see Note 1, Accounting and Disclosure Changes, and Note 7 for further information). Income per share is calculated as follows: (millions except per share data) 2004 2003 2002 Basic net income: Income from continuing operations $ 577 $ 676 $ 496 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (31 ) (48 ) (30 ) Net income 546 628 466 Preferred stock dividends (3 ) (3 ) (3 ) Net income for basic per share calculation $ 543 $ 625 $ 463 Diluted net income: Income from continuing operations $ 577 $ 676 $ 496 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (31 ) (48 ) (30 ) Net income 546 628 466 Interest expense on convertible debt securities, net of tax 7 7 — Preferred stock dividends (3 ) (3 ) (3 ) Net income for diluted per share calculation $ 550 $ 632 $ 463 Basic shares outstanding 320 317 281 Effect of convertible debt securities 14 14 — Common stock equivalents 3 1 2 Diluted potential common shares 337 332 283 Basic net income per share: Income from continuing operations $ 1.80 $ 2.12 $ 1.76 Discontinued operations (0.10 ) (0.15 ) (0.11 ) Net income $ 1.70 $ 1.97 $ 1.65 Diluted net income per share: Income from continuing operations $ 1.72 $ 2.04 $ 1.75 Discontinued operations (0.09 ) (0.14 ) (0.11 ) Net income $ 1.63 $ 1.90 $ 1.64 Stock Compensation Plans Aon follows Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense is recognized for stock options when the exercise price of the options equals the market price of the stock at the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized 78 on a straight-line basis for stock awards based on the vesting period and market price at the date of the award. The following table illustrates pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share as if Aon had applied the fair value recognition provision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation. (millions, except per share data) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net income, as reported $ 546 $ 628 $ 466 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in reported net income, net of tax 29 31 14 Deduct: Stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards and options, net of tax 47 55 37 Proforma net income $ 528 $ 604 $ 443 Net income per share: Basic As reported $ 1.70 $ 1.97 $ 1.65 Pro forma 1.64 1.89 1.57 Diluted As reported $ 1.63 $ 1.90 $ 1.64 Pro forma 1.58 1.83 1.56 The fair value per share of options and awards granted is estimated as $6.15 and $25.32 in 2004, $3.59 and $18.33 in 2003, and $6.21 and $28.54 in 2002, respectively, on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2004 2003 2002 Dividend yield 2.3 % 2.3 % 2.25 % Expected volatility 27.0 % 23.4 % 21.1 % Risk-free interest rate 3.3 % 2.9 % 4.3 % Expected term life beyond vesting date (in years): Stock options 1.0 1.0 0.96 Stock awards — — — The compensation cost as generated by the Black-Scholes model may not be indicative of the future benefit, if any, that may be received by the option holder. Investments Short-term investments include certificates of deposit, money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with maturities of up to one year and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Fixed-maturity securities are available for sale and carried at fair value. The amortized cost of fixed maturities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts to maturity that are included in investment income. Marketable equity securities that are held directly by Aon are carried at fair value. Mortgage loans and policy loans are generally carried at cost or unpaid principal balance. Private equity investments are generally carried at cost, which approximates fair value, except where Aon has significant influence, in which case they are carried using the equity method of accounting. 79 Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities and marketable equity securities are excluded from income and are recorded directly in stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred income taxes. Endurance common stock and warrants — In December 2001, Aon invested $227 million in Endurance Specialty Holdings, Ltd. (Endurance), a Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance company that provides additional underwriting capacity to commercial property and casualty insurance and reinsurance clients. In March and December 2004, Aon sold approximately 1.4 million and 9.8 million shares, respectively, of Endurance stock, which resulted in a total pretax gain of approximately $48 million. After the December 2004 sale, the investment in Endurance was no longer accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying value of Aon's common stock investment in Endurance was $3 million and $298 million, respectively, representing approximately 0.1 million and 11.3 million shares, respectively. The remaining common stock investment in Endurance is included in Equity Securities in the consolidated statements of financial position. In conjunction with the initial common stock investment, Aon also received 4.1 million stock purchase warrants, which allow Aon to purchase additional Endurance common stock through December 2011. These warrants meet the definition of a derivative, which requires them to be recorded in the financial statements at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings on a current basis. Through December 31, 2002, these warrants were carried at zero value, which approximated their original cost. In 2003, Endurance completed its initial public offering, which provided a market value for the underlying shares and removed much of the uncertainty regarding the fair value of Endurance and the warrants. With the assistance of an independent third party, Aon has valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes pricing methodology and determined that the warrants had a fair value of approximately $80 million as of both December 31, 2004 and 2003. The assumptions used to value the Endurance stock purchase warrants were as follows: December 31, 2004 2003 • Maturity (in years) 6.96 7.96 • Spot Price $ 29.31 $ 30.50 • Risk Free Interest Rate 4.40 % 4.50 % • Dividend Yield 0.00 % 0.00 % • Volatility 17 % 24 % • Exercise Price $ 13.20 $ 15.96 The model assumes: the warrants are ""European-style,"" which means that they are valued as if the exercise can only occur on the expiration date; the spot and exercise prices are reduced by expected future dividends; and the dividend remains unchanged during the period the warrants are outstanding. Although Endurance currently pays a dividend, a zero dividend yield is used in the Endurance warrants valuation, because the future dividend payment value has been reflected in the spot and exercise prices. The change in value during the period was recognized as investment income in the Corporate and Other segment, and was $80 million for 2003. There was no net change in value during 2004. The future value of the warrants may vary considerably from the value at December 31, 2004 due to the price movement of the underlying shares, as well as the passage of time and changes in other factors that are employed in the valuation model. Limited partnership investments are carried using the equity method of accounting. Certain of the limited partnerships in which Aon invests have holdings in publicly-traded equities. Changes in market value of these indirectly-held equities flow through the limited partnerships' financial statements. Aon's proportionate share of these valuation changes is included in investment income in Aon's Corporate and Other segment. 80 PEPS I — In December 2001, Aon securitized $450 million of limited partnership investments, plus associated limited partnership commitments, via a sale to Private Equity Partnership Structures I, LLC (PEPS I). Aon received $171 million in cash plus $279 million of newly-issued fixed maturity and preferred stock securities of PEPS I. The underlying equity in the limited partnerships was the basis for determining the fair value of the cash and securities received in the securitization. No significant management assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the cash and securities received in the securitization or the value at December 31, 2004 or 2003. General — Income or loss on disposal of investments is computed using the specific cost of the security sold and is reported as investment income in the consolidated statements of income. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment losses on a quarterly basis. Impairment losses for declines in the value of investments attributable to issuer-specific events are determined based upon all relevant facts and circumstances for each investment and are recognized when appropriate in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and related guidance. For fixed-maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events where Aon has the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity, declines in value below cost are assumed to be temporary. Aon's policy for equity securities is to recognize impairment losses on specific securities that have had continuous material unrealized losses for more than three consecutive quarters, or less due to market conditions or industry-related events. Reserves for certain other investments are established based on an evaluation of the respective investment portfolio and current economic conditions. Write-downs and changes in reserves are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. In general, Aon ceases to accrue investment income when interest or dividend payments are in arrears. Accounting policies relating to derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 13. Cash Cash consists of cash on hand. Aon maintains premium trust bank accounts for premiums collected from insureds but not yet remitted to insurance companies of $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These funds, and a corresponding liability, are included in short-term investments and insurance premiums payable, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Aon's policy for estimating allowances for doubtful accounts with respect to receivables is to record an allowance based on a historical evaluation of write-offs, aging of balances, and other qualitative and quantitative analyses. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Costs of acquiring new and renewal insurance underwriting business, principally the excess of new commissions over renewal commissions, underwriting and sales expenses that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of new business, are deferred and reported as assets. For long-duration life and health products, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is related to, and based on the expected premium revenues of the policies. In general, amortization is adjusted to reflect current withdrawal experience. Expected premium revenues are estimated by using the same assumptions used in estimating future policy benefits. For extended warranty and short-duration health 81 insurance, costs of acquiring and renewing business are deferred and amortized as the related premiums and contract fees are earned. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Included in this category is internal use software, which is software that is acquired, internally developed or modified solely to meet internal needs, with no plan to market externally. Costs related to directly obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software are capitalized. These costs are generally amortized using the straight-line method over a range of 1 to 10 years. The weighted-average original life of Aon's software at December 31, 2004 is 4.7 years. The components of property and equipment, net are as follows: (millions) As of December 31, 2004 2003 Land and buildings $ 143 $ 155 Furniture, fixtures and equipment 389 407 Leasehold improvements 364 362 Computer equipment 307 414 Software 597 618 Automobiles 31 30 1,831 1,986 Less: Accumulated depreciation 1,167 1,159 Property and equipment, net $ 664 $ 827 Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $253 million, $251 million and $208 million, respectively. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair values of financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments: Carrying amounts approximate fair value. Fixed-maturity and equity securities: Fair value is based on quoted market prices or, if they are not actively traded, on estimated values obtained from independent pricing services. Derivative financial instruments: Fair value is based on quoted prices for exchange-traded instruments or the cost to terminate or offset with other contracts. Other investments are comprised of Aon's investment in Endurance common stock and warrants, mortgage loans, policy loans, private equity investments and limited partnerships. Endurance common stock: Until December 2004, Aon's investment in Endurance common stock was accounted for using the equity method of accounting and carried in Other Investments. Accordingly, its carrying value was determined by adjusting the initial cost of the investment with Aon's proportionate share of Endurance's net income and unrealized gains or losses since acquisition. Aon carried Endurance on the equity method due to its influence on Endurance's board of directors and various board committees. In 2004, Aon sold virtually all of its investment of Endurance common stock. The remaining investment (approximately 110,000 shares) is now accounted for at fair value and included in Equity Securities in the December 31, 2004 consolidated statement of financial position. Endurance warrants: Fair value is determined with the assistance of an independent third party using the Black-Scholes pricing model. 82 Mortgage loans and policy loans: Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates currently being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Private equity investments and limited partnerships: Carrying amounts approximate fair value, as it is generally not practical to estimate fair value without incurring excessive costs. Deposit-type contracts: Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. Notes payable: Fair value is based on quoted market prices for the publicly-traded portion and on estimates using discounted cash flow analyses based on current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements for the nonpublicly-traded portion. Future Policy Benefits, Policy and Contract Claims, Unearned Premiums and Contract Fees Future policy benefit liabilities on life, accident and health products have been provided on the net level premium method. The liabilities are calculated based on assumptions as to investment yield, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates that were determined at the date of issue and provide for possible adverse deviations. Interest assumptions are graded and range from 2% to 6% at December 31, 2004. Withdrawal assumptions are based principally on insurance subsidiaries' experience and vary by plan, year of issue and duration. Policy and contract claim liabilities represent estimates for reported claims, as well as provisions for losses incurred but not yet reported. These claim liabilities are based on historical experience and are estimates of the ultimate amount to be paid when the claims are settled. The estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency. The process of estimating and establishing policy and contract liabilities is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known; such adjustments are included in current operations. Unearned premiums and contract fees generally are calculated using the pro rata method based on gross premiums. However, in the case of extended warranty, credit life, and disability products, the unearned premiums and contract fees are calculated such that the premiums and contract fees are earned over the period of risk in a reasonable relationship to anticipated claims. The Company considers anticipated investment income in determining whether a premium deficiency exists. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. Foreign assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Net foreign exchange gains and losses on translation are generally reported in stockholders' equity, in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred income tax. The effect of exchange rate changes on the consolidated statements of income, after consideration of derivative hedging, was approximately $0.18 and $0.12 per diluted and basic share in 2004 and 2003, respectively. For 2002 it was insignificant. Accounting and Disclosure Changes In 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). FIN 46 provides a framework for identifying variable interest entities (VIEs) and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements. In general, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited-liability corporation, trust, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to finance its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) has equity owners at risk that 83 are unable to make significant decisions about its activities, or (3) has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive expected returns generated by its operations. FIN 46 requires a VIE to be consolidated if a party with an ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (""a variable interest holder"") is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of expected loss from the VIE's activities, is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns (if no party absorbs a majority of the VIE's expected losses), or both. A variable interest holder that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all of the VIE's assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the VIE as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about VIEs that the variable interest holder is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. FIN 46 was effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003. The provisions of FIN 46 were adopted as of December 31, 2003 for Aon's interests in VIEs that are special purpose entities (SPEs). Aon Capital A is a wholly-owned statutory business trust created for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (Capital Securities). The sole asset of Aon Capital A is a $726 million aggregate principal amount of Aon's 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due January 1, 2027. Aon determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and was required to deconsolidate the Trust based on the provisions of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003. Aon adopted the provisions of FIN 46 for its variable interests in all other VIEs as of March 31, 2004, which did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers' Disclosures about Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Statement No. 132(R) requires additional and expanded disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Aon adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 132(R) for domestic plans in 2003 and for foreign plans in 2004, as required. In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts (SOP 03-1). SOP 03-1 provides guidance on accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long-duration contracts and for separate accounts. Aon adopted SOP 03-1 as of January 1, 2004. The adoption of SOP 03-1 did not have a significant impact on the results of operations or stockholders' equity of Aon, but did affect the classification and presentation of certain balance sheet items. At January 1, 2004, other assets decreased by $58 million, which was offset by an increase in fixed maturities of $44 million, short-term investments of $8 million, other investments of $5 million and other receivables of $1 million. Correspondingly, the related $58 million of other liabilities declined by $52 million, offset by an increase in future policy benefits of $52 million. In October 2004, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 04-8 The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share. Contingent convertible instruments are generally convertible into common shares of an issuer after the common stock price has exceeded a predetermined threshold for a specific time period. EITF 04-8 requires that contingent convertible instruments be included in diluted earnings per share computations (if dilutive) regardless of whether the market price trigger (or other contingent feature) has been met. EITF 04-8 is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. Prior period diluted earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes are required to be adjusted. 84 Aon's 3.5% convertible debt securities, which were issued in November 2002 and are due November 2012, are contingently convertible. Aon included the effect of the 3.5% convertible debt securities in its diluted per share calculation in the second and third quarter 2004, as the closing price of Aon's common stock exceeded the threshold for the requisite time period during the previous quarter. Aon has adjusted its diluted earnings per share for each quarter and year-to-date period in 2003, as well as first quarter, six months and nine months 2004, to comply with requirements of EITF 04-8. The impact of EITF 04-8 on diluted net income per share is as follows: Reported Adjusted 2003: First quarter $ 0.48 $ 0.46 Second quarter 0.46 0.45 Six months 0.94 0.91 Third quarter 0.36 0.35 Nine months 1.30 1.26 Fourth quarter 0.67 0.65 Twelve months 1.97 1.90 2004: First quarter 0.53 0.51 Second quarter 0.52 0.52 Six months 1.04 1.03 Third quarter 0.36 0.36 Nine months 1.40 1.39 In 2003, the U.S. Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act) that will provide a prescription drug subsidy, beginning in 2006, to companies that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide drug benefits. In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 that provides guidance on the accounting and disclosure for the effects of the Act. Aon has determined that the benefits provided by its plan are not actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Accordingly, Aon has not recognized any benefit associated with the subsidy. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment. This Statement is a revision of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended, and requires entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). Statement No. 123 (R) covers various share-based compensation arrangements including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. Statement No. 123(R) eliminates the ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for share options, as provided in APB No. 25. Statement No. 123(R) is effective as of the beginning of the first interim period that begins after June 15, 2005. Aon is currently evaluating the Statement's transition methods and does not expect this Statement to have an effect materially different than that of the pro forma Statement No. 123 disclosures provided in Note 1. Reclassification Certain amounts in prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. 85 2. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are either its operating segments or one reporting level below the operating segment. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The impairment testing requires Aon to compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value at the valuation date, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the recorded amount of goodwill. Fair value is estimated based on various valuation metrics. In the fourth quarter 2004 and 2003, Aon completed its annual impairment review that affirmed there was no impairment as of October 1 (the annual evaluation date). The Company believes that the effects of the regulatory investigations and related effects described in Note 14 were adequately considered in its annual impairment review. In March 2005, the Company re-evaluated the results of its annual impairment review due to the subsequent developments on the matters described in Note 14 and concluded that its initial conclusions remain appropriate and that no impairment loss is required. When a business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it is included. The changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are as follows: (millions) Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services Consulting Insurance Underwriting Total Balance as of January 1, 2004 $ 3,886 $ 381 $ 242 $ 4,509 Goodwill acquired 69 1 — 70 Goodwill related to disposals (48 ) (5 ) — (53 ) Intersegment transfers 4 (4 ) — — Foreign currency revaluation 196 2 3 201 Balance as of December 31, 2004 $ 4,107 $ 375 $ 245 $ 4,727 Balance as of January 1, 2003 $ 3,487 $ 372 $ 240 $ 4,099 Goodwill acquired 60 1 — 61 Foreign currency revaluation 339 8 2 349 Balance as of December 31, 2003 $ 3,886 $ 381 $ 242 $ 4,509 Other intangible assets are classified into three categories: •""Customer Related and Contract Based"" intangible assets include client lists as well as non-compete covenants; •""Present Value of Future Profits"" intangible assets represent the future profits of purchased books of business of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries; and •""Marketing, Technology and Other"" intangible assets are all other purchased intangibles not included in the preceding categories. 86 Other intangible assets by asset class are as follows: (millions) Customer Related and Contract Based Present Value of Future Profits Marketing, Technology and Other Total As of December 31, 2004 Gross carrying amount $ 222 $ 87 $ 167 $ 476 Accumulated amortization 179 67 94 340 Net carrying amount $ 43 $ 20 $ 73 $ 136 As of December 31, 2003 Gross carrying amount $ 223 $ 87 $ 166 $ 476 Accumulated amortization 163 50 87 300 Net carrying amount $ 60 $ 37 $ 79 $ 176 The cost of other intangible assets is being amortized over a range of 2 to 10 years, with a weighted average original life of 8.1 years. Amortization expense for intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 is estimated to be $47 million, $38 million, $18 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively. When impairment indicators arise, Aon assesses the recoverability of its intangible assets through an analysis of expected future cash flows. 87 3. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of other comprehensive income (loss) and the related tax effects are as follows: (millions) Year ended December 31, 2004 Pretax Income Tax (Expense) Benefit Net of Tax Net derivative gains arising during the year $ 33 $ (14 ) $ 19 Reclassification adjustment (48 ) 19 (29 ) Net derivative losses (15 ) 5 (10 ) Unrealized holding gains arising during the year 70 (27 ) 43 Reclassification adjustment (2 ) 1 (1 ) Net unrealized investment gains 68 (26 ) 42 Net foreign exchange translation 197 (51 ) 146 Net additional minimum pension liability adjustment (18 ) 20 2 Total other comprehensive income $ 232 $ (52 ) $ 180 In 2004, the pretax amount of $18 million for net additional minimum pension liability adjustment includes $17 million related to the defined benefit pension plans in Canada and $38 million related to the defined benefit plans in Germany.

Business Combinations and Restructuring Charges Acquisitions In 2004, 2003 and 2002, Aon completed several immaterial acquisitions, primarily related to its insurance brokerage operations. The following table reflects the aggregate amounts paid, and intangible assets recorded, as a result of the acquisitions. (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Amounts paid: Cash $ 80 $ 56 $ 111 Common stock — 8 3 Total $ 80 $ 64 $ 114 Intangible assets: Goodwill $ 70 $ 45 $ 51 Other intangible assets 30 11 48 Total $ 100 $ 56 $ 99 Internal funds, short-term borrowings and common stock financed the acquisitions. The results of operations of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the dates they were acquired. Pro forma results of these acquisitions are not materially different from reported results. Restructuring charges In 1996 and 1997, Aon recorded restructuring liabilities as a result of the acquisition of Alexander & Alexander Services, Inc. (A&A) and Bain Hogg. The remaining liability of $33 million is for lease abandonments and other exit costs, and is being paid out over several years as planned. The following table sets forth the activity related to these liabilities: (millions) Balance at January 1, 2002 $ 58 Cash payments in 2002 (11 ) Foreign currency revaluation 4 Balance at December 31, 2002 51 Cash payments in 2003 (14 ) Foreign currency revaluation 3 Balance at December 31, 2003 40 Cash payments in 2004 (9 ) Foreign currency revaluation 2 Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 33 90 In 2000, Aon restructured its brokerage operations and recorded expenses of $294 million over the three years ended December 31, 2002.

These unpaid liabilities are included in general expenses in the consolidated statements of financial position. 91 5. Disposal of Operations In fourth quarter 2004, Aon sold Cambridge Integrated Services Group (""Cambridge""), its U.S. claims services business, which was included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, to Scandent Holdings Mauritius Limited (""SHM""), for $90 million in cash plus convertible preferred stock in SHM valued at $15 million. Because of Aon's convertible preferred stock holding and other factors, Cambridge's results prior to the sale date and a pretax gain of $15 million on the sale of this business were included in income from continuing operations. Due to a significant book-tax basis difference resulting primarily from goodwill, a tax benefit of $26 million was recorded on the sale. Discontinued Operations In third quarter 2004, Aon committed to sell a small non-core U.S. brokerage unit and recorded a pretax loss of $4 million in 2004 on the revaluation of this business, which was included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. This operation was sold in fourth quarter 2004. In second quarter 2004, Aon committed to sell its U.K. reinsurance brokerage runoff unit which was included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. This operation was sold in early third quarter 2004. A pretax gain of $1 million was recorded in 2004 for the sale of this business. In first quarter 2004, Aon committed to sell certain of its U.K. claims services businesses which were included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. The sale of these businesses was completed in early second quarter 2004 and resulted in a pretax loss of $24 million. Also during first quarter 2004, Aon sold a non-core Consulting subsidiary for a pretax gain of $4 million. In third quarter 2003, Aon committed to sell its automotive finance servicing business, which had been in run-off since first quarter 2001, and was included in the Corporate and Other Segment. A pretax loss on the revaluation of the business of $23 million was recorded in 2003. The sale was completed in fourth quarter 2003. 92 The operating results of all these businesses are classified as discontinued operations, and prior years' operating results have been reclassified to discontinued operations, as follows. (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: U.K. brokerage units $ 29 $ 79 $ 78 Consulting business — 8 8 U.S. brokerage unit 4 5 5 Automotive finance servicing business — 13 15 Total revenues $ 33 $ 105 $ 106 Pretax loss: Operations: U.K. brokerage units $ (16 ) $ (16 ) $ (11 ) Consulting business — (2 ) (2 ) U.S. brokerage unit (3 ) (3 ) (3 ) Automotive finance servicing business (1 ) (32 ) (31 ) (20 ) (53 ) (47 ) Revaluation gain (loss): U.K. brokerage units (23 ) — — Consulting business 4 — — U.S. brokerage unit (4 ) — — Automotive finance servicing business — (23 ) — (23 ) (23 ) — Total pretax loss $ (43 ) $ (76 ) $ (47 ) After-tax loss: Operations $ (13 ) $ (34 ) $ (30 ) Revaluation (18 ) (14 ) — Total $ (31 ) $ (48 ) $ (30 ) A&A Discontinued Operations Prior to its acquisition by Aon, A&A discontinued its property and casualty insurance underwriting operations in 1985, some of which were then placed into run-off, with the remainder sold in 1987. In connection with those sales, A&A provided indemnities to the purchaser for various estimated and potential liabilities, including provisions to cover future losses attributable to insurance pooling arrangements, a stop-loss reinsurance agreement and actions or omissions by various underwriting agencies previously managed by an A&A subsidiary. During 2003, Aon settled certain of these liabilities. The settlements had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2004, the liabilities associated with the foregoing indemnities were included in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Such liabilities amounted to $16 million, net of reinsurance recoverables and other assets of $82 million. The insurance liabilities represent estimates of known and future claims expected to be settled over the next 20 to 30 years, principally with regards to asbestos, pollution and other health exposures. Although these insurance liabilities represent a best estimate of the probable liabilities, adverse developments may occur given the nature of the information available and the variables inherent in the estimation processes. Based on current estimates, management believes that the established liabilities for the A&A discontinued operations are sufficient. 93 6.

Aon had no fixed maturities below investment grade with an unrealized loss. Aon's fixed-maturity portfolio in total had a $21 million gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2004, excluding $1 million related to deferred amortizable derivative losses, and is subject to interest rate, market, and credit risks. No single position had an unrealized loss greater than $1 million. With a carrying value of approximately $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004, Aon's total fixed-maturity portfolio is approximately 97% investment grade based on market value. Fixed-maturity securities with an unrealized loss are all investment grade and have a weighted average rating of ""Aa"" based on amortized cost. Aon's non publicly-traded fixed maturity portfolio had a carrying value of $354 million, including $82 million in notes received from PEPS I on December 31, 2001 related to the securitization of limited partnerships and $90 million in notes issued by PEPS I to Aon during 2004, 2003 and 2002. Valuations of these securities primarily reflect the fundamental analysis of the issuer and current market price of comparable securities. 97 Aon's equity portfolio is comprised of non-redeemable preferred stocks, publicly traded common stocks and other common and preferred stocks not publicly traded. This portfolio had no gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2004, and is subject to interest rate, market, credit, illiquidity, concentration and operational performance risks. Limited Partnership Securitization. On December 31, 2001, Aon sold the vast majority of its limited partnership (LP) portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company which is owned by one of Aon's subsidiaries (49%) and by a charitable trust, which is not controlled by Aon, established for victims of the September 11th attacks (51%). Approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities were sold by PEPS I to unaffiliated third parties. PEPS I then paid Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries the $171 million in cash and issued to them an additional $279 million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities. The fixed-maturity securities Aon subsidiaries received from PEPS I are rated as investment grade by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Aon recognized impairment writedowns on a portion of the preferred stock securities of $27 million and $32 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. As part of this transaction, the insurance underwriting subsidiaries were required to purchase from PEPS I additional fixed-maturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments, as they are requested. In 2004 and 2003, Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries funded $13 million and $20 million of commitments, respectively. Beginning in July 2004, Aon Parent is funding all future commitments. Aon Parent funded $7 million of commitments in 2004. As of December 31, 2004, these unfunded commitments amounted to $60 million. These commitments have specific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments. Based on the rating agencies' downgrades in October 2002 on Aon's senior debt, credit support arrangements were put in place in January 2003, whereby $100 million of cash from Combined Insurance Company of America (CICA), one of Aon's underwriting subsidiaries, was pledged as collateral for these commitments. During second quarter 2004, the balance of the collateral, $59 million, was dividended to Aon Parent. Given the current ratings of Aon, CICA and Virginia Surety Corporation, another of Aon's underwriting subsidiaries, the collateral was no longer required. As such, the collateral account was liquidated in December 2004 and the funds were returned to Aon's operating cash. To achieve the benefits of the securitization, Aon gave up all future voting interests in and control over the limited partnership interests sold to PEPS I and has no voting interest, control or significant influence over the business activities of PEPS I. Aon has obtained a true sale/non-consolidation opinion from qualified external legal counsel. PEPS I holds limited partnership investments. The legal documents that established PEPS I specify the actions that PEPS I and the servicer will undertake when PEPS I is required to make a voting decision (due to the general partner of a limited partnership calling for the vote of limited partners or proxy voting on a money market fund that PEPS I is invested in). Additionally, the legal documents contain specific instructions regarding actions to be taken if PEPS I receives (or has the ability to receive) distributions of investments held by limited partnerships in which it is invested. In instances where the general partner of a given investment may distribute underlying invested company shares to the limited partners (such as PEPS I), the legal documents that establish PEPS I outline specific disposal instructions. Throughout the life of PEPS I, at least 10% of the beneficial interests will be held by parties other than Aon, its affiliates, or its agents. This 10% threshold is accomplished through the first tranche notes outstanding to unaffiliated third party investors. 98 PEPS I invests cash collected from the limited partnerships pending distribution to holders of beneficial interests. PEPS I invests only in relatively risk free investments with maturities no later than an expected distribution date. All holders of the beneficial interests have the right to pledge or exchange (sell), without any constraints, the beneficial interests that they hold. As such, there are no conditions that constrain the beneficial interest holders from pledging or exchanging their beneficial interest(s) and provide the transferor with more than a trivial benefit. Other Securities on deposit for regulatory authorities as required by law, all relating to the insurance underwriting subsidiaries, amounted to $606 million at December 31, 2004 and $477 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Aon had $173 million and $136 million, respectively, of non-income producing investments, which excludes derivatives that are marked to market through the income statement, as well as private equity investments carried on the equity method, held for at least twelve months, that have not declared dividends during 2004 and 2003. 99 7. Debt and Lease Commitments Notes Payable The following is a summary of outstanding notes payable: (millions) As of December 31, 2004 2003 8.205% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, due January 2027 $ 726 $ 726 3.5% convertible debt securities, due November 2012 297 296 6.2% debt securities, due January 2007 (1) 250 250 8.65% debt securities, due May 2005 250 250 7.375% debt securities, due December 2012 223 223 6.9% debt securities, due July 2004 — 216 6.3% debt securities, due January 2004 — 89 Euro credit facility 334 — Notes payable, due in varying installments, with interest at 2.5% to 15.91% 35 45 Total notes payable $ 2,115 $ 2,095 (1)Rate increased to 6.7% in January 2003 and 6.95% in January 2005. Aon created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust, for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities. Aon received cash and an investment in 100% of the common equity of Aon Capital A by issuing 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (subordinated debt) to Aon Capital A. Aon has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and was required to deconsolidate Aon Capital A upon the adoption of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003. As a result of the deconsolidation, Aon increased its notes payable for the subordinated debt by $726 million. See Note 10, ""Redeemable Preferred Stock, Capital Securities and Stockholders' Equity"" for further information on Aon Capital A. In 2002, Aon completed a private offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% convertible senior debentures due in 2012. The net proceeds from this offering were $296 million. The debentures are unsecured obligations and are convertible into Aon common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately $21.475 per common share under certain circumstances including (1) during any fiscal quarter, if the closing price of Aon's common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price (i.e. $25.77) for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter, or (2) subject to certain exceptions, during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures for each day of the ten trading day period was less than 95% of the product of the closing sale price of Aon's common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of the debentures. Aon will be required to pay additional contingent interest, beginning November 15, 2007, if the trading price of the debentures for each of the five trading days immediately preceding the first day of the six month interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the par value of the debentures. Aon has reserved approximately 14 million shares for the potential conversion of these debentures. Beginning November 19, 2007, Aon may redeem any of the debentures at an initial redemption price of 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest. The debentures were sold to qualified institutional buyers. In 2001, Aon issued $250 million of 6.2% debt securities due January 2007. The interest rate on these debt securities is subject to adjustment in the event that Aon's credit ratings change. Due to ratings downgrades during 2002 and 2004, the interest rate on the 6.2% debt securities was increased to 6.7% effective January 2003, and 6.95% effective January 2005. In 2001, certain of Aon's European subsidiaries entered into a committed bank credit facility under which they could borrow up to €500 million. Both the 364-day and five year portion of the facility were 100 for €250 million. At December 31, 2004, Aon had borrowed €250 million ($334 million) under the five year portion of the facility, which is classified as notes payable in the consolidated statements of financial position. At December 31, 2003, Aon had borrowed €38 million ($48 million) under the 364-day portion of the facility, which is included in short-term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial position. The 364-day portion of the facility expired in 2004 and was not renewed. In February 2005, Aon replaced this facility with a new €650 million multi-currency revolving loan credit facility. The new facility includes a €325 million three-year revolving loan facility and a €325 million five-year revolving loan facility. Commitment fees of 20 and 22 basis points are payable on the unused portion of the three-and five-year facility, respectively. Aon has guaranteed the obligations of its subsidiaries with respect to this new facility. At December 31, 2004, Aon had a $775 million unused U.S. committed bank credit facility to support commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. The three-year portion of the facility was for $437.5 million, while the 364-day portion of the facility was for $337.5 million. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2004 or 2003. In February 2005, Aon replaced both portions of the facility with a new $600 million three-year revolving credit facility. This facility permits the issuance of up to $150 million in letters of credit. The U.S. facility is guaranteed by Aon Group, Inc., a subsidiary of Aon which owns most of the brokerage and consulting operations. Any subsidiary guarantees will terminate after the unsecured credit ratings of Aon by Standard & Poor's and Moody's reach A-and A3 (with stable outlook) or better, respectively. Based on Aon's current credit ratings, commitment fees of 15 basis points are payable on the unused portion of the facility. For both the new U.S. and Euro facilities, Aon is required to maintain consolidated net worth, as defined, of at least $2.5 billion, a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated interest expense of 4 to 1 and a ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA of not greater than 3 to 1. In addition, the U.S. facility contains a covenant pertaining to a minimum guarantor EBITDA, and the Euro facility also requires mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds of certain asset sales. Aon also has other foreign facilities available, which include a 364-day £45 million facility and a Canadian dollar 10 million facility, both of which expire in September 2005, and a €20 million facility, which has no set expiration date. Outstanding debt securities, including Aon Capital A's, are not redeemable by Aon prior to maturity except for the 3.5% convertible debt securities, which are redeemable by Aon beginning in 2007. There are no sinking fund provisions. Interest is payable semi-annually on most debt securities. Repayments of notes payable are $592 million, $7 million, $256 million, $1 million and $1 million in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Information related to notes payable and short-term borrowings is as follows: Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Interest paid (millions) $ 147 $ 103 $ 123 Weighted-average interest rates — short-term borrowings 3.5 % 2.6 % 3.3 % Lease Commitments Aon has noncancelable operating leases for certain office space, equipment and automobiles. Rental expense for operating leases amounted to $387 million in 2004, $381 million in 2003 and $289 million in 2002. 101 At December 31, 2004, future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year, net of sub-lease rental income, most of which pertain to real estate leases, are as follows: (millions) 2005 $ 345 2006 301 2007 254 2008 228 2009 175 Later years 777 Total minimum payments required $ 2,080 102 8. Income Taxes Aon and its principal domestic subsidiaries are included in a consolidated life-nonlife federal income tax return. Aon's international subsidiaries file various income tax returns in their jurisdictions. Income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest and the provision for income tax consist of the following: (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest: U.S. $ 115 $ 366 $ 202 International 765 765 638 Total $ 880 $ 1,131 $ 840 Provision for income tax: Current: Federal $ 123 $ 89 $ 46 International 278 215 195 State 34 43 14 Total current 435 347 255 Deferred (credit): Federal (140 ) 45 28 International 14 18 21 State (6 ) 9 6 Total deferred (132 ) 72 55 Provision for income tax $ 303 $ 419 $ 310 Income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest shown above is based on the location of the corporate unit to which such earnings are attributable. However, because such earnings in some cases may be subject to taxation in more than one country, the income tax provision shown above as U.S. or International does not correspond to the geographic attribution of the earnings. During 2003 and 2002, Aon's consolidated statements of income reflect a tax benefit of $22 million and $24 million, respectively, on the 8.205% Capital Securities (see Note 10). As a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003, Aon was required to deconsolidate the Capital Securities, which was completely offset by an increase in notes payable. In 2004, interest expense on these notes payable was reported as a part of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income, and the related tax benefit is included in the provision for income tax. 103 A reconciliation of the income tax provisions based on the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to the provisions reflected in the consolidated financial statements is as follows: Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2.1 3.0 1.6 Taxes on international operations (0.8 ) (2.3 ) (2.3 ) Basis difference in businesses sold (3.6 ) — — Other — net 1.7 1.3 2.7 Effective tax rate 34.4 % 37.0 % 37.0 % Significant components of Aon's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: (millions) As of December 31, 2004 2003 Deferred tax assets: Employee benefit plans $ 548 $ 469 Unearned and advanced premiums and contract fees 168 160 Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 66 88 Certain purchase accounting and special charges 90 28 Unrealized foreign exchange losses — 16 Other 43 37 915 798 Valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (41 ) (34 ) Total 874 764 Deferred tax liabilities: Policy acquisition costs (210 ) (189 ) Unrealized investment gains (65 ) (45 ) Unrealized foreign exchange gains (59 ) — Other (28 ) (68 ) Total (362 ) (302 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 512 $ 462 Valuation allowances have been established primarily with regard to the tax benefits of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. To the extent valuation allowances were provided through acquisition accounting, tax benefits recognized for such items would reduce goodwill. The valuation allowances changed to $41 million in 2004 from $34 million in 2003, attributable largely to the assessment of the potential future benefit of certain international net operating loss carryforwards. Although future earnings cannot be predicted with certainty, management currently believes that realization of the net deferred tax asset is more likely than not. U.S. deferred income taxes are provided on unremitted foreign earnings except those that are considered permanently reinvested, which at December 31, 2004 amounted to approximately $300 million. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if all such earnings were remitted to the United States. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) introduced a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate, in 2004 or 2005, certain foreign earnings at an effective tax rate of 5.25%. Aon has not yet completed its evaluation of the provision, and may postpone any ultimate determination regarding its application until the fourth quarter of 2005. Whether Aon ultimately takes advantage of the incentive depends on many factors, including the review of U.S. Treasury Department guidance, and the adoption of a reinvestment plan as required by 104 the legislation. Based on our analysis to date, however, it is reasonably possible that we may repatriate pursuant to the Act between $0 and $100 million, with the respective tax liability ranging from $0 to $5 million. At December 31, 2004, Aon had domestic federal operating loss carryforwards of $40 million which will expire at various dates from 2005 to 2021, state operating loss carryforwards of $359 million which will expire at various dates from 2005 to 2024, and foreign operating loss carryforwards of $94 million, which expire at various dates. Prior to 1984, life insurance companies were required to accumulate certain untaxed amounts in a memorandum ""policyholders' surplus account."" Under the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the ""policyholders' surplus account"" balances were ""capped"" at December 31, 1983, and the balances will be taxed only to the extent distributed to stockholders or when they exceed certain prescribed limits. As of December 31, 2004, the combined ""policyholders' surplus account"" of Aon's life insurance subsidiaries is approximately $363 million. Aon's life insurance subsidiaries do not intend to make any taxable distributions or exceed the prescribed limits in the foreseeable future; therefore, no income tax provision has been made. However, if such taxes were assessed, the amount of taxes payable would be approximately $127 million. The Act suspends for 2005 and 2006 the application of the rules imposing income tax on distributions from the policyholders' surplus account of a life insurance company. Aon is evaluating the application of this provision to its policyholders' surplus balances. The amount of income taxes paid in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $413 million, $296 million and $238 million, respectively. 105 9. Reinsurance and Claim Reserves Aon's insurance subsidiaries are involved in both the cession and assumption of reinsurance with other companies. Aon's reinsurance consists primarily of short-duration contracts that are entered into with the captive insurance operations of numerous automobile dealerships and insurers, certain newer accident and health initiatives, as well as certain property casualty lines. Aon's insurance subsidiaries remain liable to the extent that the reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations. A summary of reinsurance activity is as follows: (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Ceded premiums earned $ 1,379 $ 1,261 $ 1,190 Ceded premiums written 1,226 1,307 1,371 Assumed premiums earned 336 366 493 Assumed premiums written 336 382 533 Ceded benefits to policyholders 804 796 703 Activity in the liability for policy and contract claims is summarized as follows: (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Liabilities at beginning of year $ 751 $ 529 $ 455 Incurred losses: Current year 1,435 1,319 1,174 Prior years (1) (1) 87 86 Total 1,434 1,406 1,260 Payment of claims: Current year (915) (798) (834) Prior years (445) (386) (352) Total (1,360) (1,184) (1,186) Liabilities at end of year (net of reinsurance recoverables: 2004 — $1,029; 2003 — $858; 2002 — $722) $ 825 $ 751 $ 529 (1)For 2003 and 2002, prior years' incurred losses primarily represent losses from business produced by NPS. NPS stopped initiating any new business in mid-2002. 106 10. Redeemable Preferred Stock, Capital Securities and Stockholders' Equity Redeemable Preferred Stock At December 31, 2004, one million shares of redeemable preferred stock were outstanding. Dividends are cumulative at an annual rate of $2.55 per share. These shares are redeemable at the option of Aon or the holders, in whole or in part, at $50.00 per share beginning one year after the death of both of the original owners, which occurred in September 2004. Aon has not received a notice of intent to redeem these shares, nor does Aon currently intend to redeem these shares. Capital Securities Aon Capital A is a wholly-owned statutory business trust created for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (Capital Securities). The sole asset of Aon Capital A is the $726 million aggregate principal amount of Aon's 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (subordinated debt) due January 1, 2027. The back-up guarantees, in the aggregate, provide a full and unconditional guarantee of Aon Capital A's obligations under the Capital Securities. Aon Capital A issued $800 million of 8.205% capital securities in January 1997. The proceeds from the issuance of the Capital Securities were used to finance a portion of the A&A acquisition. Aon received $800 million in cash and a $24 million investment in 100% of the common equity of Aon Capital A by issuing $824 million of subordinated debt. During 2002, approximately $98 million (face value) of the Capital Securities were repurchased on the open market and were used to retire $98 million of the debt to Aon Capital A. The Capital Securities are subject to mandatory redemption on January 1, 2027 (upon the maturity of the subordinated debt) or are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the option of Aon (through its prepayment of the subordinated debt) upon the occurrence of certain events. Interest is payable semi-annually on the Capital Securities. Aon has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and was required to deconsolidate the Trust upon the adoption of FIN 46 on December 31, 2003, which was completely offset by an increase in notes payable. Prior to the deconsolidation of Aon Capital A, the after-tax interest incurred on the Capital Securities was reported as minority interest in the consolidated statements of income. Beginning in 2004, interest expense on these notes payable was reported as part of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. There was no effect on net income or consolidated stockholders' equity as a result of this deconsolidation (prior periods were not restated). Common Stock In 2004, Aon did not repurchase any of its common stock. In 2003 and 2002, Aon repurchased 0.1 million and 0.4 million shares, respectively. In 2004, Aon issued 2.0 million new shares of common stock for employee benefit plans and 757,000 shares in connection with the employee stock purchase plan. In connection with the acquisition of two entities controlled by Aon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2001, Aon obtained approximately 22.4 million shares of its common stock. These treasury shares are restricted as to their reissuance. 107 Dividends A summary of dividends paid is as follows: (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Redeemable preferred stock $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 Common stock 189 187 230 Total dividends paid $ 192 $ 190 $ 233 Statutory Capital and Surplus Generally, the capital and surplus of Aon's insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to the parent company is limited to the amount that the insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus exceeds minimum statutory capital requirements; however, payments of the amounts as dividends in excess of $284 million may be subject to approval by regulatory authorities. See Note 8 for possible tax effects of distributions made out of untaxed earnings. Net statutory income (loss) of the insurance subsidiaries is summarized as follows: (millions) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Accident & Health and Life $ 193 $ 95 $ (13) Warranty, Credit and Property & Casualty 123 (21) (64) Statutory capital and surplus of the insurance subsidiaries are summarized as follows: (millions) As of December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Accident & Health and Life $ 840 $ 700 $ 537 Warranty, Credit and Property & Casualty 676 611 448 108 11. Employee Benefits Savings and Profit Sharing Plans Aon subsidiaries maintain savings plans with both contributory and non-contributory accounts for the benefit of U.S. salaried and commissioned employees. The non-contributory accounts were established in lieu of a defined pension benefit in 2004 for certain U.S. employees hired after December 31, 2003. Provisions made for these plans were $43 million, $54 million and $48 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Aon sponsors defined benefit pension and postretirement health and welfare plans that provide retirement, medical and life insurance benefits. The postretirement healthcare plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance and pension plans are noncontributory. Effective January 1, 2004, the U.S. pension plans were closed to new employees. In 1999, Aon's U.K. pension plans became closed to new employees. All new employees became participants in a defined contribution plan. The provisions for the defined contribution plan were $20 million, $19 million and $14 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, Aon changed its U.S. retiree medical program. All future post-65 retirees (current active employees and current retirees under age 65) will no longer be offered the Aon Medicare Supplement plan upon attainment of age 65. Instead, future post-65 retirees will be offered plans through individual insured arrangements. Aon may subsidize $50 per month per individual for these plans. The impact of this change was a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $12 million. This amount is being amortized over a ten-year period. U.S. Pension and Other Benefit Plans The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in obligations and fair value of assets for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 and a statement of the funded status as of 109 December 31, 2004 and 2003, for both qualified and nonqualified plans. The measurement date for the U.S. plans is November 30.

In 2004, plans with a projected benefit obligation (PBO) and an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $1.5 billion, an ABO of $1.4 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $1.0 billion. In 2003, plans with a PBO and ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $1.3 billion, an ABO of $1.2 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $0.9 billion. 110 The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit cost for the plans for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: (millions) Pension Benefits 2004 2003 2002 Service cost $ 67 $ 52 $ 46 Interest cost 85 77 72 Expected return on plan assets (92 ) (78 ) (108 ) Amortization of prior-service cost (2 ) (2 ) (2 ) Amortization of net loss 22 11 2 Net periodic benefit cost $ 80 $ 60 $ 10 (millions) Other Benefits 2004 2003 2002 Service cost $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 Interest cost 4 5 5 Amortization of prior-service cost (1 ) — — Amortization of net gain — — (1 ) Net periodic benefit cost $ 6 $ 8 $ 7 The weighted-average assumptions used to determine future U.S. benefit obligations are as follows: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2004 2003 2004 2003 Discount rate 6.0 % 6.25 % 6.0 % 6.25 % Rate of compensation increase 3.5 3.5 — — The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the U.S. net periodic benefit cost for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Discount rate 6.25 % 7.0 % 7.5 % 6.25 % 7.0 % 7.5 % Expected return on plan assets 8.5 8.5 10.25 — — — Rate of compensation increase 3.5 3.5 4.0 — 3.5 4.0 Expected Return on Plan Assets To determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the historical performance, investment community forecasts and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each asset class used by the plans. The expected returns for each asset class are weighted by the target allocations of the plans. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used to determine pension expense is 8.5%. 111 Plan Assets Aon's U.S. pension plan asset allocation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: Fair Value of Plan Assets Allocation Range Target Allocation Asset Class 2004 2003 Equities 50 – 80 % 70% 74 % 61 % Domestic equities 40 – 70 40 45 32 International equities 5 – 15 10 11 7 Limited partnerships and other 2.5 – 20 10 11 15 Real estate and REITs 5 – 15 10 4 3 Aon common stock 0 – 5 0 3 4 Debt securities 20 – 50 30 26 39 Fixed maturities 20 – 50 30 23 24 Invested cash 0 – 2 0 3 15 Total 100 % 100 % Pension plan assets include Aon common stock in the amounts of $30 million and $34 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Dividends from Aon stock received by the plan in 2004 and 2003 were $0.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Invested cash as of the plan measurement date in 2003 included an amount in transit of $100 million. Investment Policy and Strategy The investment policy, as established by the Aon Pension Plan Investment Committee, seeks reasonable asset growth at prudent risk levels within target allocations. Plan assets are invested within the asset allocation target ranges shown above. Aon believes that plan assets are well-diversified and are of appropriate quality. Asset allocation target ranges are reviewed quarterly and re-balanced to within policy target allocations. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually, and revised, as deemed appropriate by the Aon Pension Plan Investment Committee. Aon's U.S. other benefit plan assets of $8 million at both December 31, 2004 and 2003 were invested in money market instruments. Cash Flows Contributions Based on current assumptions, Aon expects to contribute $47 million to U.S. pension plans during 2005 to satisfy minimum funding requirements and $7 million to fund other postretirement benefit plans during 2005. 112 Estimated Future Benefit Payments Estimated future benefit payments for U.S. plans are as follows at December 31, 2004: (millions) Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2005 $ 60 $ 7 2006 62 7 2007 66 7 2008 70 7 2009 75 7 2010 — 2014 485 37 Assumptions for Other Postretirement Benefits Assumed health care cost trend rates at December 31: 2004 2003 Assumed healthcare cost trend rate 10.5 % 11.0 % Ultimate trend rate 5.5 % 5.5 % Year that the ultimate trend rate is reached 2014 2014 Aon's liability for future plan cost increase for pre-65 and Medical Supplement plan coverage is limited to 5% per annum. Because of this cap, net employer trend rates for these plans are effectively limited to 5% per year in the future. The $50 per month subsidy for future post-65 retirees is assumed not to increase in future years. Therefore, there is no employer trend for future post-65 retirees. As a result, a 1% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates has no effect on the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement healthcare benefit cost or on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the measurement period ended in 2004. Prescription Drug Subsidy The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law in December 2003. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Aon has determined that the benefits provided by its plan are not actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Accordingly, Aon has not recognized any benefit associated with the subsidy. International Pension Plans The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the benefit obligations and fair value of assets for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the funded status as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, for material international pension plans, which are located in the U.K. 113 and The Netherlands. The measurement dates for these plans are September 30 and December 31, respectively.

In 2004, plans with a PBO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $3.8 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $2.7 billion, and plans with an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had an ABO of $3.0 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $2.4 billion. In 2003, plans with a PBO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $3.3 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $2.2 billion, and plans with an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had an ABO of $2.7 billion and plan assets with a fair value of $2.0 billion. 114 The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit cost for the international plans for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: (millions) Pension Benefits 2004 2003 2002 Service cost $ 64 $ 51 $ 45 Interest cost 185 152 133 Expected return on plan assets (165 ) (134 ) (163 ) Amortization of net loss 70 58 31 Net periodic benefit cost $ 154 $ 127 $ 46 The range of weighted-average assumptions used to determine the international benefit obligations are as follows: (millions) Pension Benefits 2004 2003 Discount rate 4.5 – 5.6 % 5.25 – 5.5 % Rate of compensation increase 2.0 – 4.25 2.0 – 5.5 The range of weighted-average assumptions used to determine the international net periodic benefit costs for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Discount rate 5.25 – 5.5 % 5.5 – 5.75 % 6.25 – 7.0 % Expected return on plan assets 6.0 – 7.25 6.0 – 7.5 6.0 – 9.5 Rate of compensation increase 2.0 – 5.5 3.75 – 4.0 4.0 Expected Return on Plan Assets To determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the historical performance, investment community forecasts and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each asset class used by the plans. The expected returns for each asset class are weighted by the target allocations of the plans. The range of expected long-term rate of return assumption used to determine pension expense is 6.0% to 7.25%. Plan Assets Aon's international pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: Fair Value of Plan Assets Allocation Range Target Allocation Asset Class 2004 2003 Equities 45 – 75 % 61% 61 % 62 % Domestic equities — — International equities 57 60 Real estate 4 2 Debt securities 25 – 55 39 39 38 Fixed maturities 37 37 Invested cash 2 1 Total 100 % 100 % 115 Investment Policy and Strategy The investment policies for international plans are established by the local pension plan trustees and seek to maintain the plans' ability to meet liabilities and to comply with local minimum funding requirements. Plan assets are invested, within asset allocation ranges as shown above, in diversified portfolios that provide adequate levels of return at an acceptable level of risk. The investment policies are reviewed at least annually, and revised, as deemed appropriate to ensure that the objectives are being met. Cash Flows Contributions Based on current assumptions, Aon expects to contribute $155 million to its international pension plans during 2005 to satisfy minimum funding requirements. Estimated Future Benefit Payments Estimated future pension benefit payments for international plans are as follows at December 31, 2004: (millions) 2005 $ 96 2006 101 2007 106 2008 120 2009 125 2010-2014 787 116 12. Stock Compensation Plans Aon's Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The annual rate at which awards are granted each year is based upon financial and competitive business conditions. The number of shares authorized to be issued under the new plan is equal to 18% of the number of common shares outstanding. Stock Awards Aon has historically granted stock awards in the form of restricted stock units. Generally, employees are required to complete three continuous years of service before stock awards begin to vest in increments until the completion of a 10-year period of continuous employment. In 2003 and 2002, a large number of stock awards were granted that vest annually over five years, with the initial vesting occurring after one year of continuous service. In 2004, a large number of stock awards were granted that will not vest until five years after the date of grant. For most employees, beginning in 2005, individual incentive compensation over $50,000 will partially be paid in restricted stock units, which will vest ratably over three years. In general, stock awards are issued as they become vested. In certain circumstances, an employee can elect to defer the receipt of vested shares to a later date. With certain limited exceptions, any break in continuous employment will cause forfeiture of all unvested awards. The compensation cost associated with each stock award is deferred and amortized over the period of continuous employment using the straight-line method. At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the number of shares available for stock awards is included with options available for grant.

Generally, employees are required to complete two continuous years of service before the options begin to vest in increments until the completion of a 4-year period of continuous employment. For all grants made prior to an amendment to the former stock option plan in 2000, employees were required to complete three continuous years of service before the options began to vest in increments until the completion of a 6-year period of continuous employment. 117 A summary of Aon's stock option and related information is as follows: (shares in thousands) Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Beginning outstanding 31,627 $ 29 24,478 $ 32 21,298 $ 32 Granted 5,233 27 9,226 20 5,552 34 Exercised (475 ) 23 (13 ) 24 (877 ) 20 Canceled (2,197 ) 29 (2,064 ) 27 (1,495 ) 33 Ending outstanding 34,188 $ 29 31,627 $ 29 24,478 $ 32 Exercisable at end of year 15,060 $ 32 9,574 $ 32 5,308 $ 30 Options available for grant 11,885 15,742 22,771 A summary of options outstanding and exercisable is as follows: (Shares in thousands) As of December 31, 2004 Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Exercise Prices Shares Outstanding Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (years) Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares Exercisable Weighted- Average Exercise Price $14.92 — $19.30 676 7.77 $ 16.83 232 $ 16.86 19.45 — 19.70 5,660 8.21 19.70 12 19.52 19.76 — 23.94 6,881 6.39 22.98 4,177 23.91 23.95 — 27.16 5,045 9.35 26.89 87 26.96 27.34 — 32.53 5,127 5.27 31.38 4,019 31.14 32.64 — 36.88 7,677 6.71 36.00 3,849 35.71 37.13 — 49.29 3,122 3.74 43.28 2,684 43.28 $14.92 — $49.29 34,188 6.82 $ 28.93 15,060 $ 32.21 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Aon has an employee stock purchase plan that provides for the purchase of a maximum of 7.5 million shares of Aon's common stock by eligible U.S. employees. Under the plan, shares of Aon's common stock may be purchased at 3-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or the last day of each 3-month period. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, 754,000 shares, 734,000 shares, and 312,000 shares, respectively, were issued to employees under the plan. In first quarter 2002, the plan was temporarily suspended and was reactivated as of January 1, 2003. There was no compensation expense associated with this plan. 118 13. Financial Instruments Financial Risk Management Aon is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity security prices. To manage the risk related to these exposures, Aon enters into various derivative transactions. The derivatives have the effect of reducing Aon's market risks by creating offsetting market exposures. Aon does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses. Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. The credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to Aon. Aon has limited its credit risk by using master netting agreements, entering into non-exchange-traded derivatives with highly rated major financial institutions and by using exchange-traded instruments. Aon closely monitors the credit-worthiness of, and exposure to, its counterparties and considers its credit risk to be minimal. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Aon placed cash and securities relating to these derivative contracts in escrow amounting to $5 million and $4 million, respectively. Accounting Policy for Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at fair value. Unless otherwise noted, derivative instruments with a positive fair value are reported in other receivables and derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Where Aon has entered into master netting agreements with counterparties, the derivative positions are netted by program and are reported accordingly in other receivables or other liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized immediately in earnings, unless the derivative is designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting. FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, identifies three hedging relationships where a derivative (hedging instrument) may qualify for hedge accounting: (i) a hedge of the change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or firm commitment (""fair value hedge""), (ii) a hedge of the variability in cash flows from a recognized variable-rate asset or liability or forecasted transaction (""cash flow hedge""), and (iii) a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary (""net investment hedge""). Under hedge accounting, recognition of derivative gains and losses can be matched in the same period with that of the hedged exposure and thereby minimize earnings volatility. In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as either a fair value, cash flow, or a net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation will include a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, Aon's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, and the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Aon assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges at the end of each quarter. For a fair value hedge, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are both recognized currently in earnings. For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in fair value of a hedging instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) and subsequently reclassified to income when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash 119 flow hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. For a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in other comprehensive income (""OCI"") as part of the cumulative translation adjustment while the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as an accounting hedge (""economic hedge"") are recorded in either investment income or general expenses (depending on the hedged exposure) in the current period's consolidated statements of income. Aon discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, (2) it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows, (3) a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in the time period described in the hedge documentation, (4) the hedged item matures or is sold, or (5) management elects to discontinue hedge accounting voluntarily. When hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as a fair value hedge, Aon will continue to carry the derivative in the consolidated statements of financial position at its fair value, recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative in current-period earnings, cease to adjust the hedged asset or liability for changes in its fair value, and begin to amortize the hedged item's cumulative basis adjustment into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item using a method that approximates the level-yield method. When hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge, Aon will continue to carry the derivative in the consolidated statements of financial position at its fair value, recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative in current-period earnings, and continue to defer the derivative gain or loss in accumulated OCI until the hedged forecasted transaction affect earnings. If the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring in the time period described in the hedge documentation or within a two month period of time thereafter, the deferred derivative gain or loss would be reclassified immediately to earnings. Foreign Exchange Risk Management Certain of Aon's foreign brokerage subsidiaries, primarily in the U.K., receive revenues in currencies (primarily in U.S. dollars) that differ from their functional currencies. The foreign subsidiary's functional currency revenue will fluctuate as the currency exchange rates change. To reduce this variability, Aon uses foreign exchange forwards and options to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted revenue for up to a maximum of three years in the future. Aon has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges of its forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. As of December 31, 2004, a $73 million pretax gain has been deferred to OCI, $49 million of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings as an adjustment to general expenses in 2005. Deferred gains or losses will be reclassified from OCI to general expenses when the hedged revenue is recognized. This hedge had no material ineffectiveness in 2004. Aon uses over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of Aon's foreign operations. These derivatives are not afforded hedge accounting as defined by Statement No. 133. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Aon also uses foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denominated inter-company notes. These derivatives were not designated as a hedge and changes in their fair value were recorded in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Aon also uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of its net investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2004, currency forwards with a notional amount of $84 million were designated as hedges of primarily Canadian dollar, British pound, and Australian dollar denominated 120 net investments. In 2004, this hedge had no ineffectiveness and $16 million of derivative losses related to this hedge were recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account. There were no net investment hedges in 2003. Interest Rate Risk Management Aon uses futures contracts and purchased options on futures contracts to reduce the price volatility of its fixed-maturity portfolio. Derivatives designated as hedging specific fixed-income securities are accounted for as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are recorded in investment income. Aon occasionally enters into receive-fixed-pay-floating interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate notes. The interest rate swaps qualify as fair value hedges and have no ineffectiveness because their critical terms (e.g., amount, maturity date) match those of the hedged debt. Realized gains and losses on swaps qualified as hedges are deferred and reported as adjustments of the cost basis of the hedged items and are being amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged items. Aon issued fixed-rate notes in May 2000. Aon purchased options on interest rate swaps to hedge against a change in interest rates prior to the issuance of the fixed-rate notes. These options qualified as a hedge of an anticipated transaction under pre-Statement No. 133 accounting guidance and related gains were deferred and are being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. Upon the adoption of Statement No. 133, pretax deferred gains of $5 million were reclassified to OCI. At December 31, 2004, $1 million remains in OCI, of which all is expected to offset interest expense in 2005. Aon enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements and uses exchange-traded futures and options to limit its net exposure to decreasing short-term interest rates, primarily relating to U.S. dollar denominated brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the U.S. and U.K. These derivatives were not designated as a hedge and changes in their fair value were recorded in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. In 2004, receive-fixed-pay-floating interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate risk of a portion of Aon's U.S. dollar denominated brokerage funds held on behalf of clients. Changes in the fair value of the swaps were recorded in OCI and will be reclassified to earnings as an adjustment to investment income over the term of the swap. This hedge had no ineffectiveness in 2004 and the amounts deferred in OCI at year-end were immaterial. Equity Price Risk Management Aon sells futures contracts and purchases options to reduce the price volatility of its equity securities portfolio and equity securities it owns indirectly through limited partnership investments. These derivatives were not designated as a hedge and changes in their fair value were recorded in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) Excluding PEPS I Certain of Aon's subsidiaries make short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) to businesses to finance insurance premiums and then sell (""securitize"") the finance receivables through securitization transactions that meet the criteria for sale accounting in accordance with FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. These premium financing securitizations are accomplished by using special purpose entities which are considered qualifying SPEs (""QSPEs"") pursuant to Statement No. 140 and FIN 46, and commercial 121 paper multi-seller, non-qualified bank conduits (SPEs). Statement No. 140 provides that a QSPE should not be consolidated in the financial statements of a transferor or its affiliates (Aon's subsidiaries). Premium financing securitizations performed by Aon's U.S., U.K., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries use multi-seller non-qualified SPEs. By analyzing the qualitative and quantitative factors of the SPEs, Aon has determined that these subsidiaries are not the sponsor of the SPEs. Additionally, independent third parties (i) have made substantial equity investments in the SPEs, (ii) have voting control of the SPEs and (iii) generally have the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets of the SPEs. Based on these factors and before the adoption of FIN 46, Aon had determined that non-consolidation was the appropriate accounting treatment. With the adoption of FIN 46 as of December 31, 2003, Aon has determined that these subsidiaries do not have a significant variable interest in the multi-seller SPEs, and therefore, has concluded that non-consolidation continues to be appropriate. Aon or one of its QSPEs sells undivided interests in specified premium financing receivables to the independent SPEs. Under the terms of these agreements, new receivables increase the amounts available to securitize as collections (administered by Aon) reduce previously sold receivables. The amount advanced from third parties at any one time under the accounts receivable sales agreement was limited to a maximum of $2 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, $1.8 billion was advanced under these programs from the SPEs. Aon records at fair value the retained interest, which is included in insurance brokerage and consulting services receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. Aon recorded gains associated with the sale of receivables. When Aon calculated the gain, all fees related to this facility were included. The gains included in revenue in the consolidated statements of income, were $81 million, $69 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Aon retains servicing rights for sold receivables and a servicing fee is earned as income over the servicing period. The servicing fees are included in the gain/loss calculation. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of the servicing rights approximates the estimated costs to service the receivables, and accordingly, Aon has not recorded any servicing assets or liabilities related to this servicing activity. Aon estimates fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows from the servicing rights and servicing costs using discount rates that approximate current market rates and expected future prepayment rates. The SPEs bear the credit risks on the receivables, subject to limited recourse in the form of credit loss reserves, which Aon guarantees. Under the guarantee provisions, Aon's maximum cash requirement was $73 million and $75 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Aon renewed the U.S. and European facilities in December 2004 and in January 2005 eliminated the percentage guarantee for the European facility, replacing it with other collateral enhancements. In April 2005, the same will be done for the U.S. facility. Both facilities require Aon to maintain consolidated net worth, as defined, of at least $2.5 billion, and (1) consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated net interest of at least 4 to 1, and (2) consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of no more than 3 to 1. 122 Fair Value of Financial Instruments Accounting standards require the disclosure of fair values for certain financial instruments. The fair value disclosures are not intended to encompass the majority of policy liabilities, various other non-financial instruments or other intangible assets related to Aon's business. Accordingly, care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about Aon's business or financial condition based on the fair value disclosures. The basis for determining the fair value of financial instruments is discussed in Note 1. The carrying value and fair value of certain of Aon's financial instruments are as follows: (millions) As of December 31, 2004 2003 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Assets: Fixed maturities and equity securities $ 3,522 $ 3,522 $ 2,793 $ 2,793 Other investments 483 482 716 798 Cash, receivables and short-term investments 15,136 15,136 14,373 14,373 Derivatives 149 149 93 93 Liabilities: Deposit-type insurance contracts 18 18 58 58 Short-term borrowings, premium payables and general expenses 11,728 11,728 11,754 11,754 Notes payable 2,115 2,280 2,095 2,229 Derivatives 86 86 13 13 Guarantees and Indemnifications Aon provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others to allow Aon or others to complete a wide variety of business transactions. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Any anticipated amounts payable which are deemed to be probable and estimable are properly reflected in Aon's consolidated financial statements. Refer to ""Other Financial Instruments"" above for guarantees associated with Aon's premium financing securitizations. Guarantees associated with Aon's limited partnership securitization are disclosed in Note 6. Indemnities related to discontinued operations are disclosed in Note 5. Aon and its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $21 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. Amounts are accrued in the consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable. Aon has certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. Costs associated with these guarantees, to the extent estimable and probable, are provided in Aon's allowance for doubtful accounts. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $21 million at December 31, 2004. Aon expects that as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time. 123 14. Contingencies Aon and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. Aon has purchased errors and omissions (""E&O"") insurance and other appropriate insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant. On April 21, 2004, Aon received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York calling for the production of documents relating to Placement Service Agreements, Market Service Agreements and similar agreements under which insurance carriers pay compensation to Aon beyond standard commissions. The office subsequently issued several other requests for information to Aon as part of its inquiry into alleged practices in the insurance industry, including bid-rigging, fictitious quotes, ""tying,"" and ""steering"" of business. The departments of insurance or attorneys general of approximately 25 other states have also issued subpoenas or requested information regarding these and other issues. Aon is fully cooperating with all of these investigations. On March 4, 2005, Aon Corporation (""Aon"") and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the ""Company"") entered into an agreement (the ""Settlement Agreement"") with the Attorney General of the State of New York, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Illinois Attorney General and the Director of the Division of Insurance, Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (collectively, the ""State Agencies"") to resolve all the issues related to investigations conducted by the State Agencies. The material terms of the Settlement Agreement are as follows: The Company will pay $190 million into a fund (the ""Fund"") to be distributed to certain eligible policyholder clients. These payments are in full satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Settlement Agreement and the State Agencies have agreed not to impose any other financial obligation or liability on the Company related to the lawsuits. No portion of the payments by the Company is considered a fine or penalty. The Company will make payments into the Fund as follows: •On or before September 1, 2005, the Company shall pay $76 million into the Fund. •On or before September 1, 2006, the Company shall pay $76 million into the Fund. •On or before September 1, 2007, the Company shall pay $38 million into the Fund. The Fund, plus interest, will be used to compensate the Company's eligible policyholder clients according to procedures set out in the Settlement Agreement. No amount paid to the Fund will be returned to Aon under any circumstances. On or before June 30, 2005, the Company will calculate, in accordance with a formula approved by the State Agencies, the amount that each policyholder client is eligible to receive from the Fund. Clients eligible to participate in the Fund are those U.S. clients that engaged the Company to place, renew, consult on or service insurance with inception or renewal dates between January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2004 (the ""Relevant Period"") where such placement, renewal, consultation or servicing resulted in contingent commissions or overrides recorded by Aon during the Relevant Period (the ""Eligible Policyholders""). On or before June 30, 2005, the Company must send a notice to each Eligible Policyholder setting forth, among other things, the amount it will be paid from the Fund if it elects to participate (a 124 ""Participating Policyholder""). Participating Policyholders must tender a release of claims against the Company arising from acts, omissions, transactions or conduct that are the subject of the lawsuits. On November 30, 2005, September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2007, each Participating Policyholder shall receive from the Fund as much of that Participating Policyholder's aggregate share of the Fund as possible with the monies then available in the Fund. In the event that an Eligible Policyholder elects not to participate or otherwise does not respond by October 30, 2005 (a ""Non-Participating Policyholder""), that client's allocated share may be used by the Company to satisfy any pending or other claims asserted by clients relating to the issues in the Settlement Agreement. In no event shall a distribution be made from the Fund to any other client until all Participating Policyholders have been paid, nor shall total payments to any Non-Participating Policyholder exceed 80% of that policyholder's original allocated share. If any funds remain in the Fund as of October 1, 2007 such funds shall be distributed pro rata to the Participating Policyholders by November 1, 2007. In no event shall any of the amounts paid into the Fund be used to pay attorneys' fees. Also within 60 days of the date of the Settlement Agreement, the Company shall commence the implementation of certain business reforms, including agreeing not to accept contingent compensation as defined in the Settlement Agreement. The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, seek or accept indemnification pursuant to any insurance policy or other reimbursement with respect to any amounts payable under the Settlement Agreement. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 21, Interest on Receivables and Payables, the Company has discounted the payment stream associated with the settlement and recorded the present value of the liability and corresponding expense of $180 million in the financial statements as of December 31, 2004. The discount was determined using Aon's incremental borrowing rate. The Company did not discount the payment due on September 1, 2005. The settelment was considered fully tax deductible and is not treated as a permanent difference in the Company's tax calculation. Purported clients have also filed civil litigation against Aon and other companies under a variety of laws and legal theories relating to broker compensation practices and other issues under investigation by New York and other states. As previously reported, a putative class action styled Daniel v. Aon (Affinity) has been pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois since August 1999. On July 28, 2004, the Court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On March 9, 2005, the Court gave preliminary approval to a nationwide class action settlement within the $40 million reserve established in the fourth quarter of 2004. Beginning in June 2004, a number of other putative class actions have been filed against Aon and other companies by purported clients under a variety of legal theories, including state tort, contract, fiduciary duty, and statutory theories, and federal antitrust and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act theories. These actions are currently pending at early stages in state court in California and Florida and in federal court in Illinois, South Carolina and New Jersey. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of these cases, and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The outcomes of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time. Beginning in late October and early November 2004, several putative securities class actions have been filed against Aon in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Also beginning in late October and early November 2004, several putative ERISA class actions were filed against Aon in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of these cases, and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. 125 The outcomes of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time. In early February 2005 the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Labor regarding compensation arrangements in connection with clients' employee benefit plans. The Company is cooperating with the investigation. In July 2004, several subsidiaries of Aon were joined as defendants in an action in a U.K. court between British Petroleum (""BP"") and underwriters who subscribed to policies of insurance covering various offshore energy projects on which BP and its co-venturers have incurred losses of approximately $120 million. In the event BP does not prevail against its underwriters, BP might seek to hold Aon liable for all or part of this amount. BP has also asserted a claim against Aon for additional losses of approximately $88 million on the same projects for which there is a lack of cover as a result of an earlier settlement between BP and other underwriters who subscribed to the same policies of insurance. The proceedings are at an early stage. Aon intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The outcomes of these actions, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time. Although the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on Aon or its subsidiaries, on the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Aon. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. 126 15. Segment Information Aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services, Consulting, and Insurance Underwriting. A fourth segment, Corporate and Other, when aggregated with the operating segments and after the elimination of intersegment revenues, totals to the amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Certain segment information in prior periods' consolidated financial statements has been reclassified to reflect sold business reported as discontinued operations. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1, except that the disaggregated financial results have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which Aon senior management internally disaggregates financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operating decisions. Aon evaluates performance based on stand-alone operating segment income before income taxes and generally accounts for intersegment revenue as if the revenue were from third parties, that is, considered by management to be at current market prices. Revenues are generally attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues. Intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in computing consolidated revenues and income before tax. In 2004 and 2003, inter-segment revenues were eliminated. Prior to 2003, there were no material inter-segment revenues to be eliminated. Long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization are not material. Consolidated revenue by geographic area is as follows: (millions) Total United States United Kingdom Continent of Europe Rest of World Years ended December 31: 2004 $ 10,172 $ 5,248 $ 1,732 $ 1,719 $ 1,473 2003 9,718 5,198 1,756 1,469 1,295 2002 8,716 5,006 1,543 1,117 1,050 The Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment consists principally of Aon's retail, reinsurance and wholesale brokerage operations, as well as related insurance services, including underwriting management, captive insurance company management services, claims services, and premium financing. During 2004, Aon sold essentially all of its claim services businesses. The Consulting segment is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations. The operations of this segment provide a full range of human capital management services.

(2)Investments in subsidiaries include approximately $3.2 billion invested in countries outside of the United States, primarily denominated in the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. (3)Guarantees and Indemnifications Aon provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others to allow Aon or others to complete a wide variety of business transactions. The maximum potential amount of future payments represent the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Aon does not currently anticipate making future payments to any of its subsidiaries, or third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries, for these guarantees and indemnifications. A bank provides overdraft facilities for certain of Aon's foreign subsidiaries. Aon has guaranteed repayment of this facility in the unlikely event that the foreign subsidiaries are unable to repay. Aon has also issued guarantees and/or other letters of support for various bank lines, and various other credit facilities for certain of its foreign operations (including the Euro credit facility discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Aon's maximum potential liability with regard to these exposures was $344 million at December 31, 2004. Aon has a liability for its commitment to contribute $8 million to the Aon Memorial Fund to support the educational needs of the children of Aon employees who were victims of the September 11 attacks. Aon has guaranteed the obligations of one of its major Netherlands' subsidiaries through 2007. Management believes there is sufficient operating cash flow, liquidity and equity at this subsidiary to cover current obligations and future obligations as they come due. Aon has issued various other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at its international subsidiaries for $7 million. Aon expects that as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time. 134 SCHEDULE II Aon Corporation and Subsidiaries VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 Additions Description Balance at beginning of year Charged to cost and expenses Charged/ (credited) to other accounts (2) Deductions (1) Balance at end of year (millions) Year ended December 31, 2004 Allowance for doubtful accounts (deducted from insurance brokerage and consulting receivables) $ 88 $ 29 $ 1 $ (22 ) $ 96 Allowance for doubtful accounts (deducted from premiums and other) 99 1 — (6 ) 94 Year ended December 31, 2003 Allowance for doubtful accounts (deducted from insurance brokerage and consulting receivables) $ 79 $ 43 $ 9 $ (43 ) $ 88 Allowance for doubtful accounts (deducted from premiums and other) 98 2 — (1 ) 99 Year ended December 31, 2002 Allowance for doubtful accounts (deducted from insurance brokerage and consulting receivables) $ 93 $ 23 $ 2 $ (39 ) $ 79 Allowance for doubtful accounts (deducted from premiums and other) 94 7 — (3 ) 98 (1)Amounts deemed to be uncollectible.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Registrant has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the Registrant's financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2004, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Registrant have concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Registrant in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There were no significant changes in the Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Information regarding the Registrant's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Report and is incorporated by reference herein.

Such directors, executive officers and stockholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of such reports. Based solely upon our review of these reports, as well as written representations to the effect that no such other reports were required to be filed, Aon believes that all such SEC filing requirements were met during 2004, except as follows: (i) Michael O'Halleran filed one late report on Form 4 relating to a transfer of shares of common stock in the Aon Savings Plan; and (ii) Richard Ravin filed two late reports on Form 4, one relating to a transfer of shares of common stock in the Aon Savings Plan, and one relating to a transfer to a fund tracked in shares of common stock in the deferred compensation plan.

Under the UK Scheme, employees authorize Aon to deduct a specified amount from compensation each pay period for deposit into a savings account for a three-year term. If a participant's deductions continue through the last day of the term, the participant is credited with a tax-free cash bonus equal to 2.75 times the monthly payroll deduction. Participants may cease participation in the UK Scheme at any time. Participants are also granted options at the beginning of each savings period and may direct Aon to purchase or issue shares of Aon common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market value at the beginning of the period, utilizing the accumulated amounts in their account. Options may be exercised generally within six months after the last day of the term, or after death, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement. If a participant ceases to be employed by Aon for other reasons, or declines to purchase Aon common stock during any of the available purchase periods, the 141 participant's right to purchase shares of Aon common stock or accumulate additional payroll deductions lapses. The UK Scheme was approved by the Board of Directors in 1999. No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the UK Scheme has been made. As of December 31, 2004, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was zero. Aon Australia Share Plans The Aon Australia Share Plans (the ""Australia Plans"") provide employees of Aon and participating subsidiaries employed in Australia who have at least 12 months of continuous service an opportunity to purchase Aon common stock at a 15% discount from the market price through payroll deductions. Under the Australia Plans, each year eligible employees choose whether they wish to participate in the Exempt Plan or the Deferred Plan. Under the Exempt Plan, participants contribute $850 per annum. Shares purchased under the Exempt Plan must be held for three years from the date of purchase. Under the Deferred Plan, participants contribute an elected amount between $2,000 per annum and the lesser of 25% of salary or $30,000 per annum. Shares purchased under the Deferred Plan must be held for twelve months from the date of purchase. Participant contributions under both the Exempt Plan and the Deferred Plan are deducted ratably over all pay periods in the year and stock purchases are made for employees' accounts monthly on or about the 19th of the month. The Australia Plans commenced on June 1, 2002. No specific share authorization for the Australian Plans has been made. As of December 31, 2004, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was zero. Canada Share Save Plan The Canada Share Save Plan (""CSSP"") is one of the optional benefits under the Aon Flex program. Contributions to the CSSP are made through payroll deduction. The contributions are invested in Aon stock. As of December 31, 2004, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was zero. Aon MacDonagh Boland Group Limited Savings Related Share Option Scheme The Aon MacDonagh Boland Group Limited Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the ""Ireland Scheme"") is a save-as-you-earn employee stock purchase plan available solely to employees of Aon and participating subsidiaries employed in Ireland. Under the Ireland Scheme, eligible employees may sign a savings contract with Aon and a local bank authorizing Aon to deduct a specified amount from their compensation each pay period and deposit the deductions into a savings account for their benefit. Each savings contract has a three year term, and the last date of such term is defined as the ""Bonus Date."" If a participant's payroll deductions continue through the Bonus Date, the bank holding the savings contract pays the participant a tax-free cash bonus based on the amount of the participant's monthly payroll deductions. The bonus is equal to 2.0 times the monthly payroll deduction, which equates to an interest rate of 3.51% per year. Participants may cease participation in the Ireland Scheme and/or withdraw accumulated payroll deductions at any time; however, the participant would not be eligible to receive a bonus on withdrawn amounts and may be subject to taxes on amounts withdrawn prior to the Bonus Date. The Ireland Scheme was approved by the Board of Directors in 2000, but has not yet been implemented. No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the Ireland Scheme has been made. As of December 31, 2004, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was zero. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Netherlands) The Netherlands Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides employees of Aon and participating subsidiaries in the Netherlands the opportunity to purchase Aon common stock at a 15% discount. Contributions to this plan are made through payroll deduction. The maximum amount is not more than 15% of gross annual income with a maximum of US $10,000. As of December 31, 2004, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was 1,068. Aon Supplemental Savings Plan The Aon Supplemental Savings Plan (the ""Supplemental Plan"") was adopted by the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") in 1998. It is a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provides benefits to participants in the Aon Savings Plan whose employer matching contributions are limited because of IRS-imposed restrictions. Effective January 1, 2004, the Supplemental Plan provides additional matching benefits only to eligible employees in Aon Consulting's Human Resource Outsourcing Group (""HROG"") and such benefits represent the matching contributions that the eligible employees would have received under the Aon Savings Plan — 100% of the first 1% to 3% of compensation (the First Tier Match) and 75% of the next 4% to 6% of compensation (the Second Tier Match) — had compensation up to $500,000 been considered. Participants may elect to have Tier I allocations credited to their accounts as if invested in a money market account or as if invested in Aon common stock. Tier II allocations are maintained in an Aon common stock account unless the participant is age 55 or more. If so, the participant may elect to direct his or her allocation to the money market account. Amounts maintained in the Aon common stock account may not be moved to the money market account, regardless of the participant's age. Before the beginning of each plan year, an election may be made by any participant to transfer some or all of a participant's money market account to the Aon common stock account. All amounts credited to the Aon common stock account are credited with dividends and other investment returns as under the Aon Savings Plan fund. Effective January 1, 2004, no further matching contributions are available under this Supplemental Plan for non-HROG employees. Also effective January 1, 2004, the Supplemental Plan was amended to add a discretionary non-contributory company contribution for eligible employees hired on or after January 1, 2004 in connection with plan compensation above the IRS limits (and up to $500,000). The allocation of the company contribution and account balances will track the same 142 investment options as selected by the participant under a similar feature of the Aon Savings Plan, including the Aon common stock option. However, like the investment option under the Aon Savings Plan, there are no transfer restrictions. Aon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan The Aon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan was a plan established in 1989 as a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provided benefits to participants in the Aon Employee Stock Ownership Plan whose employer contributions were limited because of IRS-imposed restrictions. As of 1998, no additional amounts have been credited to participant accounts, although account balances are maintained for participants, and credited with dividends, until distribution is required under the plan. Distributions are made solely in Aon common stock. No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the plan has been made. (6)The weighted-average exercise price of such shares is uncertain and is not included in this column. (7)None of these equity compensation plans contains a limit on the number of shares that may be issued under such plans; however, these plans are subject to the limitations set forth in the descriptions of these plans contained in footnote 5 above.

315293,AON,Aon plc,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTSDuring 2016, we continued to face headwinds that adversely impacted our business. In our Risk Solutions segment, these headwinds included adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, economic weakness in certain regions around the globe and a negative market impact in our Reinsurance business. In our HR Solutions segment, these headwinds included price compression in our benefits administration business and economic weakness in certain regions around the globe.The following is a summary of our 2016 financial results:•Revenue decreased $55 million to $11.6 billion in 2016 due primarily to a 2% unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a 2% decrease in commissions and fees related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by organic revenue growth of 3% in the Risk Solutions segment and 3% in the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth for the year was driven by strong new business generation and solid management of the renewal book portfolio across our Risk Solutions segment, as well as solid growth in both our Consulting and Outsourcing businesses within HR Solutions.•Operating expenses decreased $113 million, or 1%, to $9.7 billion in 2016 due primarily to a $248 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, a $176 million decrease in expenses related to legacy litigation incurred in the prior year, a $144 million decrease in the core expense base resulting from acquisitions, net of divestitures, and a $37 million decrease in intangible asset amortization, partially offset by $220 million of non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements, an increase in expense associated with 3% organic revenue growth, and $15 million of transaction costs incurred related to future portfolio repositioning activities.•Operating margin increased to 16.4% in 2016 from 15.8% in 2015. The increase in operating margin from the prior year is primarily driven by organic revenue growth of 3% and return on investments across the portfolio as well as a decrease in expense related to legacy litigation and the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements. Risk Solutions operating margin increased to 21.2% in 2016 from 20.3% in 2015. HR Solutions operating margin increased to 13.3% in 2016 from 12.5% in 2015.•Net income attributable to Aon shareholders was $1.4 billion, an increase of $11 million, or 1%, from 2015. Diluted earnings per share increased 6% to $5.16 in 2016 from $4.88 in 2015.•Cash flow provided by operating activities was $2.3 billion in 2016, an increase of $317 million, or 16%, from $2.0 billion in 2015, due primarily to an increase in underlying net income after adjusting for certain non-cash pension expenses, lower cash pension contributions, and lower cash tax payments. •On February 9, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell our Benefits Administration and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Portfolio (the “Business”) for cash consideration of $4.3 billion payable at closing plus additional cash consideration of up to $500 million based on future performance of the Business (the “Transaction”). The Business is within the HR Solutions segment described further below. The completion of the Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, and the Transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2017. In connection with the Transaction, we expect to implement a cost reduction program that will result in a future charge to the financial statements. We believe the cost reduction program will reduce stranded costs, create greater efficiency, and contribute towards the Company's objective of being accretive to analysts’ consensus earnings of $7.97 per share in 2018, as published by FactSet. Refer to Note 18 “Subsequent Event - Disposition of Benefits Administration and Business Process Outsourcing” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Transaction.We focus on four key non-GAAP metrics that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margins, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for 2016:•Organic revenue growth, a non-GAAP metric as defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 3% in 2016. Organic revenue growth was driven by growth across every major business in both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was driven by strong growth in Retail brokerage across both the Americas and International businesses, as well as modest growth in Reinsurance. In HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in health care exchanges and in HR BPO for cloud-based solutions as well as growth in investment and communications consulting.28•Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP metric as defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 20.8% for Aon overall, 24.5% for the Risk Solutions segment, and 18.4% for the HR Solutions segment in 2016. In 2015, adjusted operating margin was 20.0% for Aon overall, 23.6% for the Risk Solutions segment, and 18.1% for the HR Solutions segment. The increase in adjusted operating margin for the Risk Solutions segment primarily reflects solid organic revenue growth and return on investments in data and analytics. The increase in adjusted operating margin for the HR Solutions segment primarily reflects solid organic revenue growth and expense discipline, partially offset by lost operating income and stranded costs related to previous dispositions, as well as unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.•Adjusted diluted earnings per share from net income attributable to Aon’s shareholders, a non-GAAP metric as defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $6.59 per share in 2016, an increase of $0.41 per share, or 7%, from $6.18 per share in 2015. The increase demonstrates solid operational performance and effective capital management, highlighted by $1.3 billion of share repurchase during 2016.•Free cash flow, a non-GAAP metric as defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $2.1 billion in 2016, an increase of $385 million, or 22%, from $1.7 billion in 2015. The increase in free cash flow from the prior year was driven by record cash flow from operations of $2.3 billion and a 23%, or $68 million, decrease in capital expenditures.REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAs described in Note 1 “Basis of Presentation - Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we identified errors that impacted the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The corrections for the errors, which we have concluded are immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, to all prior-period consolidated financial statements, are reflected herein.Summary of ResultsOur consolidated results of operations follow (in millions):Years ended December 312016 2015 2014Revenue: Commissions, fees and other$11,605 $11,661 $12,019Fiduciary investment income22 21 26Total revenue11,627 11,682 12,045Expenses: Compensation and benefits6,914 6,837 7,014Other general expenses2,807 2,997 3,065Total operating expenses9,721 9,834 10,079Operating income1,906 1,848 1,966Interest income9 14 10Interest expense(282) (273) (255)Other income36 100 44Income before income taxes1,669 1,689 1,765Income taxes239 267 334Net income1,430 1,422 1,431Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests34 37 34Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,396 $1,385 $1,397Consolidated Results for 2016 Compared to 2015 RevenueRevenue decreased by $55 million, to $11.6 billion in 2016, compared to $11.7 billion in 2015. The decrease was driven by a 2% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a 2% decrease in commissions and fees related to acquisitions, net of 29divestitures, partially offset by organic revenue growth of 3% in the Risk Solutions segment and 3% in the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth in the Risk Solutions segment was driven by solid growth across both the Americas and International businesses. Record new business generation in US Retail, as well as strength in Affinity and growth across Latin America drove organic revenue growth in the Americas. International organic revenue growth was driven by growth across every major region; including Asia, EMEA, and the Pacific, despite economic weakness in certain countries. Reinsurance organic revenue growth was driven by net new business growth in treaty placements globally and modest growth in facultative placements, partially offset by an unfavorable market impact in treaty and a decline in capital markets transactions and advisory business. Organic revenue growth in the HR Solutions segment was driven by solid growth in both Consulting and Outsourcing. Consulting organic revenue growth was driven by retirement solutions, including investment consulting and delegated investment solutions, and communications consulting. Strong growth in health care exchanges and new client wins in HR BPO for cloud-based solutions drove organic revenue growth in Outsourcing.Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits increased $77 million, or 1%, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by a $220 million increase in non-cash expense related to certain pension settlements and an increase in expense associated with 3% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $169 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a $97 million decrease in the core expense base resulting from acquisitions, net of divestitures.Other General ExpensesOther general expenses decreased $190 million, or 6%, compared to 2015 due primarily to a $176 million decrease in expense related to legacy litigation incurred in the prior year, a $79 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, a $47 million decrease in the core expense base resulting from acquisitions, net of divestitures, and a $37 million decrease in intangible amortization, partially offset by an increase in expense to support 3% organic revenue growth and $15 million of transaction costs incurred related to portfolio repositioning activities including the Transaction. Interest IncomeInterest income represents income earned on Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income decreased $5 million, or 36%, from 2015, due to marginally lower average interest rates globally.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $9 million, or 3%, from 2015. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects an increase in total debt outstanding.Other Income Other income decreased $64 million from $100 million in 2015 to $36 million in 2016. Other income in 2016 includes, among other things, $39 million in net gains on disposition of businesses and $13 million of equity earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $2 million and a $14 million net loss on certain financial instruments. Other income in 2015 includes $82 million in net gains on disposition of businesses, foreign exchange gains of $30 million, equity earnings of $13 million, partially offset by a $5 million net loss on certain long term investments and a $19 million loss from derivatives.Income before Income TaxesIncome before income taxes was $1.7 billion in 2016, a decrease of $20 million, or 1%, from $1.7 billion in 2015 due to drivers identified above. Income TaxesThe effective tax rate on net income was 14.3% in 2016 and 15.8% in 2015. The 2016 and 2015 rates reflect changes in the geographical distribution of income, the impact from certain pension settlements in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, a reduction in U.S. income resulting from the settlement of legacy litigation in the second quarter of 2015, and the impact of certain discrete items.Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income increased to $1.40 billion ($5.16 diluted net income per share) in 2016, compared to $1.39 billion ($4.88 diluted net income per share) in 2015.30Consolidated Results for 2015 Compared to 2014 RevenueRevenue decreased by $363 million, or 3%, to $11.7 billion in 2015, compared to $12.0 billion in 2014. The decrease was driven by a 6% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by organic revenue growth of 3% in the Risk Solutions segment and 4% in the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth in the Risk Solutions segment was driven by solid growth across both the Americas and International businesses. Growth across all regions and product lines, including strong new business generation in US Retail, drove organic revenue growth in the Americas. International organic revenue growth in 2015 was driven by solid growth across Asia, the Pacific, and emerging markets, and strong management of the renewal book portfolio in continental Europe despite economic weakness. Reinsurance was down modestly due to an unfavorable market impact in treaty and a decline in capital markets transactions and advisory business, which more than offset the new business growth in treaty placements globally and modest growth in facultative placements. Organic revenue growth in the HR Solutions segment was driven by solid growth in both Consulting and Outsourcing. Consulting organic revenue growth was driven by retirement solutions, including investment consulting and delegated investment solutions, and compensation consulting. Strong growth in health care exchanges, new client wins in HR BPO for cloud-based solutions, and project-related revenue in benefits administration drove organic revenue growth in Outsourcing.Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits decreased $177 million in 2015, or 3%, compared to 2014. The decrease was driven by a $432 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by $14 million increase in expenses resulting from acquisitions, net of divestitures and an increase in expense associated with 3% organic revenue growth.Other General ExpensesOther general expenses decreased $68 million in 2015, or 2%, compared to 2014 due largely to a $166 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a $38 million decrease in intangible amortization, partially offset by a $102 million increase in expense related to legacy litigation, and an increase in expense to support 3% organic revenue growth.Interest IncomeInterest income represents income earned on Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income increased $4 million in 2015, or 40%, from 2014, due to marginally higher average interest rates globally.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $18 million in 2015, or 7%, from 2014. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects an increase in total debt outstanding.Other Income Other income increased $56 million from $44 million in 2014 to $100 million in 2015. Other income in 2015 includes, among other things, $82 million in net gains on disposition of businesses, foreign exchange gains of $30 million, and equity earnings of $13 million, partially offset by a $5 million net loss on certain financial instruments and a $19 million loss from derivatives. Other income in 2014 includes $24 million in gains on disposition of businesses, foreign exchange gains of $18 million, equity earnings of $12 million, and $4 million in gains on investments, partially offset by a $19 million loss from derivatives.Income before Income TaxesIncome before income taxes was $1.7 billion in 2015, a decrease of $76 million, or 4%, from $1.8 billion in 2014 due to drivers identified above.Income TaxesThe effective tax rate on net income was 15.8% in 2015 and 18.9% in 2014. The 2015 and 2014 tax rates reflect changes in the geographical distribution of income, a reduction in U.S. income resulting from the settlement of a legacy litigation matter in the second quarter of 2015, and the impact of certain discrete items. Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income decreased to $1.39 billion ($4.88 diluted net income per share) in 2015, compared to $1.4 billion ($4.66 diluted net income per share) in 2014.31 Non-GAAP MetricsIn our discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.Organic Revenue GrowthWe use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of intersegment and intrasegment activity and excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, fiduciary investment income, reimbursable expenses, and certain unusual items. Supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. Reconciliations of this non-GAAP measure, organic revenue growth percentages, to the reported Commissions, fees and other revenue growth percentages, have been provided under the “Review by Segment” caption below.Adjusted Operating MarginWe use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of our Risk Solutions and HR Solutions segments. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, including intangible asset amortization and certain pension settlements, transaction costs, and litigation settlements, because we do not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported operating margins is as follows (in millions, except percentage data):Year Ended December 31, 2016TotalAon (1) RiskSolutions HRSolutionsRevenue — U.S. GAAP$11,627 $7,485 $4,183Operating income — U.S. GAAP$1,906 $1,587 $557Intangible asset amortization277 105 172Pension settlements220 144 26Transaction costs$15 $— $15Operating income — as adjusted$2,418 $1,836 $770Operating margins — U.S. GAAP16.4% 21.2% 13.3%Operating margins — as adjusted20.8% 24.5% 18.4%Year Ended December 31, 2015TotalAon (1) RiskSolutions HRSolutionsRevenue — U.S. GAAP$11,682 $7,426 $4,303Operating income — U.S. GAAP$1,848 $1,506 $536Intangible asset amortization314 109 205Legacy litigation176 137 39Operating income — as adjusted$2,338 $1,752 $780Operating margins — U.S. GAAP15.8% 20.3% 12.5%Operating margins — as adjusted20.0% 23.6% 18.1%32Year Ended December 31, 2014TotalAon (1) RiskSolutions HRSolutionsRevenue — U.S. GAAP$12,045 $7,834 $4,264Operating income — U.S. GAAP$1,966 $1,648 $485Intangible asset amortization352 109 243Legacy litigation35 35 —Operating income — as adjusted$2,353 $1,792 $728Operating margins — U.S. GAAP16.3% 21.0% 11.4%Operating margins — as adjusted19.5% 22.9% 17.1%(1)Includes unallocated expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenue.Adjusted Diluted Earnings per ShareWe also use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization and certain pension settlements, transaction costs, and litigation settlements, along with related income taxes because we do not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.The effective tax rates used in the U.S. GAAP financial statements were 14.3% and 15.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluded items are generally taxed at the effective tax rate. However, after adjusting the underlying annual tax rate to exclude the impact associated with certain non-cash pension settlements in the second and fourth quarters of 2016 and expenses for legacy litigation in the second quarter of 2015, the adjusted effective tax rates for the full years 2016 and 2015 were 16.8% and 17.9%, respectively.33Reconciliations of this non-GAAP measure to the reported diluted earnings per share are as follows (in millions, except per share data):Year Ended December 31, 2016U.S. GAAP Adjustments As AdjustedOperating income$1,906 $512 $2,418Interest income9 — 9Interest expense(282) — (282)Other income36 — 36Income before income taxes1,669 512 2,181Income taxes239 128 367Net income1,430 384 1,814Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests34 — 34Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,396 $384 $1,780Diluted earnings per share $5.16 $1.43 $6.59Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted270.3 270.3Year Ended December 31, 2015U.S. GAAP Adjustments As AdjustedOperating income$1,848 $490 $2,338Interest income14 — 14Interest expense(273) — (273)Other income100 — 100Income before income taxes1,689 490 2,179Income taxes267 122 389Net income1,422 368 1,790Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests37 — 37Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,385 $368 $1,753Diluted earnings per share$4.88 $1.30 $6.18Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted283.8 283.8Year Ended December 31, 2014U.S. GAAP Adjustments As AdjustedOperating income$1,966 $387 $2,353Interest income10 — 10Interest expense(255) — (255)Other income44 — 44Income before income taxes1,765 387 2,152Income taxes334 73 407Net income1,431 314 1,745Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests34 — 34Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,397 $314 $1,711Diluted earnings per share$4.66 $1.05 $5.71Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted299.6 299.6Free Cash FlowWe use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures.34A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions):Years Ended December 312016 2015 2014Cash flow provided by operating activities - U.S. GAAP$2,326 $2,009 $1,812Less: Capital expenditures(222) (290) (256)Free cash flow$2,104 $1,719 $1,556Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate FluctuationsWe conduct business in more than 120 countries, and, because of this, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the last year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates. Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of $0.01 on diluted earnings per share during the year ended December 31, 2016; currency fluctuations had unfavorable impacts of $0.38 and $0.11 on diluted earnings per share in the years ended 2015 and 2014, respectively, when prior year results were translated at rates prevalent in those years. Currency fluctuations had unfavorable impacts of $0.01, $0.41, and $0.11 on diluted earnings per share in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, when prior year results were translated at rates prevalent in those years. These translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityExecutive SummaryWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations, available cash reserves, committed credit facilities, and debt capacity available through public debt markets, both short and long-term. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension contributions, and shareholder dividends. We believe that cash flows from operations and available debt financing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future.Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds generally cannot be used for general corporate purposes and are not a source of liquidity.Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments decreased $19 million to $721 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. During 2016, cash flow from operating activities increased $317 million to $2.3 billion. Additional sources of funds in 2016 included proceeds from the sale of businesses of $107 million and issuances of debt, net of repayments of $522 million. The primary uses of funds in 2016 included share repurchases of $1.3 billion, acquisitions of businesses of $879 million, dividends to shareholders of $345 million, and capital expenditures of $222 million.To manage unforeseen situations, we have committed credit lines of approximately $1.3 billion and we endeavor to manage our obligations to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings. At December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings on these credit lines.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities during 2016 increased $317 million in 2015, or 16%, to $2.3 billion. This amount represents net income reported by the Company, as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses, financial instruments and foreign exchange, and our non-cash expenses, which include share-based compensation, depreciation, and amortization, as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and collection of receivables. The increase from the prior year was primarily driven by net income, as adjusted for non-cash charges, and reductions in pension contributions.35Pension contributions were $123 million during 2016 compared to $194 million during 2015. In 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $185 million to our pension plans, with the majority attributable to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates.We expect cash generated by operations for 2016 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, purchases shares under our share repurchase program, and pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. We have committed credit facilities of approximately $1.3 billion, all of which was available at December 31, 2016, and can access these facilities on a same day or next day basis. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.Investing ActivitiesCash used for investing activities in 2016 was $954 million. The primary drivers of the cash used for investing activities were $879 million for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, $222 million for capital expenditures, and $21 million of net purchases of long-term investments, partially offset by $107 million of sale of businesses and $61 million of net sales of short-term investments. Cash used for investing activities in 2015 was $138 million. The primary drivers of the cash flow used for investing activities were $290 million for capital expenditures, $46 million of net purchases of long-term investments, and $16 million for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, partially offset by sales of businesses of $205 million and net sales of short-term investments of $9 million. Cash used for investing activities in 2014 was $545 million. The primary drivers of the cash used for investing activities were $479 million for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, and $256 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by net sales of long-term investments, sale of businesses of $48 million, and net sales of short-term investments of $32 million. Financing ActivitiesCash used for financing activities during 2016 was $1.3 billion. The primary drivers of the cash used for financing activities were share repurchases of $1.3 billion, dividends paid to shareholders of $345 million, and net cash payments of $129 million related to issuance of shares, partially offset by issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $522 million.Cash used for financing activities during 2015 was $1.7 billion. The primary drivers of the cash flow used for financing activities were share repurchases of $1.6 billion, dividends paid to shareholders of $323 million, and net cash payments of $30 million related to issuance of shares, partially offset by issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $253 million.Cash used for financing activities during 2014 was $1.3 billion. The primary drivers of the cash flow used for financing activities were share repurchases of $2.3 billion, dividends paid to shareholders of $273 million, and issuance of shares for employee benefit plans of $105 million, partially offset by issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $1.3 billion.Cash and Short-Term InvestmentsAt December 31, 2016, our Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments were $721 million, a decrease of $19 million from December 31, 2015, primarily related to share repurchases of $1.3 billion, payments for the acquisition of businesses of $879 million, cash dividends of $345 million, capital expenditures of $222 million, and cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans of $123 million, partially offset by $2.3 billion in Cash flow from operating activities, the net issuances of debt of $522 million, and proceeds for the sale of businesses of $107 million. Of the total balance as of December 31, 2016, $82 million was restricted as to its use, which was comprised of $53 million of operating funds in the U.K., as required by the FCA, and $29 million held as collateral for various business purposes. At December 31, 2016, $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and overdrawn cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.2 billion were held in other countries. Due to differences in tax rates, the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S. could have an unfavorable tax impact. We maintain multi-currency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall balance does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities were negative; however, the overall balance was positive.At December 31, 2015, our Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments were $740 million, a decrease of $28 million from December 31, 2014, primarily related to share repurchases of $1.6 billion and dividends to shareholders of $323 million, partially offset by $2.0 billion in Cash flow from operating activities and the net issuances of debt of $253 million. Of the total balance as of December 31, 2015, $105 million was restricted as to its use, which was comprised of $65 million of operating funds in the U.K., as required by the FCA, and $40 million held as collateral for various business purposes. At 36December 31, 2015, $2.6 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments were held in the U.S. and overdrawn Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments of $1.9 billion were held in other countries. Due to differences in tax rates, the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S. could have an unfavorable tax impact.In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. In addition, some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and from the impact of foreign currency movements. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly-rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the amount we report for Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities are equal. Our Fiduciary assets included cash and short-term investments of $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and fiduciary receivables of $5.7 billion and $6.5 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes.As disclosed in Note 13 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.As of December 31, 2016, our investments in money market funds had a fair value of $1.4 billion and are reported as Short-term investments or Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position depending on their nature and initial maturity.The following table summarizes our Fiduciary assets and non-fiduciary Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments as of December 31, 2016 (in millions): Statement of Financial Position Classification Asset TypeCash and CashEquivalents Short-termInvestments FiduciaryAssets TotalCertificates of deposit, bank deposits or time deposits$431 $— $2,735 $3,166Money market funds— 290 1,081 1,371Other investments due within one year— — — —Cash and investments431 290 3,816 4,537Fiduciary receivables— — 5,669 5,669Total$431 $290 $9,485 $10,206Share Repurchase ProgramIn April 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “2012 Share Repurchase Program”) under which up to $5.0 billion of Class A Ordinary Shares may be repurchased. In November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (“the 2014 Share Repurchase Program” and together with the 2012 Share Repurchase Program, the “Share Repurchase Programs”) pursuant to which an additional $5.0 billion may be repurchased, in addition to the $5.0 billion of Class A Ordinary Shares authorized under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program. In February 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the then existing remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Under each Share Repurchase Program, shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, based on prevailing market conditions, funded from available capital.During 2016, the Company repurchased 12.2 million shares at an average price per share of $102.66, for a total cost of $1.3 billion. The Company recorded an additional $6 million of costs associated with the repurchase to retained earnings during 2016. During 2015, the Company repurchased 16.0 million shares at an average price per share of $97.04 for a total cost of $1.6 billion. In August 2015, the $5.0 billion of Class A Ordinary Shares authorized under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program was exhausted. At December 31, 2016, and without giving effect to the increase in February 2017, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program was $2.8 billion. Under the Repurchase Programs, the Company has repurchased a total of 90.2 million shares for an aggregate cost of $7.2 billion through December 31, 2016. 37For information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2016, see Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,” as previously described.DividendsDuring 2016, 2015, and 2014, we paid dividends on our Class A Ordinary Shares of $345 million, $323 million, and $273 million, respectively. Dividends paid per Class A Ordinary Share were $1.29, $1.15, and $0.92 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.Distributable ReservesAs a U.K. incorporated company, we are required under U.K. law to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company. Distributable reserves are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had distributable reserves in excess of $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. We believe that we will have sufficient distributable reserves to fund share repurchases and shareholder dividends for the foreseeable future.BorrowingsTotal debt at December 31, 2016 was $6.2 billion, which represents an increase of $505 million compared to December 31, 2015. This increase is primarily due to issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $522 million, including a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of $279 million compared to December 31, 2015. On May 27, 2016, $500 million of 3.125% Senior Notes due May 2016 issued by Aon Corporation matured and were repaid in full.On March 1, 2016, Aon plc issued $750 million of 3.875% Senior Notes due December 2025. The Company used the proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes.Credit FacilitiesAs of December 31, 2016, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding: our $400 million U.S. credit facility expiring in March 2017 (the “2017 Facility”) and our $900 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility originally expiring in February 2020. Effective February 2, 2016, the $900 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility terms were extended for one year and will now expire on February 2, 2021 (the “2021 Facility”). Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly. We intend to let the 2017 facility expire, but may obtain additional committed credit facilities in the future. At December 31, 2016, we did not have borrowings under either the 2017 Facility or the 2021 Facility, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio at December 31, 2016 and 2015, is calculated as follows (in millions, except ratio):Years Ended December 312016 2015Net income$1,430 $1,422Interest expense282 273Income taxes239 267Depreciation of fixed assets232 229Amortization of intangible assets277 314Total EBITDA$2,460 $2,505Total Debt$6,205 $5,700Total debt-to-EBITDA ratio2.5 2.3We use EBITDA, as defined by our financial covenants, as a non-GAAP measure. This supplemental information related to EBITDA represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.38Shelf Registration StatementOn September 3, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of debt securities, preference shares, Class A Ordinary Shares, and convertible securities, among other securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions and other factors.Rating Agency RatingsThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at February 23, 2017 appear in the table below. Ratings SeniorLong-term Debt Commercial Paper OutlookStandard & Poor’sA- A-2 StableMoody’s Investor ServicesBaa2 P-2 StableFitch, Inc.BBB+ F-2 StableA downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to debt capital, reduce our financial flexibility, increase our commercial paper interest rates, or restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether, and/or impact future pension contribution requirements.Letters of Credit and Other GuaranteesWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit (“LOCs”). We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $90 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $58 million at December 31, 2015. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.We have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $95 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $104 million at December 31, 2015.Other Liquidity MattersWe do not have exposure related to off balance sheet arrangements. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability, and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See Item 1, “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Contractual ObligationsSummarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in millions): Payments due in 2017 2018 –2019 2020 –2021 2022 andbeyond TotalPrincipal payments on debt$336 $278 $1,000 $4,700 $6,314Interest payments on debt271 522 479 2,570 3,842Operating leases355 600 451 696 2,102Pension and other postretirement benefit plans189 485 396 1,023 2,093Purchase obligations410 405 133 12 960Total$1,561 $2,290 $2,459 $9,001 $15,311Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to ERISA and other regulations and minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions.39In 2013, our principal U.K subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the U.K. plans to contribute an average of $11 million per year to that pension plan for the next three years. We are currently negotiating the 2016 valuation, which will determine the required cash contributions for the next three years. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated winding-up deficit was £175 million ($215 million at December 31, 2016 exchange rates). The trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the winding-up deficit be paid.Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts. Purchase obligations exclude $278 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when potential cash settlements will be made.Financial ConditionAt December 31, 2016, our net assets were $5.5 billion, representing total assets minus total liabilities, a decrease from $6.1 billion as revised for December 31, 2015 (see Note 1 “Basis of Presentation - Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the revision of previously issued financial statements). The decrease was due primarily to share repurchases of $1.3 billion, dividends to shareholders of $345 million, and an increase in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $489 million related primarily to foreign currency translation, partially offset by Net income of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Working capital increased by $171 million from $480 million at December 31, 2015 to $651 million at December 31, 2016.Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $489 million at December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015, which was primarily driven by negative net foreign currency translation adjustments of $493 million, which are attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, a decrease of $16 million in net post-retirement benefit obligations, and net financial instrument losses of $12 million.REVIEW BY SEGMENTOverviewWe serve clients through the following segments:•Risk Solutions acts as an advisor and insurance and reinsurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, via consultation, as well as negotiation and placement of insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.•HR Solutions partners with organizations to solve their most complex benefits, talent and related financial challenges, and improve business performance by designing, implementing, communicating and administering a wide range of human capital, retirement, investment management, health care, compensation and talent management strategies.Risk SolutionsYears ended December 31 (millions, except percentage data)2016 2015 2014Revenue$7,485 $7,426 $7,834Operating income$1,587 $1,506 $1,648Operating margin21.2% 20.3% 21.0%The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units, and is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue, and asset values. During 2016, pricing was modestly negative on average globally, and we still consider this a “soft market.” In a soft market, premium rates flatten or decrease, along with commission revenues, due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity. Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds. Continuing through 2016, we faced difficult conditions as a result of continued weakness in the global economy, and the repricing of credit risk. Weak economic conditions in many markets around the globe have reduced our customers’ demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products, which have had a negative impact on our operational results.40Risk Solutions generated approximately 64% of our consolidated total revenues in 2016. Revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients, commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients’ policy renewals, the net effect of new and lost business, the timing of services provided to our clients, and the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates.We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, health care providers, and non-profit groups, among others; provide affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses; provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance; provide capital management transaction and advisory products and services, including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services, capital raising, contingent capital financing, insurance-linked securitizations and derivative applications; provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; provide risk consulting, actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and manage captive insurance companies.RevenueCommissions, fees and other revenue for Risk Solutions were as follows (in millions):Years ended December 312016 2015 2014Retail brokerage: Americas$3,357 $3,294 $3,288International (1)2,739 2,750 3,046Total retail brokerage6,096 6,044 6,334Reinsurance brokerage1,367 1,361 1,474Total$7,463 $7,405 $7,808(1)Includes the U.K., Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.In 2016, Commissions, fees and other revenue increased $58 million, or 1%, compared to 2015 due to 3% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.

Organic revenue growth for 2016 was driven by net new business growth in treaty placements globally and modest growth in facultative placements, partially offset by an unfavorable market impact in treaty and a decline in capital markets transactions and advisory business.Operating IncomeOperating income increased $81 million, or 5%, from 2015 to $1.6 billion in 2016. In 2016, operating income margins in this segment were 21.2%, an increase of 90 basis points from 20.3% in 2015. The increase in operating margin was driven by solid organic revenue growth and returns on investments in data and analytics across the portfolio, as well as a decrease in expense related to certain legacy litigation in the prior year.HR SolutionsYears ended December 31 (millions, except percentage data)2016 2015 2014Revenue$4,183 $4,303 $4,264Operating income$557 $536 $485Operating margin13.3% 12.5% 11.4%Our HR Solutions segment generated approximately 36% of our consolidated total revenues in 2016 and provides a broad range of human capital services, as follows:•Retirement specializes in global actuarial services, defined contribution consulting, tax and ERISA consulting, and pension administration.•Compensation focuses on compensatory advisory/counsel including: compensation planning design, executive reward strategies, salary survey and benchmarking, market share studies, and sales force effectiveness, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries.•Strategic Human Capital delivers advice to complex global organizations on talent, change, and organizational effectiveness issues, including talent strategy and acquisition, executive on-boarding, performance management, leadership assessment and development, communication strategy, workforce training, and change management.•Investment consulting advises public and private companies, other institutions, and trustees on developing and maintaining investment programs across a broad range of plan types, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, endowments, and foundations.•Benefits Administration applies our human resource expertise primarily through defined benefit (pension), defined contribution (401(k)), and health and welfare administrative services.

Operating margin improvement was driven by solid organic revenue growth and expense discipline, partially offset by lost operating income and stranded costs related to previous dispositions, as well as unfavorable foreign currency translation.Unallocated Income and ExpenseA reconciliation of our operating income to income before income taxes is as follows (in millions):Years ended December 312016 2015 2014Operating income (loss): Risk Solutions$1,587 $1,506 $1,648HR Solutions557 536 485Unallocated expense(238) (194) (167)Operating income1,906 1,848 1,966Interest income9 14 10Interest expense(282) (273) (255)Other income36 100 44Income before income taxes$1,669 $1,689 $1,765Unallocated operating expense includes corporate governance costs not allocated to the operating segments. Net unallocated expenses increased $44 million to $238 million in 2016 compared to $194 million in 2015 due primarily to $50 million of non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements.43Interest income, Interest expense, and Other income and its components are discussed in Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Review of Consolidated Results.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESOur Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.Revenue RecognitionRisk Solutions segment revenues primarily include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. Revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable. We consider revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when all of the following four conditions are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable, (3) delivery or performance has occurred, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. For brokerage commissions, revenue is typically recognized at the completion of the placement process, assuming all four criteria required to recognize revenue have been met. The placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy. Commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data.HR Solutions segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice and outsourcing contracts. Fees paid by clients for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project, or fixed-fee basis. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed, assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met. Revenues from fixed-fee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportional-performance model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement. Revenues from healthcare exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants, net of a reserve for estimated cancellations, assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues. Our outsourcing contracts typically have three-to-five year terms for benefits services and five-to-ten year terms for human resources business process outsourcing (“HR BPO”) services. We recognize revenues as services are performed, assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met. We may also receive implementation fees from clients either up-front or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant. Lump sum implementation fees received from a client are typically deferred and recognized ratably over the ongoing contract services period. If a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract, a loss on the contract may be recorded, if necessary, and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would typically be recognized over the remaining service period through the termination date.In connection with our long-term outsourcing service agreements, highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on our systems and operating processes. For outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting, specific, incremental, and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized. Deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue.PensionsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada and are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands and Canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted. Beginning for 2016 expense, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost for our major pension and other post-retirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. In 2015 and prior years, we estimated these components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost by 44applying a single weighted-average discount rate, derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.Recognition of gains and losses and prior service Certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost.Unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into Compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., the Netherlands, Canada, and U.K. plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.As of December 31, 2016, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.The following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2017 amortization of loss by country (millions, except amortization period): U.K. U.S. OtherUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses$1,256 $1,618 $394Amortization period9 - 31 7 - 26 14 - 40Estimated 2017 amortization of loss$30 $52 $11The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2016 was $6 million, $19 million, and $(6) million in the U.S., U.K. and other plans, respectively.For the U.S. pension plans we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2016, the market-related value of assets was $1.8 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of plan assets was $1.7 billion.Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocationThe following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix as of December 31, 2016: U.K. U.S. OtherExpected return3.36% 7.88% 2.68 - 5.15%In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we survey multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and non-U.S. category, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Further, target allocations are subject to change.45Impact of changing economic assumptionsChanges in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2016 (in millions):Estimated liability discount rateIncrease (decrease) in projected benefit obligation of December 31, 2016 (1)25 Basis Point Change in Discount RateIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(226) $237U.S. plans(83) 87Other plans(53) 56(1)Increases to the projected benefit obligation reflect increases to our pension obligations, while decreases in the projected benefit obligation are recoveries toward fully funded status.

We classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames, customer related and contract based, or technology and other.Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we also test the acquired tradenames (which also are not amortized) for impairment. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. No events occurred during 2016 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames.46We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.The goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, including goodwill, of the corresponding reporting unit. If the “more likely than not” threshold is not met, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two-step analysis. Step One requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in Step One and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value.In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. Based on tests performed in both 2016 and 2015, there was no indication of goodwill impairment, and no further testing was required.We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2016. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.ContingenciesWe define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection.Share-Based PaymentsShare-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Restricted Share UnitsRestricted share units (“RSUs”) are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.47Performance Share AwardsPerformance share awards (“PSAs”) are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.Compensation cost is recognized over the performance period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.The largest performance-based share-based payment award plan is the Leadership Performance Plan (“LPP”), which has a three-year performance period. The 2014 to 2016 performance period ended on December 31, 2016, the 2013 to 2015 performance period ended on December 31, 2015 and the 2012 to 2014 performance period ended on December 31, 2014. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2015 to 2017 and 2016 to 2018. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2016 expense by approximately $8.1 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $8.1 million. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense.Income TaxesWe earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies, and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In this assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination. We have not recognized a deferred tax liability for permanently reinvested earnings of certain subsidiaries. Additional income taxes could be recorded (or incurred) if we change our investment strategy relating to these subsidiaries, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.We base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if determinable.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.Foreign Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign exchange rate risk. Our primary exposures include exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, and the Indian rupee. We use over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements.48Additionally, some of our non-U.S. brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in U.S. dollars and euros, but most of their expenses are incurred in British pounds. At December 31, 2016, we have hedged approximately 45% of our U.K. subsidiaries’ expected exposures to both U.S. dollar and Euro transactions for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years.We also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures, such as inter-company notes and short-term assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency and are subject to remeasurement.The potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would be $32 million and $18 million at December 31, 2017 and 2018 respectively.Interest Rate RiskOur fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates, and as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the North America, continental Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $41 million to both 2017 and 2018 pretax income, respectively. A corresponding increase in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase, net of derivative positions, of $41 million to both 2017 and 2018 pretax income, respectively.We have long-term debt outstanding with a fair market value of $6.3 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This fair value was greater than the carrying value by $0.4 billion at December 31, 2016, and $0.2 billion greater than the carrying value at December 31, 2015. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 8% or an increase of 9%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events.49",2023-12-30 20:32:49.054500
315293,AON,Aon plc,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTSAon plc is a leading global professional services firm that provides advice and solutions to clients focused on risk, retirement, and health, delivering distinctive client value via innovative and effective risk management and workforce productivity solutions. Management is leading a set of initiatives designed to strengthen Aon and unite the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by proprietary data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency. The divestiture of the benefits administration and business process outsourcing in the second quarter of 2017 represents the next step of our strategy, reinforces our focus to provide advice and solutions, and further aligns our portfolio around our clients’ highest priorities. Further, it reinforces our ROIC decision-making process and emphasis on operating cash flow. Discontinued OperationsOn February 9, 2017, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Tempo Acquisition, LLC to sell the Divested Business to the Buyer, an entity formed and controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P., and certain designated purchasers that are direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Buyer. On May 1, 2017, the Buyer purchased all of the outstanding equity interests in each of the Divested Business’ subsidiaries, plus certain related assets and liabilities, for a purchase price of $4.3 billion in cash paid at closing, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and deferred consideration of up to $500 million. Cash proceeds after customary adjustments and before taxes due were $4.2 billion.Aon and the Buyer entered into certain transaction related agreements at the closing, including two commercial agreements, a transition services agreement, certain intellectual property license agreements, sub-leases and other customary agreements. Aon expects to continue to be a significant client of the Divested Business and the Divested Business has agreed to use Aon for its broking and other services for a specified period of time. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a gain on sale, net of taxes, of $779 million and a non-cash impairment charge to its tradenames associated with the Divested Business of $380 million as these assets were not sold to the Buyer. Additionally, effective May 1, 2017, consistent with operating as one segment, the Company has implemented a three-year strategy to transition to a unified Aon brand. As a result, Aon commenced amortization of all indefinite lived tradenames and prospectively accelerated amortization of its finite lived tradenames over the three-year period. The accelerated amortization and impairment charge are included in Amortization and impairment of intangible assets on the Consolidated Statement of Income.Financial Results The following is a summary of our 2017 financial results from continuing operations:•Revenue increased 6%, or $589 million, to $10.0 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting 4% organic revenue growth and a 2% increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Organic revenue growth for the year was driven by growth across every major revenue line, with particular strength in Reinsurance Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services•Operating expenses increased $1.2 billion, or 16%, to $9.0 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to $497 million of restructuring costs, a $380 million non-cash impairment charge to the indefinite lived tradenames associated with the sale of the Divested Business, a $258 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, $143 million of accelerated amortization related to tradenames, and an increase in expense associated with 4% organic revenue growth, partially offset by $165 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives and a $92 million decrease in expenses related to certain pension settlements.•Operating margin decreased to 9.8% in 2017 from 17.4% in 2016. The decrease in operating margin from the prior year is primarily driven by an increase in operating expenses, described above, partially offset by organic revenue growth of 4% and core operational improvement.•Due to the factors set forth above, income from continuing operations was $435 million in 2017, a decrease of $818 million, or 65%, from 2016. •Cash flow provided by operating activities was $669 million in 2017, a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 63%, from $1.8 billion in 2016, due primarily to cash tax payments of approximately $940 million associated with the Divested Business, $280 million of cash payments for restructuring charges, and $45 million of transaction costs related to the Divested Business, partially offset by operational improvement.27We focus on four key non-GAAP metrics that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margins, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics from continuing operations for 2017:•Organic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 4% in 2017, comparable to 4% organic growth in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was driven by growth across every major revenue line, with particular strength in Reinsurance Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services.•Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 23.4% in 2017, compared to 21.6% in the prior year. The increase in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects organic revenue growth of 4%, core operational improvement, and $165 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.•Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $6.52 per share in 2017, an increase of $0.94 per share, or 17%, from $5.58 per share in 2016. The increase demonstrates solid operational performance and effective capital management, highlighted by a record $2.4 billion of share repurchase during 2017, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and losses recognized in other expense.•Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $486 million in 2017, a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 71%, from $1.7 billion in 2016. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior year was driven by a decrease in cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion and a 17%, or $27 million, increase in capital expenditures.28REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTSSummary of ResultsOur consolidated results are as follow: Years ended December 31(millions) 2017 2016 2015Revenue Total revenue $9,998 $9,409 $9,480Expenses Compensation and benefits 6,089 5,687 5,605Information technology 419 386 389Premises 348 343 362Depreciation of fixed assets 187 162 164Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 704 157 173Other general expenses 1,272 1,036 1,200Total operating expenses 9,019 7,771 7,893Operating income 979 1,638 1,587Interest income 27 9 14Interest expense (282) (282) (273)Other income (expense) (39) 36 100Income from continuing operations before income taxes 685 1,401 1,428Income taxes 250 148 175Net income from continuing operations 435 1,253 1,253Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 828 177 169Net income 1,263 1,430 1,422Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 37 34 37Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,226 $1,396 $1,385Consolidated Results for 2017 Compared to 2016 RevenueTotal revenue increased by 6%, or $589 million, to $10.0 billion in 2017, compared to $9.4 billion in 2016. The increase was driven by 4% organic revenue growth and a 2% increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Organic revenue growth for the year was driven by growth across every major revenue line, with particular strength in Reinsurance Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services.Commercial Risk Solutions organic revenue growth was 2% in 2017 driven by growth across nearly every geography, with particular strength in U.S. Retail driven by record new business generation and strong management of the renewal book portfolio.Reinsurance Solutions organic revenue growth was 6% in 2017 driven by growth across all major product lines, highlighted by continued net new business generation in the treaty portfolio, growth in facultative placements, and strong growth in capital markets.Retirement Solutions organic revenue growth was 3% in 2017 driven by double-digit growth in investment consulting, primarily for delegated investment management, as well as solid growth in the Talent, Rewards, and Performance practice.Health Solutions organic revenue growth was 7% in 2017 driven primarily by strong growth in health & benefits brokerage, in both the Americas and internationally.Data & Analytic Services organic revenue growth was 6% in 2017 driven by strong growth across Affinity, with particular strength in the U.S.29Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits increased $402 million in 2017, or 7%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $299 million of restructuring charges, a $154 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, and an increase in expense associated with 4% organic revenue growth, partially offset by $104 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives and a $92 million decrease in expenses related to certain pension settlements.Information TechnologyInformation technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, increased $33 million 2017, or 9%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $33 million of restructuring costs, a $7 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, as well as investments in growth, partially offset by $37 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.PremisesPremises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, increased $5 million in 2017, or 1%, compared to 2016.

Depreciation of fixed assets increased $25 million in 2017, or 15%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $26 million of restructuring costs and a $14 million increase in expenses associated with acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by $1 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives as well as a decrease as we continue to optimize our real estate and information technology portfolio. Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets Amortization and impairment of intangibles primarily relates to finite-lived tradenames and customer-related, contract-based, and technology assets. Amortization and impairment of intangibles increased $547 million for the year, or 348%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a $380 million non-cash impairment charge to the indefinite lived tradenames associated with the Divested Business, $143 million of accelerated amortization related to tradenames, and an increase associated with recent acquisitions, net of divestitures.Other General ExpensesOther general expenses increased $236 million in 2017, or 23%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $131 million of restructuring costs, a $71 million increase in expenses associated with acquisitions, net of divestitures, $28 million of costs related to regulatory and compliance matters, and an increase in expense associated with 4% organic revenue growth, partially offset by $20 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives and a $15 million decrease in expenses related to the sale of the Divested Business in the prior year period.Interest IncomeInterest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $27 million in 2017, an increase of $18 million, or 200%, from 2016, due primarily to additional income earned on the balance of cash proceeds from the Divested Business.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $282 million in 2017, similar to the prior year period.Other Income (Expense)Other income (expense) decreased $75 million from $36 million in 2016 to $(39) million in 2017. Other expense in 2017 includes, among other things, a $37 million unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and $16 million in net losses on the disposition of businesses, partially offset by $12 million of equity earnings and $2 million of gains on certain financial instruments. Other income in 2016 includes $39 million in net gains on the disposition of businesses and $13 million in equity earnings, partially offset by a $2 million unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and $14 million of losses on certain financial instruments.30Income From Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDue to factors discussed above, income from continuing operations before income taxes was $685 million in 2017, a 51% decrease from $1.4 billion in 2016. Income Taxes From Continuing OperationsThe effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 36.5% in 2017 and 10.6% in 2016. The 2017 rate reflects changes in the geographical distribution of income, the impact of share-based payments, and the provisional estimate of the impact of U.S. tax reform based on Aon's initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The 2016 rate reflects changes in the geographical distribution of income and the impact from certain pension settlements in the second and fourth quarters.Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxOn February 9, 2017, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Buyer to sell the Divested Business. The Company has retrospectively classified the results of the Divested Business as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $651 million to $828 million compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the gain on sale of the Divested Business.Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income attributable to Aon shareholders decreased to $1.2 billion, or $4.70 per diluted share, in 2017, compared to $1.4 billion, or $5.16 per diluted share, in 2016.Consolidated Results for 2016 Compared to 2015 RevenueTotal revenue decreased by 1%, or $71 million, to $9.4 billion in 2016, compared to $9.5 billion in 2015. The decrease was driven by a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 2% decrease related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by organic revenue growth of 4%.Commercial Risk Solutions organic revenue growth was 2% in 2016 driven by record business generation in U.S. retail and strong growth in Latin America, Asia, and Pacific regions, despite economic weakness in certain countries.Reinsurance Solutions organic revenue growth was 1% in 2016 driven by net new business growth in treaty placements globally and modest growth in facultative placements, partially offset by an unfavorable market impact in treaty and a decline in capital markets transactions and advisory business.Retirement Solutions organic revenue growth was 2% in 2016 driven by growth in investment consulting, primarily for delegated investment management.Health Solutions organic revenue growth was 13% in 2016 driven by solid growth in health & benefits brokerage, highlighted by double-digit growth across Asia and EMEA, and double-digit growth in healthcare exchanges. Data & Analytic Services organic revenue growth was 6% in 2016 driven by strong growth in Affinity, particularly in the U.S.Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits increased $82 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by a $220 million increase in non-cash expense related to certain pension settlements and an increase in expense associated with 4% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $169 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation and a $97 million decrease in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures.Information TechnologyInformation technology decreased $3 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by a $12 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation and a $7 million decrease in the core expense base resulting from acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 4% organic revenue growth.31PremisesPremises decreased $19 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by a $13 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Depreciation of Fixed AssetsDepreciation of fixed assets decreased $2 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by a $4 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation and a $4 million decrease in the core expenses associated with acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 4% organic revenue growth.Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets Amortization and impairment of intangibles decreased $16 million, or 9%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by an $8 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Other General ExpensesOther general expenses decreased $164 million, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by a $176 million decrease in expense related to legacy litigation incurred in 2015, a $43 million favorable impact from currency translation, and a $39 million decrease in the core expense base resulting from acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by an increase in expense to support 4% organic revenue growth, and $15 million of transaction costs related to the Divested Business.Interest IncomeInterest income was $9 million in 2016, a decrease of $5 million, or 36%, from 2015, due to marginally lower average interest rates globally.Interest ExpenseInterest expense was $282 million in 2016, an increase of $9 million, or 3%, from 2015. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects an increase in total debt outstanding.Other Income (Expense) Other income decreased $64 million from $100 million in 2015 to $36 million in 2016. Other income in 2016 includes $39 million in net gains on disposition of businesses and equity earnings of $13 million, partially offset by a $14 million net loss on certain financial instruments and foreign exchange losses of $2 million. Other income in 2015 includes, among other things, $82 million in net gains on disposition of businesses, foreign exchange gains of $30 million, and equity earnings of $13 million, partially offset by a $24 million net loss on certain financial instruments.Income From Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDue to the factors discussed above, income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1,401 million in 2016, a 2% decrease from $1,428 million in 2015.Income Taxes From Continuing OperationsThe effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 10.6% in 2016 and 12.3% in 2015. The 2016 and 2015 tax rates reflect changes in the geographical distribution of income, the impact from certain pension settlements in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, a reduction in U.S. income resulting from the settlement of legacy litigation in the second quarter of 2015, and the impact of certain discrete items. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxOn February 9, 2017, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Buyer to sell the Divested Business. The Company has retrospectively classified the results of the Divested Business as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $8 million in 2016, compared to $169 million in 2015, driven by increased operating income growth.Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income attributable to Aon Shareholders increased to $1,396 million, or $5.16 per diluted share in 2016, compared to $1,385 million, or $4.88 diluted net income per share, in 2015.32 Non-GAAP MetricsIn our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.Organic Revenue GrowthWe use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rate, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between subsidiaries, fiduciary investment income, and reimburseable expenses. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Twelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2017 Dec 31, 2016 % Change Less: Currency Impact (1) Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2) Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other Organic Revenue Growth (3)Commercial Risk Solutions $4,169 $3,929 6% — % —% 4 % 2%Reinsurance Solutions 1,429 1,361 5 — — (1) 6Retirement Solutions 1,755 1,707 3 (1) — 1 3Health Solutions 1,515 1,370 11 — — 4 7Data & Analytic Services 1,140 1,050 9 — — 3 6Elimination (10) (8) NA NA NA NA NATotal revenue $9,998 $9,409 6% — % —% 2 % 4% Twelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2016 Dec 31, 2015 % Change Less: Currency Impact (1) Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2) Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other Organic Revenue Growth (3)Commercial Risk Solutions $3,929 $4,029 (2)% (3)% —% (1)% 2%Reinsurance Solutions 1,361 1,358 — (1) — — 1Retirement Solutions 1,707 1,916 (11) (4) — (9) 2Health Solutions 1,370 1,167 17 (3) — 7 13Data & Analytic Services 1,050 1,021 3 (2) — (1) 6Elimination (8) (11) NA NA NA NA NATotal revenue $9,409 $9,480 (1)% (3)% —% (2)% 4%(1)Currency impact is determined by translating prior period's revenue at this period's foreign exchange rates.(2)Fiduciary investment income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively, was $32 million, $22 million, and $21 million. (3)Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, and fiduciary investment income.Adjusted Operating MarginWe use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.33A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported operating margins is as follows (in millions, except percentage data): Years ended December 31 2017 2016 2015Revenue $9,998 $9,409 $9,480 Operating income - as reported $979 $1,638 $1,587Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 704 157 173Restructuring 497 — —Regulatory and compliance matters 28 — —Pension settlement 128 220 —Transaction costs — 15 —Legacy litigation — — 176Operating income - as adjusted $2,336 $2,030 $1,936 Operating margin - as reported 9.8% 17.4% 16.7%Operating margin - as adjusted 23.4% 21.6% 20.4%Adjusted Diluted Earnings per ShareWe also use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the items identified above, plus related income taxes because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported Diluted earnings per share is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2017(millions, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Adjustments As AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations $979 $1,357 $2,336Interest income 27 — 27Interest expense (282) — (282)Other income (expense) (39) — (39)Income before income taxes from continuing operations 685 1,357 2,042Income taxes (1) 250 55 305Net income from continuing operations 435 1,302 1,737Income from discontinued operations, net of tax (2) 828 (772) 56Net income 1,263 530 1,793Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 37 — 37Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,226 $530 $1,756 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $1.53 $4.99 $6.52Discontinued operations 3.17 (2.95) 0.22Net income $4.70 $2.04 $6.74 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 260.7 — 260.734 Year Ended December 31, 2016(millions, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Adjustments As AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations $1,638 $392 $2,030Interest income 9 — 9Interest expense (282) — (282)Other income (expense) 36 — 36Income before income taxes from continuing operations 1,401 392 1,793Income taxes (1) 148 102 250Net income from continuing operations 1,253 290 1,543Income from discontinued operations, net of tax (2) 177 94 271Net income 1,430 384 1,814Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 34 — 34Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,396 $384 $1,780 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $4.51 $1.07 $5.58Discontinued operations 0.65 0.36 1.01Net income $5.16 $1.43 $6.59 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 270.3 — 270.3 Year Ended December 31, 2015(millions, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Adjustments As AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations $1,587 $349 $1,936Interest income 14 — 14Interest expense (273) — (273)Other income (expense) 100 — 100Income before income taxes from continuing operations 1,428 349 1,777Income taxes (1) 175 89 264Net income from continuing operations 1,253 260 1,513Income from discontinued operations, net of tax (2) 169 108 277Net income 1,422 368 1,790Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 37 — 37Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,385 $368 $1,753 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $4.28 $0.92 $5.20Discontinued operations 0.60 0.38 0.98Net income $4.88 $1.30 $6.18 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 283.8 — 283.8(1)The effective tax rate used in the U.S. GAAP financial statements for continuing operations were 36.5%, 10.6%, and 12.3%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Tax expense was adjusted to exclude the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the impact of the transition tax imposed on our accumulated foreign earnings and the re-measurement of the carrying value of our U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the lower corporate tax rate. The provisional estimate of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform is based on Aon’s initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and may be adjusted in future periods due to, among other things, additional analysis performed by Aon and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury (see Note 10 in these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). Further, adjusted items are generally taxed at the estimated annual effective 35tax rate, except for the applicable tax impact associated with estimated restructuring expenses, accelerated tradename amortization, impairment charges, regulatory and compliance provisions, and non-cash pension settlement charges, which are adjusted at the related jurisdictional rate. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact, the adjusted effective tax rates for continuing operations were 14.9%, 13.9%, and 14.9%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. (2)Adjusted income from discontinued operations, net of tax, excludes gain on sale and intangible asset amortization on discontinued operations of $1,964 million and $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted income from discontinued operations, net of tax, excludes intangible asset amortization on discontinued operations of $120 million and $141 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The effective tax rates used in the U.S. GAAP financial statements for discontinued operations were 58.9%, 34.0%, and 35.2%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with the gain on sale and intangible asset amortization, the adjusted effective tax rates for discontinued operations were 11.7%, 30.2%, and 31.1% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Free Cash FlowWe use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures.A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions):Years Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015Cash Provided by Continuing Operating Activities $669 $1,829 $1,502Capital Expenditures Used for Continuing Operations (183) (156) (200)Free Cash Flow Provided By Continuing Operations $486 $1,673 $1,302Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate FluctuationsWe conduct business in more than 120 countries and, because of this, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the last year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates. Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had an $0.12 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2017. Currency fluctuations had no impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2016, when 2015 results were translated at 2016 rates. Currency fluctuations had a $0.43 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2015, when 2014 results were translated at 2015 rates. Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a $0.08 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2017. Currency fluctuations had a $0.04 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2016, when 2015 results were translated at 2016 rates. Currency fluctuations had a $0.44 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2015, when 2014 results were translated at 2015 rates. These translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.36Restructuring PlanIn 2017, we initiated a global restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) in connection with the sale of the Divested Business. The Restructuring Plan is intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency, insight and connectivity. We expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations through 2019, including an estimated 4,200 to 4,800 role eliminations. We expect to result in cumulative costs of approximately $1,025 million through the end of the plan, consisting of approximately $450 million in employee termination costs, $130 million in technology rationalization costs, $85 million in real estate consolidation costs, $50 million in non-cash asset impairments, such as expense taken on software no longer in use, and $310 million in other costs including certain separation costs associated with the sale of the Divested Business. We estimate that our annualized savings from the Restructuring Plan and other operational improvement initiatives will be approximately $450 million by the end of 2019. From the inception of the Restructuring Plan through December 31, 2017, the Company has eliminated 2,630 positions and incurred total expenses of $497 million for restructuring and related separation costs. These charges are included in Compensation and benefits, Information technology, Premises, Depreciation of fixed assets, and Other general expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.The following table summarizes restructuring and separation costs by type that have been incurred through December 31, 2017 and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the Restructuring Plan (in millions). Estimated remaining costs may be revised in future periods as these assumptions are updated: Year Ended December 31, 2017 Estimated Remaining Costs Estimated Total Cost (1)Workforce reduction $299 $151 $450Technology rationalization (2) 33 97 130Lease consolidation (2) 8 77 85Asset impairments 26 24 50Other costs associated with restructuring and separation (2) (3) 131 179 310Total restructuring and related expenses $497 $528 $1,025(1)Actual costs, when incurred, may vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions that may change when plans are finalized and implemented include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause the Company to add or cancel component initiatives.(2)Contract termination costs included within Technology rationalization for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1 million. Contract termination costs included within Lease consolidations for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $8 million. Contact termination costs included within Other costs associated with restructuring and separation were $3 million. Total estimated contract termination costs to be incurred under the Restructuring Plan associated with Technology rationalizations, Lease consolidations, and Other costs associated with restructuring and separation, respectively, are $10 million, $80 million, and $10 million. (3)Other costs associated with the Restructuring Plan include those to separate the Divested Business, as well as moving costs and consulting and legal fees. These costs are generally recognized when incurred.37As of December 31, 2017, our liabilities for the Restructuring Plan were as follows (in millions): Restructuring PlanBalance at December 31, 2016 $—Expensed 452Cash payments (280)Foreign currency translation and other 14Balance at December 31, 2017 $186Competition and Markets AuthorityThe U.K.’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”), is conducting a market investigation into the supply and acquisition of investment consulting and fiduciary management services, including those offered by Aon and its competitors in the U.K. The CMA has indicated that it will assess whether any feature or combination of features in the target market prevents, restricts, or distorts competition. The CMA can impose a wide range of remedies to address uncompetitive markets. The investigation is in its early stages. Thus, we are not presently in a position to estimate the impact, if any, of this investigation on Aon’s UK investment business. Financial Conduct AuthorityThe FCA is conducting a market study to assess how effectively competition is working in the wholesale insurance broker sector in the UK in which Aon, through its subsidiaries, participates. The FCA has indicated that the purpose of a market study is to assess the extent to which the market is working well in the interests of customers and to identify features of the market that may impact competition. Depending on the study’s findings, the FCA may require remedies in order to correct any features found to be preventing, restricting or distorting competition. The study is in its very early stages and we are unable to estimate the impact, if any, on Aon’s business at this time. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityExecutive SummaryWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations, available cash reserves, and debt capacity available under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, and shareholder dividends. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future.Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds generally cannot be used for general corporate purposes and are not a source of liquidity for us.Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments increased $569 million to $1,285 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. During 2017, sources of funds in 2017 included proceeds from the sale of businesses of $4,246 million. During 2017, cash flow from operating activities decreased $1,160 million to $669 million. Additional primary uses of funds in 2017 included share repurchases of $2.4 billion, acquisitions of businesses of $1,029 million, dividends to shareholders of $364 million, repayments of debt, net of issuances of $345 million, and purchases of short-term investments of $232 million.To manage unforeseen situations, we have committed credit lines of approximately $1.3 billion and we endeavor to manage our obligations to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings. At December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings on these credit lines.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities during 2017 decreased $1,592 million, or 68%, to $734 million compared to 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations during 2017 decreased $1,160 million, or 63%, from the prior year, to $669 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations during 2017 decreased $432 million, or 87%, from the prior year, to $65 million. These amounts represent net income reported, as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses, financial instruments, and foreign exchange, and our non-cash expenses, which include share-based compensation, 38depreciation, amortization, and impairments, as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the collection of receivables. The total decrease in operating cash from the prior year was primarily driven by higher cash tax charges, largely related to the sale of the Divested Business, and an increase in pension contributions.Pension cash contributions were $146 million during 2017, as compared to $123 million during 2016. In 2018, we expect to contribute approximately $177 million to our pension plans, with the majority attributable to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates. On July 1, 2017, the Company made non-cash contributions of approximately $80 million to its U.S. pension plan.We expect cash generated by operations for 2017 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, repurchase shares under the Repurchase Program, and pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. We have committed credit facilities of approximately $1.3 billion, all of which was available at December 31, 2017, and can access these facilities on a same-day or next-day basis. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesNet cash flow provided by investing activities in 2017 was $2,787 million. The primary drivers of cash flow provided by investing activities were $4,246 million of sale of businesses and $4 million of net purchases of long-term investments, partially offset by $1,029 million for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, $232 million of net purchases of short-term investments, $183 million for capital expenditures from continuing operations and $19 million for capital expenditures from discontinued operations. Net cash flow used for investing activities in 2016 was $954 million. The primary drivers of cash flow used for investing activities were $879 million for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, $156 million for capital expenditures from continuing operations, $66 million for capital expenditures from discontinued operations, and $21 million of net purchases of long-term investments, partially offset by $107 million of sale of businesses and $61 million of net sales of short-term investments. Net cash flow used for investing activities in 2015 was $138 million. The primary drivers of cash flow used for investing activities were $200 million for capital expenditures from continuing operations, $90 million for capital expenditures from discontinued operations, $46 million of net purchases of long-term investments, and $16 million for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, partially offset by sales of businesses of $205 million and net sales of short-term investments of $9 million. Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesNet cash flow used for financing activities during 2017 was $3.3 billion. The primary drivers of cash used for financing activities were share repurchases of $2.4 billion, dividends paid to shareholders of $364 million, repayments of debt, net of issuances, of $345 million, and net cash payments of $121 million related to issuance of shares for employee benefit programs.Net cash flow used for financing activities during 2016 was $1.3 billion. The primary drivers of cash flow used for financing activities were share repurchases of $1.3 billion, dividends paid to shareholders of $345 million, and net cash payments of $129 million related to issuance of shares for employee benefit programs, partially offset by issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $522 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities during 2015 was $1.7 billion. The primary drivers of cash flow used for financing activities were $1.6 billion, dividends paid to shareholders of $323 million, and net cash payments of $30 million related to issuance of shares for employee benefit programs, partially offset by issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $253 million. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term InvestmentsAt December 31, 2017, our Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments were $1,285 million, an increase of $569 million from December 31, 2016, primarily related to proceeds from the sale of businesses of $4,246 million and $669 million in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, partially offset by share repurchases of $2,399 million, payments for the acquisition of businesses of $1,029 million, cash dividends of $364 million, the repayments of debt, net of issuances, of $345 million, and purchase of short-term investments of $232 million. Of the total balance as of December 31, 2017, $96 million was restricted as to its use, which was comprised of $57 million of operating funds in the U.K., as required by the FCA, and $39 million held as collateral for various business purposes. At December 31, 2017, $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and overdrawn cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.7 billion were held in other countries. We maintain multi-currency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall balance 39does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities were negative; however, the overall balance was positive.At December 31, 2016, our Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments were $716 million, a decrease of $22 million from December 31, 2015, primarily related to share repurchases of $1,257 million, payments for the acquisition of businesses of $879 million, dividends to shareholders of $345 million, and capital expenditures from continuing operations of $156 million, partially offset by $1,829 million in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, the net issuances of debt of $522 million, and proceeds for the sale of businesses of $107 million. Of the total balance as of December 31, 2016, $82 million was restricted as to its use, which was comprised of $53 million of operating funds in the U.K., as required by the FCA, and $29 million held as collateral for various business purposes. At December 31, 2016, $1.9 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments were held in the U.S. and overdrawn Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments of $1.2 billion were held in other countries. Due to differences in tax rates, the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S. could have an unfavorable tax impact. In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. In addition, some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly-rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the amount we report for Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities are equal. Our Fiduciary assets included cash and short-term investments of $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and fiduciary receivables of $5.9 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes.As disclosed in Note 15 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.As of December 31, 2017, our investments in money market funds had a fair value of $1.8 billion and are reported as Short-term investments or Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position depending on their nature.The following table summarizes our Fiduciary assets, non-fiduciary Cash and cash equivalents, and Short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions): Statement of Financial Position Classification Asset TypeCash and CashEquivalents Short-termInvestments FiduciaryAssets TotalCertificates of deposit, bank deposits or time deposits$756 $— $2,425 $3,181Money market funds— 529 1,318 1,847Cash and short-term investments756 529 3,743 5,028Fiduciary receivables— — 5,882 5,882Total$756 $529 $9,625 $10,910Share Repurchase ProgramThe Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with up to $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014 and February 2017 for a total of $15.0 billion in repurchase authorizations.Under the Repurchase Program, Class A Ordinary Shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based on prevailing market conditions, and will be funded from available capital. During 2017, the Company repurchased 18.0 million shares at an average price per share of $133.67, for a total cost of $2.4 billion and recorded an additional $12.0 million of costs associated with the repurchases to retained earnings. Included in the 18.0 million shares were 118 thousand shares that did not settle until January 2018. These shares were settled at an average price per share of $134.41 and total cost of $15.9 million. During 2016, the Company repurchased 12.2 million shares at an average price 40per share of $102.66 for a total cost of $1.3 billion and recorded an additional $6.0 million of costs associated with the repurchases to retained earnings. At December 31, 2017, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the Repurchase Program was $5.4 billion. Under the Repurchase Program, the Company has repurchased a total of 108.2 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $9.6 billion. For information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2017, see Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,” as previously described.DividendsDuring 2017, 2016, and 2015, we paid dividends of $364 million, $345 million, and $323 million, respectively, to holders of our Class A Ordinary Shares. Dividends paid per Class A Ordinary Share were $1.41, $1.29, and $1.15 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.Distributable ReservesAs a company incorporated in England and Wales, we are required under U.K. law to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company. Distributable reserves are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had distributable reserves in excess of $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. We believe that we will have sufficient distributable reserves to fund shareholder dividends, if and to the extent declared, for the foreseeable future.BorrowingsTotal debt at December 31, 2017 was $6.0 billion, a decrease of $239 million compared to December 31, 2016. Commercial paper activity during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:Years ended December 312017 2016Total Issuances$1,648 $2,710Total Repayments$(1,997) $(2,424)The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for short-term working capital needs.On May 27, 2016, $500 million of 3.125% Senior Notes due May 2016 issued by Aon Corporation matured and were repaid in full.On March 1, 2016, Aon plc issued $750 million of 3.875% Senior Notes due December 2025. The Company used the proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes.Credit FacilitiesAs of December 31, 2017, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding: its $900 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in February 2021 (the “2021 Facility”) and a $400 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2022 (the “2022 Facility”). The 2022 Facility was entered into on October 19, 2017. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA, tested quarterly. At December 31, 2017, we did not have borrowings under either the 2021 or the 2022 Facility, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.Shelf Registration StatementOn September 3, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, Class A Ordinary Shares, and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions and other factors.Rating Agency RatingsThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at February 20, 2018 appear in the table below.41 Senior Long-term Debt Commercial Paper OutlookStandard & Poor’sA- A-2 StableMoody’s Investor ServicesBaa2 P-2 StableFitch, Inc.BBB+ F-2 StableA downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to debt capital, reduce our financial flexibility, increase our commercial paper interest rates, or restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether, and/or impact future pension contribution requirements.Guarantees and IndemnificationsSale of the Divested BusinessIn connection with the sale of the Divested Business, we guaranteed future operating lease commitments related to certain facilities assumed by the Buyer. We are obligated to perform under the guarantees if the Divested Business defaults on the leases at any time during the remainder of the lease agreements, which expire on various dates through 2024. As of December 31, 2017, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the lease guarantee were $100 million, with an estimated fair value of $23 million.Additionally, we are subject to performance guarantee requirements under certain client arrangements that were assumed by the Buyer. Should the Divested Business fail to perform as required by the terms of the arrangements, we would be required to fulfill the remaining contract terms, which expire on various dates through 2023. As of December 31, 2017, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the performance guarantees were $212 million, which an estimated fair value of $1 million.Letters of Credit and Other GuaranteesWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit (“LOCs”). We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $96 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $90 million at December 31, 2016. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.We have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $95 million at December 31, 2017, which is unchanged as compared to December 31, 2016.Other Liquidity MattersWe do not have material exposure related to off balance sheet arrangements. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability, and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See Item 1, “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Contractual ObligationsSummarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017. Payments by year due are estimated as follows (in millions): Payments due in 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 2023 andbeyond TotalPrincipal payments on debt$299 $600 $400 $4,770 $6,069Interest payments on debt267 526 442 2,362 3,597Operating leases277 463 363 613 1,716Pension and other postretirement benefit plans181 388 281 757 1,607Purchase obligations191 192 30 33 446Total$1,215 $2,169 $1,516 $8,535 $13,43542Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and other regulations, as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions.In 2017, our principal U.K. subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the U.K. plans to contribute £44 million ($59 million at December 31, 2017 exchange rates) through 2019 which is estimated to bring the plan to 100% funded basis. Contributions were based on the 2016 valuation and no further contributions are forecasted after 2019. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated winding-up deficit was £122 million ($163 million at December 31, 2017 exchange rates). The trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the winding-up deficit be paid.Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts. Purchase obligations exclude $280 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when potential cash settlements will be made.Financial ConditionAt December 31, 2017, our net assets, representing total assets minus total liabilities, were $4.6 billion, a decrease from $5.5 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to share repurchases of $2.4 billion, and dividends to shareholders of $364 million, partially offset by Net income of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, and a decrease in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $416 million related primarily to foreign currency translation. Working capital increased by $271 million from $651 million at December 31, 2016 to $922 million at December 31, 2017.Accumulated Other Comprehensive LossAccumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $416 million to $3,496 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $3,912 million at December 31, 2016, which was primarily driven by the following:•positive net foreign currency translation adjustments of $385 million, which are attributable to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies; •a decrease of $19 million due to the amortization of net actuarial losses related to pension obligations; and•net financial instrument gains of $12 million.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESOur Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning restructuring, revenue recognition, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.RestructuringWorkforce reduction costsThe method used to account for workforce reduction costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan or are one-time costs. We account for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy, statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula. We recognize these costs when the likelihood of future settlement is probable and the amount of the related benefit is reasonably estimable, or on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period, if applicable.43We estimate our one-time workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated. We recognize these costs when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated, notify the employees who might be included in the termination, and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period. When employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period.Lease consolidation costsWhere we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it, we recognize a loss. The loss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we provide notice of cancellation in accordance with contractual terms, vacate the property, or sign a sublease arrangement. To determine the loss, we estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties. When we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee, we adjust our sublease losses for actual outcomes.Fair value concepts of one-time workforce reduction costs and lease lossesAccounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability. Where material, we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value. Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. For the remaining lease term, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount, if material. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded.Asset impairmentsAsset impairments are accounted for in the period when they become known. Furthermore, we record impairments by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows (in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream) or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life. Asset impairments are included in Depreciation of fixed assets in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other associated costs of exit and disposal activitiesWe recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred, including separation costs, moving costs and consulting and legal fees.Revenue RecognitionRevenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable. The Company considers revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when all of the following four conditions are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable, (3) delivery or performance has occurred, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. For brokerage commissions, revenue is typically recognized at the completion of the placement process or over a period of time based on the transfer of value to customers or as the remuneration becomes determinable, assuming all four criteria required to recognize revenue have been met. The placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy. Commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data.Fees paid by clients for consulting or other non-brokerage services are typically charged on an hourly, project, or fixed-fee basis. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed, assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met. Revenues from fixed-fee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportional-performance model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement. Revenues from investment income on funds held on behalf of clients are recognized as services are performed, assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues.Revenues from health care exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants, net of a reserve for estimated cancellations, assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met. 44PensionsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada, which are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted. In 2016 and 2017, we used a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans; this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. In 2015 and prior years, we had estimated these components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost by applying a single weighted-average discount rate, derived from the yield curve and used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.Recognition of gains and losses and prior service Certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost.Unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into Compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., the Netherlands, Canada, and U.K. plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.As of December 31, 2017, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.The following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2018 amortization of loss by country (millions, except amortization period): U.K. U.S. OtherUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses$1,236 $1,706 $452Amortization period9 - 29 6 - 24 13 - 40Estimated 2018 amortization of loss$30 $61 $12The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2017 was $5 million, $19 million, and $(7) million for the U.S., U.K. and other plans, respectively.For the U.S. pension plans, we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2017, the market-related value of assets was $1.9 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of plan assets was $2.0 billion.Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.45Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocationThe following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of December 31, 2017: U.K. U.S. OtherExpected return3.34% 7.71% 1.70 - 4.85%In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment-community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and other non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and other non-U.S. categories, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Target allocations are subject to change.Impact of changing economic assumptionsChanges in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2017 (in millions):Estimated liability discount rateIncrease (decrease) in projected benefit obligation of December 31, 2017 (1)25 bps Change in Discount RateIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(209) $223U.S. plans(95) 100Other plans(58) 67(1)Increases to the projected benefit obligation reflect increases to our pension obligations, while decreases in the projected benefit obligation are recoveries toward fully-funded status. A change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the projected benefit obligation.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our estimated 2018 pension expense (in millions): 25 bps Change in Discount RateIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(2) $1U.S. plans1 (1)Other plans— —Holding other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2018 pension expense (in millions): 25 bps Change in Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(15) $15U.S. plans(5) 5Other plans(3) 346Estimated future contributionsWe estimate cash contributions of approximately $177 million to our pension plans in 2018 as compared with cash contributions of $146 million in 2017.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames, customer-related and contract-based, or technology and other.Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we also test the acquired tradenames for impairment. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. No events occurred during 2017 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames.We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.The goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, including goodwill, of the corresponding reporting unit. If the “more likely than not” threshold is not met, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two-step analysis. Step 1 requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step 2. Step 2 uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in Step 1 and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value.In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. Based on tests performed in both 2017 and 2016, there was no indication of goodwill impairment, and no further testing was required.We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2017. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.ContingenciesWe define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection.47Share-Based PaymentsShare-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Restricted Share UnitsRestricted share units (“RSUs”) are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.Performance Share AwardsPerformance share awards (“PSAs”) are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.Compensation cost is recognized over the performance period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.The largest performance-based share-based payment award plan is the Leadership Performance Plan (“LPP”), which has a three-year performance period. The 2015 to 2017 performance period ended on December 31, 2017, the 2014 to 2016 performance period ended on December 31, 2016 and the 2013 to 2015 performance period ended on December 31, 2015. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2016 to 2018 and 2017 to 2019. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2017 expense by approximately $5.9 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $5.9 million. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense.Income TaxesWe earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies, and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In this assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination. We base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that impact the Company, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings (the “Transition Tax”), among others. The Company is required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, including the determination of the transition tax and re-measuring of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“SAB 118”), which allows registrants to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Reform Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting 48interpretation is expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for certain items to be provisional due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. The Company expects to complete its analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. See Note 10 in these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and a detailed description of the items for which the accounting is provisional.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if determinable.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.Foreign Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign exchange rate risk. Our primary exposures include exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar, the Indian Rupee, and the Japanese Yen. We use over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements.Additionally, some of our non-U.S. brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in U.S. Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen, but most of their expenses are incurred in British Pounds. At December 31, 2017, we have hedged approximately 45% of our U.K. subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the U.S. Dollar, Euro, and Japanese Yen transactions for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively. We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years.We also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures, such as inter-company notes and short-term assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency and are subject to remeasurement.The potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would be $31 million and $14 million at December 31, 2018 and 2019 respectively.Interest Rate RiskOur fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates, and as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the North America, continental Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $41.6 million to each of 2018 and 2019 pretax income. A corresponding increase in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase, net of derivative positions, of $41.6 million to each of 2018 and 2019 pretax income.We have long-term debt outstanding with a fair market value of $6.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016. This fair value was greater than the carrying value by $600 million at December 31, 2017, and $395 million greater than the carrying value at December 31, 2016. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 8% or an increase of 9%, respectively, at December 31, 2017.We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events.49",2023-12-30 20:32:49.512179
315293,AON,Aon plc,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTSAon is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions underpinned by proprietary data and analytics. Management is leading a set of initiatives designed to strengthen Aon and unite the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by proprietary data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.Financial Results In the first quarter of 2018, Aon adopted new accounting guidance related to the treatment of revenue from contracts with customers that was applied prospectively on the U.S. GAAP financial statements and therefore comparable periods have not been restated. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” for further information surrounding the quantitative and qualitative impacts of adopting the new accounting guidance.The following is a summary of our 2018 financial results from continuing operations on a reported basis:•Revenue increased $772 million, or 8%, to $10,770 million in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting 5% organic revenue growth, a 2% increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, and a 1% favorable impact from translating prior year period results at current period foreign exchange rates (“foreign currency translation”). Organic revenue growth for the year was driven by growth across every major revenue line, with particular strength in Reinsurance Solutions, Commercial Risk Solutions, and Health Solutions.•Operating expenses increased $293 million, or 3%, to $9,226 million in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to a $172 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, a $75 million increase in expense related to legacy litigation, $71 million of accelerated amortization related to tradenames, a $59 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, a $14 million increase in expense to support GDPR compliance, and an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $204 million net decrease in impairment charges, $195 million of incremental savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives, and a $28 million decrease in regulatory and compliance costs.•Operating margin increased to 14.3% in 2018 from 10.7% in 2017, including an increase of 90 basis points resulting from adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. The underlying increase in operating margin from the prior year is primarily driven by organic revenue growth of 5% and strong core operational improvement, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, described above.•Due to the factors set forth above, net income from continuing operations was $1,100 million in 2018, an increase of $665 million, or 153%, from 2017. •Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.29 per share during the twelve months of 2018 compared to $1.53 per share for the prior year period, including an increase of $0.32 per share resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.•Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,686 million in 2018, an increase of $1,017 million, or 152%, from $669 million in 2017. The prior year included $940 million of cash tax payments related to the sale of the Divested Business. Strong operational improvement and working capital improvements in both receivables and payables contributed to year-over-year growth, partially offset by $145 million of incremental cash restructuring charges and $80 million of accelerated pension contributions.We focus on four key non-GAAP metrics that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margins, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto (the “Financial Statements”). The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics from continuing operations for 2018:•Organic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 5% in 2018, compared to 4% organic growth in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was driven by growth across every major revenue line, with particular strength in Reinsurance Solutions, Commercial Risk Solutions, and Health Solutions.•Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 25.0% in 2018, compared to 22.8% in the prior year. The increase in adjusted 26operating margin primarily reflects organic revenue growth of 5%, core operational improvement, and $195 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.•Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $8.16 per share in 2018, an increase of $1.69 per share, or 26%, from $6.47 per share in 2017. The increase demonstrates strong operational performance and effective capital management, highlighted by $1.4 billion of share repurchase during 2018, partially offset by a higher adjusted effective tax rate.•Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $1,446 million in 2018, an increase of $960 million, or 198%, from $486 million in 2017, driven by an increase of $1,017 million in cash flow in operations, partially offset by a $57 million increase in capital expenditures, including investments in our operating model.REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTSSummary of ResultsIn the first quarter of 2018, Aon adopted new accounting guidance related to the treatment of revenue from contracts with customers that was applied prospectively on the U.S. GAAP financial statements and therefore comparable periods have not been restated. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” for further information surrounding the quantitative and qualitative impacts of adopting the new accounting guidance.Our consolidated results are as follow: Years ended December 31(millions) 2018 2017 2016Revenue Total revenue $10,770 $9,998 $9,409Expenses Compensation and benefits 6,103 6,003 5,514Information technology 484 419 386Premises 370 348 343Depreciation of fixed assets 176 187 162Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 593 704 157Other general expenses 1,500 1,272 1,036Total operating expenses 9,226 8,933 7,598Operating income 1,544 1,065 1,811Interest income 5 27 9Interest expense (278) (282) (282)Other income (expense) (25) (125) (137)Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,246 685 1,401Income taxes 146 250 148Net income from continuing operations 1,100 435 1,253Net income from discontinued operations 74 828 177Net income 1,174 1,263 1,430Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 40 37 34Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,134 $1,226 $1,396Consolidated Results for 2018 Compared to 2017 RevenueTotal revenue increased $772 million, or 8%, to $10,770 million in 2018, compared to $9,998 million in 2017. The increase was driven by 5% organic revenue growth, a 2% increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, and a 1% favorable impact 27from foreign currency translation. Organic revenue growth for the year was driven by growth across every major revenue line, with particular strength in Reinsurance Solutions, Commercial Risk Solutions, and Health Solutions.Commercial Risk Solutions revenue increased $483 million, or 12%, to $4,652 million in 2018, compared to $4,169 million in 2017. Organic revenue growth was 6% in 2018 driven by growth across every major geography, with particular strength in U.S. Retail driven by record new business generation and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. Results also include double-digit growth in both cyber solutions and transaction liability, two specific areas of investment to support increasing client demand.Reinsurance Solutions revenue increased $134 million, or 9%, to $1,563 million in 2018, compared to $1,429 million in 2017. Organic revenue growth was 7% in 2018 driven by net new business generation in treaty and strong growth in facultative placements, partially offset by a modest decline in capital markets transactions given the prior year period benefited from record catastrophe bond issuance during the mid-year renewal season.Retirement Solutions revenue increased $110 million, or 6%, to $1,865 million in 2018, compared to $1,755 million in 2017. Organic revenue growth was 2% in 2018 driven by solid growth in core actuarial retirement and in the talent practice, as well as modest growth in investment consulting.Health Solutions revenue increased $81 million, or 5%, to $1,596 million in 2018, compared to $1,515 million in 2017. Organic revenue growth was 5% in 2018 driven primarily by strong growth in health & benefits brokerage, in both the Americas and internationally, and in the health care exchange business driven by new client wins in both the active and retiree exchanges.Data & Analytic Services revenue decreased $35 million, or 3%, to $1,105 million in 2018, compared to $1,140 million in 2017. Organic revenue growth was 3% in 2018 driven by strong growth globally across Affinity.Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits increased $100 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $145 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, a $50 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, and an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $184 million decrease in restructuring costs, $182 million of incremental savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives, and a $51 million decrease related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018.Information TechnologyInformation technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, increased $65 million, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $16 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, a $14 million increase in restructuring costs, an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth, and investments supporting long-term growth initiatives, partially offset by $1 million of incremental savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.PremisesPremises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, increased $22 million, or 6%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $20 million increase in restructuring costs, and a $10 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by $16 million of incremental savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.Depreciation of Fixed AssetsDepreciation of fixed assets primarily relates to software, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, computer equipment, buildings, and automobiles. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $11 million, or 6%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a $13 million decrease in restructuring costs, partially offset by a $4 million increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets Amortization and impairment of intangibles primarily relates to finite-lived tradenames and customer-related, contract-based, and technology assets. Amortization and impairment of intangibles decreased $111 million, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a net $204 million decrease in impairment charges, partially offset by a $71 million increase in accelerated amortization related to tradenames.28Other General ExpensesOther general expenses increased $228 million, or 18%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $151 million increase in restructuring costs, a $75 million increase in legacy litigation, an $11 million increase in expense to support GDPR regulatory compliance, and an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $28 million decrease in costs related to regulatory and compliance matters.Interest IncomeInterest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $5 million in 2018, a decrease of $22 million, or 81%, from 2017, due primarily to additional income earned on the balance of cash proceeds from the Divested Business in the prior year period.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $278 million in 2018, a decrease of $4 million, or 1%, from 2017. This decrease was driven primarily by the maturity of higher interest rate term debt in Q1 2018 partially offset by interest on a higher average commercial paper outstanding compared to the prior year. Other Income (Expense)Other expense decreased $100 million, or 80%, to $25 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Other expense in 2018 includes, among other things, $49 million of losses on certain financial instruments and $6 million in net losses on the disposition of businesses, partially offset by a $25 million favorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and $4 million of equity earnings. Other expense in 2017 includes $86 million of pension and other post-retirement expense, a $37 million unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, and $16 million in net losses on the disposition of businesses, partially offset by $12 million in equity earnings.Income From Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDue to factors discussed above, income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1,246 million in 2018, an 82% increase from $685 million in 2017. Income Taxes From Continuing OperationsThe effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 11.7% in 2018 and 36.5% in 2017. The primary drivers of the 2018 tax rate include the following:•The geographical distribution of income including restructuring charges, legacy litigation, and the impairment of certain assets and liabilities previously classified as held for sale as well as the post-enactment date impacts of the Tax Reform Act.•Certain discrete items including the tax benefit associated with the sale of certain assets and liabilities previously classified as held for sale and the impact of share-based payments offset by the net tax expense from finalizing the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act and changes in valuation allowances.The 2017 tax rate reflects changes in the geographical distribution of income including restructuring charges and the impairment and amortization of tradenames, the impact of share-based payments, and the provisional estimate of the enactment date impact of the Tax Reform Act.Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxNet income from discontinued operations decreased $754 million to $74 million compared to 2017 due to the execution of the sale of the Divested Business on May 2, 2017.Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income attributable to Aon shareholders decreased to $1,134 million, or $4.59 per diluted share, in 2018, compared to $1,226 million, or $4.70 per diluted share, in 2017.29Consolidated Results for 2017 Compared to 2016 RevenueTotal revenue increased by 6%, or $589 million, to $9,998 million in 2017, compared to $9,409 million in 2016. The increase was driven by 4% organic revenue growth and a 2% increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures.

Organic revenue growth was 6% in 2017 driven by strong growth across Affinity, with particular strength in the U.S.Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits increased $489 million in 2017, or 9%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $299 million of restructuring charges, a $154 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, and an increase in expense associated with 4% organic revenue growth, partially offset by $104 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives and a $92 million decrease in expenses related to certain pension settlements.Information TechnologyInformation technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, increased $33 million in 2017, or 9%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $33 million of restructuring costs, a $7 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, as well as investments in growth, partially offset by $37 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.PremisesPremises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, increased $5 million in 2017, or 1%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an $11 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, and $8 million of restructuring costs, partially offset by $3 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.Depreciation of Fixed AssetsDepreciation of fixed assets primarily relates to software, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, computer equipment, buildings, and automobiles. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $25 million in 2017, or 15%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $26 million of restructuring costs and a $14 million increase in expenses associated with acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by $1 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives as well as a decrease as we continue to optimize our real estate and information technology portfolio. Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets Amortization and impairment of intangibles primarily relates to finite-lived tradenames and customer-related, contract-based, and technology assets. Amortization and impairment of intangibles increased $547 million for the year, or 348%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a $380 million non-cash impairment charge to the indefinite lived tradenames associated with the Divested Business, $143 million of accelerated amortization related to tradenames, and an increase associated with recent acquisitions, net of divestitures.30Other General ExpensesOther general expenses increased $236 million in 2017, or 23%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $131 million of restructuring costs, a $71 million increase in expenses associated with acquisitions, net of divestitures, $28 million of costs related to regulatory and compliance matters, and an increase in expense associated with 4% organic revenue growth, partially offset by $20 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives and a $15 million decrease in expenses related to the sale of the Divested Business in the prior year period.Interest IncomeInterest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $27 million in 2017, an increase of $18 million, or 200%, from 2016, due primarily to additional income earned on the balance of cash proceeds from the Divested Business.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $282 million in 2017, similar to the prior year period.Other Income (Expense)Other expense decreased $12 million from $137 million in 2016 to $125 million in 2017. Other expense in 2017 includes, among other things, $86 million of pension and other post-retirement expense, a $37 million unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, and $16 million in net losses on the disposition of businesses, partially offset by $12 million in equity earnings. Other expense in 2016 includes $173 million of pension and other post-retirement expense and $14 million of losses on certain financial instruments, partially offset by $39 million in net gains on the disposition of businesses and $13 million in equity earnings.Income From Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDue to factors discussed above, income from continuing operations before income taxes was $685 million in 2017, a 51% decrease from $1,401 million in 2016. Income Taxes From Continuing OperationsThe effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 36.5% in 2017 and 10.6% in 2016. The 2017 rate reflects changes in the geographical distribution of income, the impact of share-based payments, and the provisional estimate of the impact of U.S. tax reform based on Aon's initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The 2016 rate reflects changes in the geographical distribution of income and the impact from certain pension settlements in the second and fourth quarters.Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxOn February 9, 2017, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Buyer to sell the Divested Business. The Company has retrospectively classified the results of the Divested Business as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $651 million to $828 million compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the gain on sale of the Divested Business.Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income attributable to Aon shareholders decreased to $1,226 million, or $4.70 per diluted share, in 2017, compared to $1,396 million, or $5.16 per diluted share, in 2016. Non-GAAP MetricsIn our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Financial Statements.Organic Revenue GrowthWe use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, changes in foreign exchange rates, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and fiduciary investment income. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our 31Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Twelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 % Change Revenue Recognition(1) Less: Currency Impact (2) Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (3) Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other Organic Revenue Growth (4)Commercial Risk Solutions $4,652 $4,169 12 % — % 1% —% 5 % 6%Reinsurance Solutions 1,563 1,429 9 (1) 2 1 — 7Retirement Solutions 1,865 1,755 6 — 1 — 3 2Health Solutions 1,596 1,515 5 (1) — — 1 5Data & Analytic Services 1,105 1,140 (3) — — — (6) 3Elimination (11) (10) NA NA NA NA NA NATotal revenue $10,770 $9,998 8 % — % 1% —% 2 % 5% Twelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2017 Dec 31, 2016 % Change Less: Currency Impact (2) Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (3) Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other Organic Revenue Growth (4)Commercial Risk Solutions $4,169 $3,929 6% — % —% 4 % 2%Reinsurance Solutions 1,429 1,361 5 — — (1) 6Retirement Solutions 1,755 1,707 3 (1) — 1 3Health Solutions 1,515 1,370 11 — — 4 7Data & Analytic Services 1,140 1,050 9 — — 3 6Elimination (10) (8) NA NA NA NA NATotal revenue $9,998 $9,409 6% — % —% 2 % 4%(1)Revenue Recognition represents the impact of Aon’s adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, effective for Aon in the first quarter of 2018.(2)Currency impact is determined by translating prior period's revenue at this period's foreign exchange rates.(3)Fiduciary investment income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, was $53 million, $32 million, and $22 million. (4)Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, changes in foreign exchange rates, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and fiduciary investment income.Adjusted Operating MarginWe use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Financial Statements.32A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported operating margins is as follows (in millions, except percentage data): Years ended December 31 2018 2017 2016Revenue from continuing operations $10,770 $9,998 $9,409 Operating income from continuing operations - as reported $1,544 $1,065 $1,811Amortization and impairment of intangible assets(3) 593 704 157Restructuring 485 497 —Legacy litigation 75 — —Regulatory and compliance matters — 28 —Transaction costs — — 15Operating income from continuing operations - as adjusted $2,697 $2,294 $1,983 Operating margin from continuing operations - as reported 14.3% 10.7% 19.2%Operating margin from continuing operations - as adjusted 25.0% 22.9% 21.1%Adjusted Diluted Earnings per ShareWe also use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the items identified above, plus related income taxes because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Financial Statements.A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported Diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share data and percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2018(millions, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations $1,544 $1,153 $2,697Interest income 5 — 5Interest expense (278) — (278)Other income (expense) (1) (25) 37 12Income before income taxes from continuing operations 1,246 1,190 2,436Income taxes (2) 146 233 379Net income from continuing operations 1,100 957 2,057Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (3) 74 (82) (8)Net income 1,174 875 2,049Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 40 — 40Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,134 $875 $2,009 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $4.29 $3.87 $8.16Discontinued operations 0.30 (0.33) (0.03)Net income $4.59 $3.54 $8.13 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 247.0 — 247.0Effective tax rates (3) Continuing operations - U.S. GAAP 11.7% 15.6%Discontinued operations - U.S. GAAP 15,949.3% 29.7%33 Year Ended December 31, 2017(millions, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations $1,065 $1,229 $2,294Interest income 27 — 27Interest expense (282) — (282)Other income (expense) (1) (125) 128 3Income before income taxes from continuing operations 685 1,357 2,042Income taxes (2) 250 55 305Net income from continuing operations 435 1,302 1,737Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (3) 828 (772) 56Net income 1,263 530 1,793Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 37 — 37Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,226 $530 $1,756 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $1.53 $4.99 $6.52Discontinued operations 3.17 (2.95) 0.22Net income $4.70 $2.04 $6.74 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 260.7 — 260.7Effective tax rates (3) Continuing operations - U.S. GAAP 36.5% 14.9%Discontinued operations - U.S. GAAP 58.9% 11.7% Year Ended December 31, 2016(millions, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations $1,811 $172 $1,983Interest income 9 — 9Interest expense (282) — (282)Other income (expense) (1) (137) 220 83Income before income taxes from continuing operations 1,401 392 1,793Income taxes (2) 148 102 250Net income from continuing operations 1,253 290 1,543Net income from discontinued operations (3) 177 94 271Net income 1,430 384 1,814Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 34 — 34Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,396 $384 $1,780 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $4.51 $1.07 $5.58Discontinued operations 0.65 0.36 1.01Net income $5.16 $1.43 $6.59 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 270.3 — 270.3Effective tax rates (3) Continuing operations - U.S. GAAP 10.6% 13.9%Discontinued operations - U.S. GAAP 34.0% 30.2%34(1)Adjusted Other income (expense) excludes Pension settlement charges of $37 million, $128 million, and $220 million, for the years ended 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.(2)Adjusted items are generally taxed at the estimated annual effective tax rate, except for the applicable tax impact associated with estimated Restructuring Plan expenses, legacy litigation, accelerated tradename amortization, impairment charges and non-cash pension settlement charges, which are adjusted at the related jurisdictional rates. In addition, tax expense excludes the tax impacts from the sale of certain assets and liabilities previously classified as held for sale as well as the tax adjustments recorded to finalize the 2017 accounting for the enactment date impact of the Tax Reform Act recorded pursuant to SAB 118.(3)Adjusted net income from discontinued operations excludes the gain on sale of discontinued operations of $82 million, $779 million, and $0 million for the years ended 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Adjusted net income from discontinued operations excludes intangible asset amortization of $0 million, $11 million, and $120 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate was further adjusted for the applicable tax impact associated with the gain on sale and intangible asset amortization, as applicable.Free Cash FlowWe use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Financial Statements. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions):Years Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016Cash Provided by Continuing Operating Activities $1,686 $669 $1,829Capital Expenditures Used for Continuing Operations (240) (183) (156)Free Cash Flow Provided By Continuing Operations $1,446 $486 $1,673Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate FluctuationsWe conduct business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties and, because of this, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the prior year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates. Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a $0.08 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2018. Currency fluctuations had a $0.12 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2017, when 2016 results were translated at 2017 rates. Currency fluctuations had no impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2016, when 2015 results were translated at 2016 rates. Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a $0.09 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2018. Currency fluctuations had a $0.08 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2017, when 2016 results were translated at 2017 rates. Currency fluctuations had a $0.04 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2016, when 2015 results were translated at 2016 rates. These translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the Financial Statements.Competition and Markets AuthorityThe U.K.’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”), conducted a market investigation into the supply and acquisition of investment consulting and fiduciary management services, including those offered by Aon and its competitors in the U.K., to assess whether any feature or combination of features in the target market prevents, restricts, or distorts competition. The CMA issued a final report on December 12, 2018. The CMA will draft a series of orders that will set out the detailed remedies, expected in first quarter of 2019, when they will be subject to further public consultation. We do not anticipate the remedies to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or business.Financial Conduct AuthorityThe FCA is conducting a market study to assess how effectively competition is working in the wholesale insurance broker sector in the U.K. in which Aon, through its subsidiaries, participates. The FCA has indicated that the purpose of a market study is to assess the extent to which the market is working well in the interests of customers and to identify features of the market that may impact competition. Depending on the study’s findings, the FCA may require remedies in order to correct any features found 35to be preventing, restricting, or distorting competition. The study is ongoing and we are unable to estimate the impact, if any, on Aon’s business at this time.LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityExecutive SummaryWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves, and debt capacity available under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, restructuring activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, and shareholder dividends. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future.Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums and claims in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities. In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. In addition, some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the amount we report for Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities are equal. Our Fiduciary assets included cash and short-term investments of $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and fiduciary receivables of $6.3 billion and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes.We maintain multicurrency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2018, non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities were negative; however, the overall balance was positive.The following table summarizes our Fiduciary assets, non-fiduciary Cash and cash equivalents, and Short-term investments as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): Statement of Financial Position Classification Asset TypeCash and CashEquivalents Short-termInvestments FiduciaryAssets TotalCertificates of deposit, bank deposits or time deposits$656 $— $2,279 $2,935Money market funds— 172 1,587 1,759Cash and short-term investments656 172 3,866 4,694Fiduciary receivables— — 6,300 6,300Total$656 $172 $10,166 $10,99436Cash and cash equivalents decreased $100 million in 2018 compared to 2017. A summary of our cash flows provided by and used for continuing operations from operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31 2018 2017Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations $1,686 $669Cash provided by investing activities - continuing operations $31 $2,806Cash used for financing activities - continuing operations $(1,699) $(3,265)Effect of exchange rates changes on cash and cash equivalents $(118) $69Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased $1,017 million, or 152%, from the prior year to $1,686 million. This amount represents net income reported, as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, amortization and impairments, and other non-cash income and expenses, as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the collection of receivables.Pension ContributionsPension cash contributions were $252 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, which includes our acceleration of contributions to the qualified U.S. pension plan, as compared to cash contributions of $146 million and a non-cash contribution of $80 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. In 2019, we expect to contribute approximately $145 million to our pension plans, with the majority attributable to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates. Restructuring PlanIn 2017, we initiated a global restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) in connection with the sale of the Divested Business. The Restructuring Plan is intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency, insight, and connectivity. We expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations through 2019, including an estimated 4,800 to 5,400 role eliminations. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we expanded the Restructuring Plan, which resulted in additional expected costs of approximately $200 million, consisting of $150 million of cash investment and $50 million of non-cash charges. Annualized estimated savings increased $50 million as a result of the expanded program. We do not expect any further adjustments to the total estimated program costs or annualized savings through the remainder of the program, which will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019.We expect the Restructuring Plan to result in cumulative costs of approximately $1,225 million through the end of the plan, consisting of approximately $450 million in employee termination costs, $130 million in technology rationalization costs, $65 million in real estate consolidation costs, $50 million in non-cash asset impairments, such as expense taken on software no longer in use, and $530 million in other costs including certain separation costs associated with the sale of the Divested Business. We estimate that our annualized savings from the Restructuring Plan and other operational improvement initiatives will be approximately $500 million by the end of 2019. The following table summarizes restructuring and separation costs by type that have been incurred through December 31, 2018 and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the Restructuring Plan (in millions). Estimated remaining costs by type may be revised in future periods as these assumptions are updated: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Inception to Date Estimated Remaining Costs Estimated Total Cost (1)Workforce reduction $115 $414 $36 $450Technology rationalization (2) 47 80 50 130Lease consolidation (2) 28 36 29 65Asset impairments 13 39 11 50Other costs associated with restructuring and separation (2) (3) 282 413 117 530Total restructuring and related expenses $485 982 $243 $1,22537(1)Actual costs, when incurred, may vary due to changes in the assumptions built into the Restructuring Plan. Significant assumptions that may change when plans are finalized and implemented include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause the Company to add or cancel component initiatives.(2)Total contract termination costs incurred under the Restructuring Plan associated with Technology rationalizations, Lease consolidations, and Other costs associated with restructuring and separation, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were $5 million, $25 million, and $85 million; and since inception of the Restructuring Plan, were $6 million, $33 million, and $88 million, respectively. Total estimated contract termination costs expected to be incurred under the Restructuring Plan associated with Technology rationalizations, Lease consolidations, and Other costs associated with restructuring and separation, respectively, are $15 million, $80 million, and $95 million.(3)Other costs associated with the Restructuring Plan include those to separate the Divested Business, as well as moving costs and consulting and legal fees. These costs are generally recognized when incurred.As of December 31, 2018, our liabilities for the Restructuring Plan were as follows (in millions): Restructuring PlanBalance at December 31, 2017 $186Expensed 448Cash payments (425)Foreign currency translation and other (8)Balance at December 31, 2018 $201Investing ActivitiesCash flow provided by investing activities in continuing operations was $31 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $2,775 million compared to prior year. The primary drivers of cash flow used for investing activities are acquisition of businesses, purchases of short-term investments, capital expenditures, and payments for investments. The primary drivers of cash flow provided by investing activities are sales of businesses, sales of short-term investments, and proceeds from investments. The gains and losses corresponding to cash flows provided by proceeds from investments and used for payments for investments are primarily recognized in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Short-term InvestmentsShort-term investments decreased $357 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. As disclosed in Note 16 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” of the Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.Acquisitions and Dispositions of BusinessesDuring 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of eight businesses for consideration of $58 million, net of cash acquired, and completed the disposition of four business for a net cash outflow of $10 million.During 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of seventeen businesses for consideration of $1,029 million, net of cash acquired, and the sale of nine businesses for $4,246 million.Capital ExpendituresThe Company’s additions to fixed assets, including capitalized software, which amounted to $240 million in 2018 and $183 million in 2017, primarily related to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, and software development costs. Financing ActivitiesCash flow used for financing activities in continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $1,699 million, an increase of $1,566 million compared to prior year. The primary drivers of cash flow used for financing activities are share repurchases, issuances of debt, net of repayments, dividends paid to shareholders, issuances of shares for employee benefit plans, transactions with noncontrolling interests, and other financing activities.Share Repurchase ProgramAon has a share repurchase program authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014 and February 2017, for a total of $15.0 billion in repurchase authorizations.38The following table summarizes the Company’s Share Repurchase activity (in millions, except per share data): Twelve months ended December 31 2018 2017 (1)Shares repurchased 10.0 18.0Average price per share $143.94 $133.67Costs recorded to retained earnings Total repurchase cost $1,447 $2,403Additional associated costs 7 12Total costs recorded to retained earnings $1,454 $2,415(1)Included in the 18.0 million shares repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were 0.1 million shares that did not settle until January 2018. These shares were settled at an average price per share of $134.41 and total cost of $15.9 million.At December 31, 2018, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the Repurchase Program was approximately $4.0 billion. Under the Repurchase Program, the Company has repurchased a total of 118.3 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $11.0 billion.BorrowingsTotal debt at December 31, 2018 was $6.2 billion, an increase of $278 million compared to December 31, 2017. Commercial paper activity during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in millions): Twelve months ended December 31 2018 2017Total issuances(1)$5,400 $1,648Total repayments(5,118) (1,997)Net issuances$282 $(349)(1) The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for short-term working capital needs.On December 3, 2018, Aon Corporation issued $350 million 4.50% Senior Notes due December 2028. The Company used the proceeds for general corporate purposes. On March 8, 2018 the Company’s CAD 375 million ($291 million at March 8, 2018 Exchange Rates) 4.76% Senior Notes due March 2018 issued by a Canadian subsidiary of Aon Corporation matured and was repaid in full.Other Liquidity MattersDistributable ReservesAs a company incorporated in England and Wales, we are required under U.K. law to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company and, among other methods, through a reduction in share capital approved by the courts of England and Wales. Distributable reserves are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had distributable reserves in excess of $2.2 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. We believe that we will have sufficient distributable reserves to fund shareholder dividends and make share repurchases for the foreseeable future.Credit FacilitiesWe expect cash generated by operations for 2018 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, continue purchases of shares under the Repurchase Program, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.39As of December 31, 2018, we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: our $900 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in February 2021 (the “2021 Facility”) and our $400 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2022 (the “2022 Facility”). On February 2, 2019, we extended the 2021 Facility by one year, and it will now expire in February 2022.Each of these facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, in each case, tested quarterly. At December 31, 2018, we did not have borrowings under either the 2021 Facility or the 2022 Facility, and we were in compliance with all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Shelf Registration StatementOn September 25, 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, Class A Ordinary Shares, and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.Rating Agency RatingsThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at February 19, 2019 appear in the table below. Ratings Senior Long-term Debt Commercial Paper OutlookStandard & Poor’sA- A-2 StableMoody’s Investor ServicesBaa2 P-2 StableFitch, Inc.BBB+ F-2 StableA downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to debt capital, reduce our financial flexibility, or restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether, and/or impact future pension contribution requirements.Guarantees in Connection with the Sale of the Divested BusinessIn connection with the sale of the Divested Business, we guaranteed future operating lease commitments related to certain facilities assumed by the Buyer. We are obligated to perform under the guarantees if the Divested Business defaults on the leases at any time during the remainder of the lease agreements, which expire on various dates through 2024. As of December 31, 2018, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the lease guarantee were $85 million, with an estimated fair value of $17 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the lease commitments during the year ended December 31, 2018.Additionally, we are subject to performance guarantee requirements under certain client arrangements that were assumed by the Buyer. Should the Divested Business fail to perform as required by the terms of the arrangements, we would be required to fulfill the remaining contract terms, which expire on various dates through 2023. As of December 31, 2018, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the performance guarantees were $188 million, with an estimated fair value of $1 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the performance guarantees during the year ended December 31, 2018.Letters of Credit and Other GuaranteesWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit (“LOCs”). We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $83 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $96 million at December 31, 2017. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.40The Company has certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $103 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $95 million at December 31, 2017.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsApart from commitments, guarantees, and contingencies, as disclosed herein and Note 17 “Claims, Lawsuits, and Other Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability, and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” below.Contractual ObligationsSummarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018. Payments by year due are estimated as follows (in millions): Payments due by 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 After 2023 TotalPrincipal payments on debt$251 $1,000 $— $5,095 $6,346Interest payments on debt275 514 467 2,220 3,476Operating leases303 474 330 472 1,579Pension and other postretirement benefit plans150 270 298 314 1,032Purchase obligations179 132 24 5 340Total$1,158 $2,390 $1,119 $8,106 $12,773Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and other regulations, as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions.In 2017, our principal U.K. subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the U.K. plans to contribute £44 million ($59 million at December 31, 2017 exchange rates) through 2019 which is estimated to bring the plan to 100% funded basis. Contributions were based on the 2016 valuation and no further contributions are forecasted after 2019. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated winding-up deficit was £84 million ($106 million at December 31, 2018 exchange rates). The trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the winding-up deficit be paid.Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts. Purchase obligations exclude $279 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when potential cash settlements will be made.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESOur Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning restructuring, revenue recognition, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Financial Statements.41Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements where control is transferred over time, an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values.Costs incurred by the Company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs, are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.Commercial Risk Solutions includes retail brokerage, cyber solutions, global risk consulting, and captives. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy, or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units transferred and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Reinsurance Solutions includes treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage and capital markets. Revenue primarily includes reinsurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the inception of the reinsurance period for certain reinsurance brokerage, or more commonly, over the term of the arrangement in installments based on deposit or minimum premiums for most treaty reinsurance arrangements.Retirement Solutions includes core retirement, investment consulting, and talent, rewards & performance. Revenue consists primarily of fees paid by customers for consulting services, such as risk management strategies, health and benefits, and human capital consulting services. Revenue recognized for these arrangements is predominantly recognized over the term of the arrangement using input or output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services, or for certain arrangements, at a point in time upon completion of the services. For consulting arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed. Fees paid by customers for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time incurred, days elapsed, or reports delivered. Revenue from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed using input or output measures to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including hours worked, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time and materials incurred. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenue. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.Health Solutions includes health and benefits brokerage and health care exchanges. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. For brokerage commissions, revenue is predominantly recognized at the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services using input or output measures, including units delivered or time elapsed, to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue from health care exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants, net of a reserve for estimated cancellations. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.42Data & Analytic Services includes Affinity, Aon InPoint, and ReView. Revenue consists primarily of fees for services rendered and is generally recognized over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments. For Data & Analytic Services arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation, including units delivered or time elapsed. Input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed.RestructuringWorkforce reduction costsThe method used to account for workforce reduction costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan or are one-time costs. We account for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy, statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula. We recognize these costs when the likelihood of future settlement is probable and the amount of the related benefit is reasonably estimable, or on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period, if applicable.We estimate our one-time workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated. We recognize these costs when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated, notify the employees who might be included in the termination, and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period. When employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period.Lease consolidation costsWhere we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it, we recognize a loss. The loss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we provide notice of cancellation in accordance with contractual terms, vacate the property, or sign a sublease arrangement. To determine the loss, we estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties. When we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee, we adjust our sublease losses for actual outcomes.Fair value concepts of one-time workforce reduction costs and lease lossesAccounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability. Where material, we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value. Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. For the remaining lease term, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount, if material. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded.Asset impairmentsAsset impairments relate to fixed assets and are accounted for in the period when they become known. Furthermore, we record impairments by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows (in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream) or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life. Asset impairments are included in Depreciation of fixed assets in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other associated costs of exit and disposal activitiesWe recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred, including separation costs, moving costs and consulting and legal fees.PensionsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada, which are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted. The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in Compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in Other income (expense). We used a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost 43components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans; this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.Recognition of gains and losses and prior service Certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost. Unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.As of December 31, 2018, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.The following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2019 amortization of loss by country (millions, except amortization period): U.K. U.S. OtherUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses$1,136 $1,708 $433Amortization period8 - 28 7 - 23 13 - 40Estimated 2019 amortization of loss$30 $55 $12The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2018 was $3 million, $30 million, and $(7) million for the U.S., U.K. and other plans, respectively.For the U.S. pension plans, we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2018, the market-related value of assets was $2.0 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of plan assets was $1.8 billion.Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocationThe following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of December 31, 2018: U.K. U.S. OtherExpected return3.64% 7.05% 2.50 - 4.10%In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment-community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.44The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and other non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and other non-U.S. categories, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Target allocations are subject to change.Impact of changing economic assumptionsChanges in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 basis point (“bps”) increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 (in millions):Increase (decrease) in projected benefit obligation (1)25 bps Change in Discount RateIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(158) $168U.S. plans(80) 84Other plans(70) 79(1)Increases to the projected benefit obligation reflect increases to our pension obligations, while decreases in the projected benefit obligation are recoveries toward fully-funded status. A change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the projected benefit obligation.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2019 pension expense (in millions): 25 bps Change in Discount RateIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(2) $1U.S. plans1 (1)Other plans(1) 1Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our long-term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2019 pension expense (in millions): 25 bps Change in Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(13) $13U.S. plans(5) 5Other plans(2) 2Estimated future contributionsWe estimate cash contributions of approximately $145 million to our pension plans in 2019 as compared with cash contributions of $252 million in 2018, which includes our acceleration of contributions to the qualified U.S. pension plan.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames, customer-related and contract-based, or technology and other.Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. No events occurred during 2018 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill.45We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components are a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two-step analysis. Step 1 requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step 2. Step 2 uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in Step 1 and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value.In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. Based on tests performed in both 2018 and 2017, there was no indication of goodwill impairment, and no further testing was required.We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2018. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.ContingenciesWe define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection.Share-Based PaymentsShare-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Restricted Share UnitsRestricted share units (“RSUs”) are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.46Performance Share AwardsPerformance share awards (“PSAs”) are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.The largest plan is the Leadership Performance Plan (“LPP”), which has a three-year performance period. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense. The 2016 to 2018 performance period ended on December 31, 2018, the 2015 to 2017 performance period ended on December 31, 2017 and the 2014 to 2016 performance period ended on December 31, 2016. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2017 to 2019 and 2018 to 2020. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2018 expense by approximately $2.1 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $6.0 million. Income TaxesWe earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In this assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination. We base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was enacted into law and the new legislation contained several key tax provisions that impacted the Company. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“SAB 118”), which allowed registrants to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Reform Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation was expected, certain items were considered provisional in the Company’s financial statements for 2017 due to the forthcoming guidance and ongoing analysis of year-end data and tax positions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its analysis in accordance with SAB 118. See Note 11 “Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information and a detailed description of the impact of completing the accounting for 2017.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if determinable.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.47The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.Foreign Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign exchange rate risk. Our primary exposures include exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Indian rupee, and the Japanese yen. We use over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements.Additionally, some of our non-U.S. brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in U.S. dollars, euros, and Japanese yen, but most of their expenses are incurred in British pounds. At December 31, 2018, we have hedged approximately 45% of our U.K. subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the U.S. dollar, euro, and Japanese yen transactions for the years ending December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively. We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years.We also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures, such as inter-company notes and short-term assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency and are subject to remeasurement.The potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would be $21 million and $5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.Effective July 1, 2018, Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy and therefore the functional currency for our Argentina subsidiaries became the U.S. dollar. As a result, the impact of Argentine peso currency fluctuations in these subsidiaries is reported within the Consolidated Statements of Income prospectively. We are undergoing steps to limit this exposure and the impact to 2018 was insignificant. Revenue from our Argentine operations was less than 1% of our consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.Interest Rate RiskOur fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates, and as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the North America, continental Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $42 million to each of 2019 and 2020 pretax income. A corresponding increase in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase, net of derivative positions, of $42 million to each of 2019 and 2020 pre-tax income.We have long-term debt outstanding with a fair market value of $6.2 billion at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. This fair value was greater than the carrying value by $166 million at December 31, 2018, and $600 million greater than the carrying value at December 31, 2017. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 7% or an increase of 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2018.We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events.48",2023-12-30 20:32:51.825637
315293,AON,Aon plc,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTSAon is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions underpinned by proprietary data and analytics. Management continues to lead its set of initiatives designed to strengthen Aon and unite the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by proprietary data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.Financial Results In the first quarter of 2019, Aon adopted new accounting guidance related to the treatment of leases that was applied using the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, prior periods were not restated. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information surrounding the quantitative and qualitative impacts of adopting the new accounting guidance.The following is a summary of our 2019 financial results from continuing operations:•Revenue increased $243 million, or 2%, to $11,013 million in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting 6% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 3% unfavorable impact if we were to translate prior year period results using current period foreign exchange rates (“foreign currency translation”) and a 1% unfavorable impact from divestitures, net of acquisitions. Organic revenue growth for the year was highlighted by each of the five solution lines contributing similar or improved growth compared to the prior year.•Operating expenses decreased $382 million, or 4%, to $8,844 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a $238 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, a $176 million decrease from a non-cash impairment charge related to certain assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale in the prior year period, $169 million of incremental savings from restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives, an $81 million decrease in expenses related to divestitures, net of acquisitions, a $62 million net decrease in expense related to legacy litigation, and a $34 million decrease in restructuring charges, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth and investments supporting long-term growth initiatives.•Operating margin increased to 19.7% in 2019 from 14.3% in 2018. The increase in operating margin from the prior year is primarily driven by organic revenue growth of 6% and strong operational improvement.•Due to the factors set forth above, net income from continuing operations was $1,574 million in 2019, an increase of $474 million, or 43%, from 2018. •Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $6.37 per share during the twelve months of 2019 compared to $4.29 per share for the prior year period.•Cash flows provided by operating activities was $1,835 million in 2019, an increase of $149 million, or 9%, from $1,686 million in 2018. The current year period includes approximately $130 million of net cash payments related to certain litigation settlements. The prior year comparable period included an $80 million accelerated pension contribution.We focus on four key non-GAAP metrics that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margins, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flows. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics from continuing operations for 2019:•Organic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 6% in 2019, compared to 5% organic growth in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was driven by growth across every major revenue line, with particular strength in Reinsurance Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions.•Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 27.5% in 2019, compared to 25.0% in the prior year. The increase in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects organic revenue growth of 6%, operational improvement, and $169 million of incremental savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.26•Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $9.17 per share in 2019, an increase of $1.01 per share, or 12%, from $8.16 per share in 2018. The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share primarily reflects strong operational performance and effective capital management, highlighted by $2.0 billion of share repurchase during 2019, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.•Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $1,610 million in 2019, an increase of $164 million, or 11%, from $1,446 million in 2018, driven by an increase of $149 million in cash flows in operations and a $15 million decrease in capital expenditures.PROPOSED REORGANIZATIONIn October 2019, we announced the proposed Reorganization, which would result in an Irish public limited company serving as our new publicly traded parent company by means of a scheme of arrangement under English law. The Reorganization would effectively change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the publicly traded parent company of Aon from the U.K. to Ireland. The Reorganization requires shareholder approval, which was obtained on February 4, 2020. We are also required to make an application to the High Court of Justice of England and Wales to seek approval of the Reorganization. This application is expected to be heard, and we currently anticipate that the Reorganization will be completed, on March 31, 2020. This expected date depends on a number of factors. If this expected date is changed, we will give adequate notice of such change by issuing an announcement that will be made available at our website. Upon completion of the Reorganization, each shareholder will own the same number of Class A Ordinary Shares of the new Irish parent company that such shareholder owned immediately prior to completion of the Reorganization, and each shareholder’s proportionate ownership and relative voting rights will remain unchanged. We will continue to report earnings and other financial statements in accordance with SEC regulations, including U.S. dollar denominated financial statements. We expect that the shares of the new Irish parent company will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol “AON,” the same symbol under which our Class A Ordinary Shares are currently listed.We believe the Reorganization will have no material impact on the day-to-day conduct of the various operating companies within Aon, the strategy of Aon, or the dividend policy of the new Irish parent company. The location of our future operations will depend on the needs of our business, independent of legal domicile, as per our practice prior to the Reorganization.27REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTSSummary of ResultsIn the first quarter of 2019, Aon adopted new accounting guidance related to the treatment of leases that was applied using the prospective approach. Under this approach, prior periods were not restated. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information surrounding the quantitative and qualitative impacts of adopting the new accounting guidance. In the first quarter of 2018, Aon adopted new accounting guidance related to the treatment of revenue from contracts with customers that was applied prospectively on the U.S. GAAP financial statements and therefore the 2017 comparable period has not been restated. Our consolidated results are as follow: Years ended December 31(millions) 2019 2018 2017Revenue Total revenue $11,013 $10,770 $9,998Expenses Compensation and benefits 6,054 6,103 6,003Information technology 494 484 419Premises 339 370 348Depreciation of fixed assets 172 176 187Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 392 593 704Other general expense 1,393 1,500 1,272Total operating expenses 8,844 9,226 8,933Operating income 2,169 1,544 1,065Interest income 8 5 27Interest expense (307) (278) (282)Other income (expense) 1 (25) (125)Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,871 1,246 685Income tax expense 297 146 250Net income from continuing operations 1,574 1,100 435Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (1) 74 828Net income 1,573 1,174 1,263Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 41 40 37Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,532 $1,134 $1,226Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $6.37 $4.29 $1.53Discontinued operations — 0.30 3.17Net income $6.37 $4.59 $4.70Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted240.6 247.0 260.7Consolidated Results for 2019 Compared to 2018 RevenueTotal revenue increased $243 million, or 2%, to $11,013 million in 2019, compared to $10,770 million in 2018. The increase was driven by 6% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 1% unfavorable impact from divestitures, net of acquisitions. Organic revenue growth for the year was highlighted by each of the five solution lines contributing similar or improved growth compared to the prior year.Commercial Risk Solutions revenue increased $21 million, or less than 1%, to $4,673 million in 2019, compared to $4,652 million in 2018. Organic revenue growth was 7% in 2019, reflecting growth across every major geography, highlighted by double-28digit growth across the U.S. and Latin America, driven by strong retention and management of the renewal book portfolio. On average globally, exposures and pricing were both modestly positive, resulting in a modestly positive market impact overall.Reinsurance Solutions revenue increased $123 million, or 8%, to $1,686 million in 2019, compared to $1,563 million in 2018. Organic revenue growth was 10% in 2019 driven by strong net new business generation globally in treaty, as well as double-digit growth globally in facultative placements and in capital markets transactions. In addition, market impact was modestly positive on results.Retirement Solutions revenue decreased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,817 million in 2019, compared to $1,865 million in 2018. Organic revenue growth was 2% in 2019 driven by solid growth in delegated investment management and in the Human Capital practice, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from certain businesses that were divested in the second quarter.Health Solutions revenue increased $71 million, or 4%, to $1,667 million in 2019, compared to $1,596 million in 2018. Organic revenue growth was 5% in 2019 driven primarily by solid growth globally in health and benefits brokerage, highlighted by particular strength internationally.Data & Analytic Services revenue increased $79 million, or 7%, to $1,184 million in 2019, compared to $1,105 million in 2018. Organic revenue growth was 4% in 2019 driven by growth globally across our Affinity business, with particular strength across both business and consumer solutions in the U.S.Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits decreased $49 million, or 1%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a $173 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, $144 million of incremental savings from restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives, and a $47 million decrease in expenses related to divestitures, net of acquisitions, partially offset by a $90 million increase in restructuring charges and an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth.Information TechnologyInformation technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, increased $10 million, or 2%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth and an increase in investments to support growth initiatives across the portfolio and enhance capabilities of our Aon Business Services organization, partially offset by a $9 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, an $8 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $5 million decrease in expenses related to divestitures, net of acquisitions, and $4 million of incremental savings from restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.PremisesPremises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, decreased $31 million, or 8%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by an $11 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, $11 million of incremental savings from restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives, and a reduction of costs as we continue to optimize our global real estate footprint, partially offset by a $5 million increase in restructuring charges.Depreciation of Fixed AssetsDepreciation of fixed assets primarily relates to software, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, computer equipment, buildings, and automobiles. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $4 million, or 2%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a $3 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets Amortization and impairment of intangibles primarily relates to finite-lived tradenames and customer-related, contract-based, and technology assets. Amortization and impairment of intangibles decreased $201 million, or 34%, in 2019 compared to 2018. Included in 2018 was a $176 million non-cash impairment charge related to certain assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale.Other General ExpensesOther general expenses decreased $107 million, or 7%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a $122 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $62 million net decrease in expense related to legacy litigation, a $36 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, a $12 million decrease in expenses related to divestitures, net of acquisitions, and $11 million of incremental savings from restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth and investments supporting long-term growth initiatives.29Interest IncomeInterest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $8 million in 2019, an increase of $3 million, or 60%, from 2018, reflecting the currency composition of operating cash.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $307 million in 2019, an increase of $29 million, or 10%, from 2018. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding debt balances.Other Income (Expense)Total other income was $1 million in 2019, compared to other expense of $25 million in 2018. Other income in 2019 primarily includes $13 million in net gains on the disposition of businesses, a $9 million favorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, $9 million of pension and other postretirement income, and $4 million of equity earnings, partially offset by $34 million of losses on certain financial instruments.Income from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDue to factors discussed above, income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1,871 million in 2019, a 50% increase from $1,246 million in 2018. Income Taxes from Continuing OperationsThe effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 15.9% in 2019 and 11.7% in 2018. The primary driver of the 2019 tax rate is the geographical distribution of income, including restructuring charges, as well as net favorable discrete items, including the impact of share-based payments.The 2018 tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income including restructuring charges, legacy litigation, and the impairment of certain assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. The tax rate was also impacted by certain discrete items including the net tax benefit associated with the sale of the disposal group and the impact of share-based payments offset by the net tax expense from enactment date impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and changes in valuation allowances.Net Income from Discontinued OperationsNet loss from discontinued operations was $1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to net income from discontinued operations of $74 million in 2018.Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income attributable to Aon shareholders increased to $1,532 million, or $6.37 per diluted share, in 2019, compared to $1,134 million, or $4.59 per diluted share, in 2018.Consolidated Results for 2018 Compared to 2017We have elected not to include a discussion of our consolidated results for 2018 compared to 2017 in this report in reliance upon Instruction 1 to Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K. This discussion can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019.Non-GAAP MetricsIn our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.30Organic Revenue GrowthWe use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Twelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 % Change Revenue Recognition(1) Less: Currency Impact(2) Less: Fiduciary Investment Income(3) Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other Organic Revenue Growth(4)Commercial Risk Solutions $4,673 $4,652 — % N/A (3)% —% (4)% 7%Reinsurance Solutions 1,686 1,563 8 N/A (2) 1 (1) 10Retirement Solutions 1,817 1,865 (3) N/A (2) — (3) 2Health Solutions 1,667 1,596 4 N/A (3) — 2 5Data & Analytic Services 1,184 1,105 7 N/A (3) — 6 4Elimination (14) (11) N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/ATotal revenue $11,013 $10,770 2 % —% (3)% —% (1)% 6% Twelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 % Change Revenue Recognition(1) Less: Currency Impact(2) Less: Fiduciary Investment Income(3) Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other Organic Revenue Growth(4)Commercial Risk Solutions $4,652 $4,169 12 % — % 1% —% 5 % 6%Reinsurance Solutions 1,563 1,429 9 (1) 2 1 — 7Retirement Solutions 1,865 1,755 6 — 1 — 3 2Health Solutions 1,596 1,515 5 (1) — — 1 5Data & Analytic Services 1,105 1,140 (3) — — — (6) 3Elimination (11) (10) NA NA NA NA NA NATotal revenue $10,770 $9,998 8 % — % 1% —% 2 % 5%(1)Revenue recognition represents the impact of Aon’s adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, effective for Aon in the first quarter of 2018.(2)Currency impact is determined by translating prior period's revenue at this period's foreign exchange rates.(3)Fiduciary investment income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, was $74 million, $53 million, and $32 million.

Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported operating margins is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Years ended December 31 2019 2018 2017Revenue from continuing operations $11,013 $10,770 $9,998 Operating income from continuing operations $2,169 $1,544 $1,065Restructuring 451 485 497Amortization and impairment of intangible assets (1) 392 593 704Legacy litigation (2) 13 75 —Regulatory and compliance matters — — 28Operating income from continuing operations - as adjusted $3,025 $2,697 $2,294 Operating margin from continuing operations 19.7% 14.3% 10.7%Operating margin from continuing operations - as adjusted 27.5% 25.0% 22.9%(1)Included in the twelve months ended December 30, 2018 was a $176 million non-cash impairment charge taken on certain assets and liabilities held for sale. Included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was a $380 million non-cash impairment charge taken on indefinite-lived tradenames.(2)During the fourth quarter of 2019 we settled legacy litigation that had been reported in a prior year as an adjustment to GAAP earnings. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a $13 million charge in the quarter, which represents the difference between the amount accrued in the prior year and the final settlement amount of the legacy litigation.Adjusted Diluted Earnings per ShareWe use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the items identified above, along with pension settlements and related income taxes, because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share data and percentages):32 Year Ended December 31, 2019(millions, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations $2,169 $856 $3,025Interest income 8 — 8Interest expense (307) — (307)Other income (expense) (1) 1 — 1Income before income taxes from continuing operations 1,871 856 2,727Income tax expense (2) 297 181 478Net income from continuing operations 1,574 675 2,249Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (3) (1) — (1)Net income 1,573 675 2,248Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 41 — 41Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,532 $675 $2,207 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $6.37 $2.80 $9.17Discontinued operations — — —Net income $6.37 $2.80 $9.17 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 240.6 — 240.6Effective tax rates (3) Continuing operations 15.9% 17.5%Discontinued operations 47.4% 47.4% Year Ended December 31, 2018(millions, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations $1,544 $1,153 $2,697Interest income 5 — 5Interest expense (278) — (278)Other income (expense) (1) (25) 37 12Income before income taxes from continuing operations 1,246 1,190 2,436Income tax expense (2) 146 233 379Net income from continuing operations 1,100 957 2,057Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (3) 74 (82) (8)Net income 1,174 875 2,049Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 40 — 40Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,134 $875 $2,009 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $4.29 $3.87 $8.16Discontinued operations 0.30 (0.33) (0.03)Net income $4.59 $3.54 $8.13 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 247.0 — 247.0Effective tax rates (3) Continuing operations 11.7% 15.6%Discontinued operations 15,949.3% 29.7%33 Year Ended December 31, 2017(millions, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations $1,065 $1,229 $2,294Interest income 27 — 27Interest expense (282) — (282)Other income (expense) (1) (125) 128 3Income before income taxes from continuing operations 685 1,357 2,042Income tax expense (2) 250 55 305Net income from continuing operations 435 1,302 1,737Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (3) 828 (772) 56Net income 1,263 530 1,793Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 37 — 37Net income attributable to Aon shareholders $1,226 $530 $1,756 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Aon shareholders Continuing operations $1.53 $4.99 $6.52Discontinued operations 3.17 (2.95) 0.22Net income $4.70 $2.04 $6.74 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 260.7 — 260.7Effective tax rates (3) Continuing operations 36.5% 14.9%Discontinued operations 58.9% 11.7%(1)Adjusted Other income (expense) excludes pension settlement charges of $37 million and $128 million, for the years ended 2018, and 2017, respectively.(2)Adjusted items are generally taxed at the estimated annual effective tax rate, except for the applicable tax impact associated with estimated Restructuring Plan expenses, legacy litigation, accelerated tradename amortization, impairment charges and non-cash pension settlement charges, which are adjusted at the related jurisdictional rates. In addition, tax expense excludes the tax impacts of the sale of the disposal group and enactment date impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. (3)Adjusted Net income (loss) from discontinued operations excludes the gain on sale of discontinued operations of $82 million and $779 million for the years ended 2018, and 2017, respectively. Adjusted net income from discontinued operations excludes intangible asset amortization of $11 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate was further adjusted for the applicable tax impact associated with the gain on sale and intangible asset amortization, as applicable.Free Cash FlowWe use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions):Years Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017Cash provided by continuing operating activities $1,835 $1,686 $669Capital expenditures used for continuing operations (225) (240) (183)Free cash flow provided by continuing operations $1,610 $1,446 $486Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate FluctuationsBecause we conduct business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial 34results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the prior year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates. Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a $0.19 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2019. Currency fluctuations had a $0.08 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2018, when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates. Currency fluctuations had a $0.12 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2017, when 2016 results were translated at 2017 rates. Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a $0.23 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2019. Currency fluctuations had a $0.09 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2018, when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates. Currency fluctuations had a $0.08 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2017, when 2016 results were translated at 2017 rates. These translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityExecutive SummaryWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operations, available cash reserves, and debt capacity available under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments, restructuring activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, and shareholder dividends. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future.Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums and claims in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities. In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. Our Fiduciary assets included cash and short-term investments of $5.2 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and fiduciary receivables of $6.7 billion and $6.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes.We maintain multi-currency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2019, non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities were negative; however, the overall balance was positive.The following table summarizes our Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, and Fiduciary assets as of December 31, 2019 (in millions): Statement of Financial Position Classification Asset TypeCash and CashEquivalents Short-TermInvestments FiduciaryAssets TotalCertificates of deposit, bank deposits or time deposits$790 $— $3,285 $4,075Money market funds— 138 1,869 2,007Cash and short-term investments790 138 5,154 6,082Fiduciary receivables— — 6,680 6,680Total$790 $138 $11,834 $12,76235Cash and cash equivalents increased $134 million in 2019 compared to 2018. A summary of our cash flows provided by and used for continuing operations from operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017Cash provided by operating activities $1,835 $1,686 $669Cash provided by (used for) investing activities $(229) $31 $2,806Cash used for financing activities $(1,493) $(1,699) $(3,265)Effect of exchange rates changes on cash and cash equivalents $21 $(118) $69Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased $149 million, or 9%, from the prior year to $1,835 million. This amount represents net income reported, as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, amortization and impairments, and other non-cash income and expenses, as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the collection of receivables.Pension ContributionsPension contributions were $135 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $252 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. In 2020, we expect to contribute approximately $123 million in cash to our pension plans, including contributions to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates.Restructuring PlanIn 2017, Aon initiated the Restructuring Plan in connection with the sale of the Divested Business. The Restructuring Plan was intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency, insight, and connectivity. The Company has incurred all remaining costs for the Restructuring Plan and the plan was closed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Restructuring Plan resulted in cumulative charges of $1,433 million, consisting of $619 million in workforce reduction, $119 million in technology rationalization costs, $69 million in lease consolidation costs, $53 million in non-cash asset impairments, and $573 million in other costs, including certain separation costs associated with the sale of the Divested Business. These charges are included in Compensation and benefits, Information technology, Premises, Depreciation of fixed assets, and Other general expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Before any potential reinvestment of savings, the Restructuring Plan delivered annual cumulative expense savings of $529 million in 2019 and is expected to deliver run-rate savings of $580 million annually in 2020. The Company eliminated 5,832 positions under the Restructuring Plan.The following table summarizes restructuring and separation costs by type that were incurred through the end of the Restructuring Plan (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Completed Plan TotalWorkforce reduction $205 $115 $299 $619Technology rationalization (1) 39 47 33 119Lease consolidation (1) 33 28 8 69Asset impairments 14 13 26 53Other costs associated with restructuring and separation (1) (2) 160 282 131 573Total restructuring and related expenses $451 $485 $497 $1,433(1)Total contract termination costs incurred under the Restructuring Plan associated with technology rationalizations, lease consolidations, and other costs associated with restructuring and separation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $0 million, $33 million, and $13 million, respectively; for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were $5 million, $25 million, and $85 million, respectively; and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $1 million, $8 million, and $3 million, respectively.(2)Other costs associated with the Restructuring Plan include those to separate the Divested Business, as well as moving costs, and consulting and legal fees. These costs are typically recognized when incurred.36The changes in the Company’s liabilities for the Restructuring Plan as of December 31, 2019 are as follows (in millions): Restructuring PlanBalance at December 31, 2018 $201Expensed 418Cash payments (415)Foreign currency translation and other —Balance at December 31, 2019 $204The Company’s unpaid liabilities for the Restructuring Plan are included in both Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Of the remaining liabilities as of December 31, 2019, we expect approximately $180 million to be paid in 2020.Investing ActivitiesCash flows used for investing activities in continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $229 million, a decrease of $260 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for investing activities are acquisition of businesses, purchases of short-term investments, capital expenditures, and payments for investments. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows provided by investing activities are sales of businesses, sales of short-term investments, and proceeds from investments. The gains and losses corresponding to cash flows provided by proceeds from investments and used for payments for investments are primarily recognized in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Short-term InvestmentsShort-term investments decreased $34 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. As disclosed in Note 16 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.Acquisitions and Dispositions of BusinessesDuring 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of three businesses for consideration of $39 million, net of cash acquired, and the disposition of eight businesses for a $52 million cash inflow, net of cash sold.During 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of eight businesses for consideration of $58 million, net of cash acquired, and the disposition of four businesses for a $10 million cash outflow, net of cash sold.Capital ExpendituresThe Company’s additions to fixed assets, including capitalized software, which amounted to $225 million in 2019 and $240 million in 2018, primarily related to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, and software development costs. Financing ActivitiesCash flows used for financing activities in continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $1,493 million, a decrease of $206 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for financing activities are share repurchases, issuances of debt, net of repayments, dividends paid to shareholders, issuances of shares for employee benefit plans, transactions with noncontrolling interests, and other financing activities, such as collection of or payments for deferred consideration in connection with prior-year business acquisitions and divestitures.Share Repurchase ProgramAon has a share repurchase program authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014 and June 2017, for a total of $15.0 billion in repurchase authorizations.37The following table summarizes the Company’s Share Repurchase activity (in millions, except per share data): Twelve months ended December 31 2019 2018Shares repurchased 10.5 10.0Average price per share $186.33 $143.94Costs recorded to retained earnings Total repurchase cost $1,950 $1,447Additional associated costs 10 7Total costs recorded to retained earnings $1,960 $1,454At December 31, 2019, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the Repurchase Program was approximately $2.0 billion. Under the Repurchase Program, we have repurchased a total of 128.7 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $13.0 billion.BorrowingsTotal debt at December 31, 2019 was $7.3 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion compared to December 31, 2018. Commercial paper activity during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows (in millions): Twelve months ended December 31 2019 2018Total issuances(1)$4,812 $5,400Total repayments(4,941) (5,118)Net issuances$(129) $282(1) The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for short-term working capital needs.On November 15, 2019, Aon Corporation issued $500 million 2.20% Senior Notes due November 2022. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down a portion of outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.In September 2019, the Company’s $600 million 5.00% Senior Notes due September 2020 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year.On May 2, 2019, Aon Corporation issued $750 million 3.75% Senior Notes due May 2029. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down a portion of outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.On December 3, 2018, Aon Corporation issued $350 million 4.50% Senior Notes due December 2028. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down a portion of outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Other Liquidity MattersDistributable ReservesAs a company incorporated in England and Wales, we are required under U.K. law to have available “Distributable Reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable Reserves are created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company and, among other methods, through a reduction in share capital approved by the High Court of Justice in England. Distributable Reserves are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had Distributable Reserves in excess of $32.4 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. On July 16, 2019, we completed a reduction in share capital to create additional Distributable Reserves of $31 billion to support the payment of possible future dividends or future share repurchases, if and to the extent declared by the directors in compliance with their duties under U.K. law. We believe that we will have sufficient Distributable Reserves to fund shareholder dividends and make share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Additionally, following the Reorganization, we would be required under Irish law to have available “Distributable Profits” (the equivalent to Distributable Reserves under U.K. law) to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. 38Credit FacilitiesWe expect cash generated by operations for 2019 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, continue purchases of shares under the Repurchase Program, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.As of December 31, 2019, we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: our $900 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in February 2022 and our $400 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2023. Each of these facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, in each case, tested quarterly. At December 31, 2019, we did not have borrowings under either facility, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Shelf Registration StatementOn September 25, 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, Class A Ordinary Shares, and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.Rating Agency RatingsThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at February 14, 2020 appear in the table below. Ratings Senior Long-term Debt Commercial Paper OutlookStandard & Poor’sA- A-2 StableMoody’s Investor ServicesBaa2 P-2 StableFitch, Inc.BBB+ F-2 StableA downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to debt capital, reduce our financial flexibility, or restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether, and/or impact future pension contribution requirements.Guarantees in Connection with the Sale of the Divested BusinessIn connection with the sale of the Divested Business, we guaranteed future operating lease commitments related to certain facilities assumed by the Buyer. We are obligated to perform under the guarantees if the Divested Business defaults on the leases at any time during the remainder of the lease agreements, which expire on various dates through 2025. As of December 31, 2019, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the lease guarantee were $70 million, with an estimated fair value of $12 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the lease commitments during the year ended December 31, 2019.Additionally, we are subject to performance guarantee requirements under certain client arrangements that were assumed by the Buyer. Should the Divested Business fail to perform as required by the terms of the arrangements, we would be required to fulfill the remaining contract terms, which expire on various dates through 2023. As of December 31, 2019, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the performance guarantees were $151 million, with an estimated fair value of $1 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the performance guarantees during the year ended December 31, 2019.Letters of Credit and Other GuaranteesWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit (“LOC”). We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $73 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $83 million at December 31, 2018. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.39We have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $110 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $103 million at December 31, 2018.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsApart from commitments, guarantees, and contingencies, as disclosed herein and Note 17 “Claims, Lawsuits, and Other Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability, and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item I of this report.Contractual ObligationsSummarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019. Payments by year due are estimated as follows (in millions): Payments due by 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 After 2024 TotalPrincipal payments on debt$712 $900 $950 $4,882 $7,444Interest payments on debt302 528 498 2,137 3,465Operating leases208 379 254 432 1,273Pension and other postretirement benefit plans128 288 246 265 927Purchase obligations156 129 63 48 396Total$1,506 $2,224 $2,011 $7,764 $13,505Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and other regulations, as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions.In 2019, our principal U.K. subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the U.K. plans to contribute £1.2 million ($2 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) per annum to facilitate de-risking. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated winding-up deficit was £64 million ($83 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates). The trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the winding-up deficit be paid.Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts. Purchase obligations exclude $299 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to our inability to reasonably estimate the periods when potential cash settlements will be made.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, restructuring, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.40Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements where control is transferred over time, an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values.Costs incurred by the Company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs, are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.Commercial Risk Solutions includes retail brokerage, cyber solutions, global risk consulting, and captives. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units transferred and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Reinsurance Solutions includes treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage and capital markets. Revenue primarily includes reinsurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the inception of the reinsurance period for certain reinsurance brokerage, or more commonly, over the term of the arrangement in installments based on deposit or minimum premiums for most treaty reinsurance arrangements.Retirement Solutions includes core retirement, investment consulting, and human capital. Revenue consists primarily of fees paid by customers for consulting services. Revenue recognized for these arrangements is predominantly recognized over the term of the arrangement using input or output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services, or for certain arrangements, at a point in time upon completion of the services. For consulting arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed. Fees paid by customers for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time incurred, days elapsed, or reports delivered. Revenue from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed using input or output measures to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including hours worked, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time and materials incurred. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenue. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.Health Solutions includes health and benefits brokerage and health care exchanges. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. For brokerage commissions, revenue is predominantly recognized at the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services using input or output measures, including units delivered or time elapsed, to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue from health care exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants, net of a reserve for estimated cancellations. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.41Data & Analytic Services includes Affinity, Aon InPoint, and ReView. Revenue consists primarily of fees for services rendered and is generally recognized over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments. For arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation, including units delivered or time elapsed. Input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed.RestructuringWorkforce reduction costsThe method used to account for workforce reduction costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan, which represents the majority of these costs, or are considered one-time costs related to exit and disposal activities, which are less frequent. We account for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy, statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula. We recognize these costs when the likelihood of future settlement is probable and the amount of the related benefit is reasonably estimable, or on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period, if applicable.Although less frequent than costs subject to our established severance policy, when applicable, we estimate our one-time workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated. We recognize these costs when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated, notify the employees who might be included in the termination, and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period. When employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period.Lease consolidation costsIn the first quarter of 2019, Aon adopted new accounting guidance related to the treatment of leases that was applied using the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, prior periods were not restated. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information surrounding the quantitative and qualitative impacts of adopting the new accounting guidance.Where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement, we remove the associated right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and the related lease liability, including any additional termination penalties incurred that were not previously included within the liability. To the extent that the associated ROU assets and lease liabilities are removed, a corresponding gain or loss is recorded. For properties where we plan to permanently cease use of a space and have the intent and ability to sublease the property, we will test the ROU asset for impairment to determine if a loss has occurred. The test for impairment will adjust the book value of the asset based on the net present value of the future cash flows expected from a sublease agreement using current market quotes for similar properties. When we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee, we may record an additional impairment to reflect actual outcomes. For properties where we plan to permanently cease use of a space and have no intention of reoccupying or subleasing the property, the amortization related to the ROU asset will be accelerated and recognized on a straight-line basis from the date that we commit to a plan to abandon the space through the date we permanently exit the property. Additionally, a loss will also be recognized for lease related costs that are not reflected within the lease liability, such as operating expenses, taxes, and insurance that we are obligated to pay to the landlord after we have permanently exited the property.Fair value concepts of one-time workforce reduction costs and lease lossesAccounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability. Where material, we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value. Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. For the remaining lease term, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount, if material. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded.42Asset impairmentsAsset impairments relate to fixed assets and are accounted for in the period when they become known. Furthermore, we record impairments by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows (in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream) or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life. Other associated costs of exit and disposal activitiesWe recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred, including separation costs, moving costs, and consulting and legal fees.PensionsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada, which are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted. The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in Compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in Other income (expense). We used a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans; this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.Recognition of gains and losses and prior service Certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost. Unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.As of December 31, 2019, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.The following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2020 amortization of loss by country (in millions, except amortization period): U.K. U.S. OtherUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses$1,244 $1,763 $454Amortization period8 to 27 years 7 to 23 years 13 to 38 yearsEstimated 2020 amortization of loss$32 $68 $12The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2019 was $1 million, $40 million, and $(6) million for the U.S., U.K. and other plans, respectively.For the U.S. pension plans, we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2019, the market-related value of assets was $2.0 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of plan assets was $2.1 billion. Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.43Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocationThe following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of December 31, 2019: U.K. U.S. OtherExpected return on plan assets, net of administration expenses2.74% 3.30 - 7.04% 2.10 - 3.10%In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and other non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and other non-U.S. categories, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Target allocations are subject to change.Impact of changing economic assumptionsChanges in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 basis point (“bps”) increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2019 (in millions):Increase (decrease) in projected benefit obligation (1)25 bps Change in Discount RateIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(211) $193U.S. plans$(92) $98Other plans$(61) $65(1)Increases to the projected benefit obligation reflect increases to our pension obligations, while decreases in the projected benefit obligation are recoveries toward fully-funded status. A change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the projected benefit obligation.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2020 pension expense (in millions): 25 bps Change in Discount RateIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(2) $—U.S. plans$1 $(1)Other plans$1 $(1)Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our long-term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2020 pension expense (in millions): 25 bps Change in Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncrease DecreaseU.K. plans$(15) $15U.S. plans$(5) $5Other plans$(3) $3Estimated future contributionsWe estimate cash contributions of approximately $123 million to our pension plans in 2020 as compared with cash contributions of $135 million in 2019.44Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames, customer-related and contract-based, or technology and other.Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. No events occurred during 2019 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill.We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components are a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two-step analysis. Step 1 requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step 2. Step 2 uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in Step 1 and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value.In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. Based on tests performed in both 2019 and 2018, there was no indication of goodwill impairment, and no further testing was required.We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2019. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.ContingenciesWe define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection.Share-Based PaymentsShare-based compensation expense is measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.45Restricted Share UnitsRestricted share units (“RSUs”) are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.Performance Share AwardsPerformance share awards (“PSAs”) are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved, which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.The largest plan is the Leadership Performance Plan (“LPP”), which has a three-year performance period. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense. The 2017 to 2019 performance period ended on December 31, 2019, the 2016 to 2018 performance period ended on December 31, 2018, and the 2015 to 2017 performance period ended on December 31, 2017. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2018 to 2020 and 2019 to 2021. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2019 expense by approximately $7.5 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $7.5 million. Income TaxesWe earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset, historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors.We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination. We base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if determinable.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.46The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.Foreign Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign exchange rate risk. Our primary exposures include exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Indian rupee, and the Japanese yen. We use over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements.Additionally, some of our non-U.S. brokerage subsidiaries receive revenue in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in U.S. dollars, euro, and Japanese yen, but most of their expenses are incurred in British pounds. At December 31, 2019, we have hedged approximately 45% of our U.K. subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the U.S. dollar, euro, and Japanese yen transactions for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021. We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years.We also use forward and option contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany notes and current assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency and are subject to remeasurement.The potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would be $23 million and $6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.The translated value of revenues and expenses from our international brokerage operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were to translate prior year results at current year exchange rates, diluted earnings per share would have an unfavorable $0.19 impact during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Further, adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure as defined and reconciled under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share,” would have an unfavorable $0.23 impact during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 if we were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates.Interest Rate RiskOur fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates, and as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in North America, continental Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $50 million to each of 2020 and 2021 pretax income. A corresponding increase in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase, net of derivative positions, of $50 million to each of 2020 and 2021 pre-tax income.We have long-term debt outstanding, excluding the current portion, with a fair market value of $7.4 billion and $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The fair value was greater than the carrying value by $815 million at December 31, 2019, and $166 million greater than the carrying value at December 31, 2018. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 7% or an increase of 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2019.We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events.47",2023-12-30 20:32:19.314695
315293,AON,Aon plc,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTSAon is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions underpinned by proprietary data and analytics. Management continues to lead its set of initiatives designed to strengthen Aon and unite the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by proprietary data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.Financial Results The following is a summary of our 2020 financial results from continuing operations:•Revenue increased $53 million, or 0%, to $11,066 million in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting 1% organic revenue growth, offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from divestitures, net of acquisitions. Organic revenue growth for the year was driven by strength in the core portions of the business, partially offset by a decline in the more discretionary portions.•Operating expenses decreased $559 million, or 6%, to $8,285 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a $451 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $138 million decrease from accelerated amortization related to certain tradenames that were fully amortized in the second quarter, expense discipline in an effort to proactively manage liquidity due to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 and its impact on the Company, including lower travel and entertainment expense, and a $42 million favorable impact from translating prior year period results at current period foreign exchange rates (“foreign currency translation”), partially offset by $123 million of transaction costs related to the pending combination with WTW and a $37 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures.•Operating margin increased to 25.1% in 2020 from 19.7% in 2019. The increase in operating margin from the prior year is primarily driven by organic revenue growth of 1% and a decrease in operating expenses as listed above.•Due to the factors set forth above, net income from continuing operations was $2,017 million in 2020, an increase of $443 million, or 28%, from 2019. •Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $8.45 per share during the twelve months of 2020 compared to $6.37 per share for the prior year period.•Cash flows provided by operating activities was $2,783 million in 2020, an increase of $948 million, or 52%, from $1,835 million in 2019, primarily due to working capital improvements, including improved collections and actions taken to proactively manage liquidity, a $288 million decrease in restructuring cash outlays, and strong operational improvement. The prior year period included approximately $130 million of net cash payments related to legacy litigation.We focus on four key non-GAAP metrics that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth (decline), adjusted operating margins, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flows. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics from continuing operations for 2020:•Organic revenue growth (decline), a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth (Decline),” was 1% in 2020, compared to 6% organic growth in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was driven by strength in the core portions of our business, partially offset by a decline in the more discretionary portions.•Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 28.5% in 2020, compared to 27.5% in the prior year. The increase in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects expense discipline, including lower travel and entertainment expense, increased operating leverage across the portfolio, and 1% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $47 million decrease in fiduciary investment income and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $12 million.30•Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $9.81 per share in 2020, an increase of $0.64 per share, or 7%, from $9.17 per share in 2019. The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share primarily reflects strong operational performance and effective capital management, highlighted by $1.8 billion of share repurchase during 2020, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.•Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $2,642 million in 2020, an increase of $1,032 million, or 64%, from $1,610 million in 2019, driven by an increase of $948 million in cash flows from operations and a $84 million decrease in capital expenditures. The prior year included $75 million of capital expenditures related to the restructuring program.IRELAND REORGANIZATIONFor a description of the Ireland Reorganization, see Part I, Item 1. “Business - Ireland Reorganization” in this report.BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENTOn March 9, 2020, Aon and WTW, entered into a Business Combination Agreement with respect to a combination of the parties. At the effective date of the Combination, WTW shareholders will be entitled to receive 1.08 newly issued Class A ordinary shares of Aon in exchange for each ordinary share of WTW held by such holders. The Combination is subject to Irish Takeover Rules. The Business Combination Agreement contains certain operating covenants relating to the conduct of business of both parties in the interim period until the transaction is completed. These covenants require both parties to operate their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. In addition, these covenants restrict each party from engaging in certain actions unless a party obtains the prior written consent of the other party. These actions relate to, among other things, authorizing or paying dividends above a specified rate; issuing or authorizing for issuance additional securities; salary, benefits or other compensation and employment-related matters; capital management, debt and liquidity matters; engaging in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions; entering into or materially modifying material agreements; entering into material litigation-related settlements; and making other corporate, tax and accounting changes. The parties’ respective shareholders approved the Combination on August 26, 2020. On October 30, 2020, Aon and WTW amended the Business Combination Agreement to provide that, at the effective date of the transaction, there will be 12 members of Aon’s Board of Directors, including one director mutually agreed by the parties.The parties continue to work with regulators, including the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (which, as previously disclosed, has delivered a “Second Request” pursuant to the HSR Act) and the European Commission (which, as previously disclosed, has initiated a Phase II review of the Combination) to obtain the required approvals to close the Combination. Aon expects to close the Combination in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.RECENT DEVELOPMENTSThe outbreak of the coronavirus, COVID-19, was declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic and has continued to spread across the globe, impacting almost all countries, in varying degrees, creating significant public health concerns, and significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate. While countries are in various stages of business and travel restrictions to address the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as related re-openings, these policies have impacted and will continue to impact worldwide economic activity and may continue to adversely affect our business. We continue to closely monitor the situation and our business, liquidity, and capital planning initiatives. We continue to be fully operational and continue to reoccupy certain offices in phases, where deemed appropriate and in compliance with governmental restrictions considering the impact on health and safety of our colleagues, their families, and our clients. For other areas where restrictions remain in place or where we have started to see a resurgence of COVID-19, we are closely monitoring the situation and continuously reevaluating our plan to return to the workplace. We continue to deploy business continuity protocols to facilitate remote working capabilities to ensure the health and safety of our colleagues and to comply with public health and travel guidelines and restrictions. As the situation continues to evolve, and the scale and duration of disruption cannot be predicted, it is not possible to quantify or estimate the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our business. We are focused on navigating these challenges and potential future impacts to our business presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking proactive steps to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs and support a commitment to no layoffs of our colleagues due to COVID-19. Such actions include, but are not limited to, issuing $1 billion of our new 10-year senior unsecured notes on May 12, 2020 and using the proceeds to repay short-term debt and for other corporate purposes, and reducing our discretionary spending, including limiting discretionary spending on mergers and acquisitions. We also temporarily suspended our share buyback program and temporarily reduced compensation for named executive officers, 31directors, and colleagues during the second quarter, as a precautionary measure, focusing on implementing cash and expense discipline measures. After carefully monitoring the situation, we determined it was appropriate, based on macroeconomic conditions and business performance, to resume share buyback during the third quarter. In addition, temporarily reduced salaries for non-executives were restored at the end of the second quarter and withheld salaries, plus 5% of the withheld salary amounts, were repaid in the third quarter. Temporarily reduced salaries for named executive officers and cash compensation reductions for non-executive directors were fully reinstated and the withheld amounts were paid in full during the fourth quarter. While the ultimate public health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our net revenues, earnings, and cash flows, will be adversely impacted, depending on the duration and severity of the downturn, as well as governmental or other regulatory policies and actions that may impact our business or operations. Our revenues can be generalized into two categories: core and more discretionary arrangements. Core revenues tend to be highly-recurring and non-discretionary, where the services are typically regulated, required, or necessary costs of managing the risk of doing business. As expected, in the fourth quarter of 2020 our core revenues did not experience a significant decrease due to the impacts of COVID-19; however, if the economic downturn becomes more severe, we expect that certain services within our core business may be negatively impacted as well. More discretionary revenues tend to include project-related services, where as expected, in the fourth quarter of 2020 we saw an impact from decreases in revenue due to the impacts of COVID-19. The impacts of the pandemic on our business operations and results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 are further described in the section entitled “Review of Consolidated Results” and “Liquidity and Financial Condition” contained in Part II, Item 7 of this report.32REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTSSummary of ResultsOur consolidated results are as follow:Years ended December 31(millions)202020192018Revenue Total revenue$11,066 $11,013 $10,770 Expenses Compensation and benefits5,905 6,054 6,103 Information technology444 494 484 Premises291 339 370 Depreciation of fixed assets167 172 176 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets246 392 593 Other general expense1,232 1,393 1,500 Total operating expenses8,285 8,844 9,226 Operating income2,781 2,169 1,544 Interest income6 8 5 Interest expense(334)(307)(278)Other income (expense)12 1 (25)Income from continuing operations before income taxes2,465 1,871 1,246 Income tax expense448 297 146 Net income from continuing operations2,017 1,574 1,100 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations1 (1)74 Net income2,018 1,573 1,174 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests49 41 40 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,969 $1,532 $1,134 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholdersContinuing operations$8.45 $6.37 $4.29 Discontinued operations— — 0.30 Net income$8.45 $6.37 $4.59 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted233.1 240.6 247.0 Consolidated Results for 2020 Compared to 2019 RevenueTotal revenue increased $53 million, or 0%, to $11,066 million in 2020, compared to $11,013 million in 2019. The increase was driven by 1% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from divestitures, net of acquisitions. Organic revenue growth for the year was driven by strength in the core portions of the business, partially offset by a decline in the more discretionary portions.Commercial Risk Solutions revenue increased $17 million, or less than 1%, to $4,690 million in 2020, compared to $4,673 million in 2019. Organic revenue growth was 3% in 2020, driven by growth across most major geographies, including solid growth in the U.S. and Canada and double-digit growth in Latin America, driven by strong retention and management of the renewal book portfolio, partially offset by a decline in the more discretionary portions of our book globally. On average globally, exposures and pricing were both modestly positive, resulting in a modestly positive market impact overall.Reinsurance Solutions revenue increased $128 million, or 8%, to $1,814 million in 2020, compared to $1,686 million in 2019. Organic revenue growth was 10% in 2020 driven by double-digit growth in treaty and in facultative placements, reflecting continued net new business generation. In addition, market impact was modestly positive on results.33Retirement Solutions revenue decreased $64 million, or 4%, to $1,753 million in 2020, compared to $1,817 million in 2019. Organic revenue decline was 2% in 2020 driven primarily by a decline in Human Capital for rewards and assessment services and a modest decline in the discretionary portions of Retirement and Investments, partially offset by growth in the core portions of Retirement and Investments.Health Solutions revenue decreased $12 million, or 1%, to $1,655 million in 2020, compared to $1,667 million in 2019. Organic revenue decline was 1% in 2020 driven by a decrease primarily related to COVID-19, including a reduction primarily reflecting the annualized impact of lower employment levels and lower renewals, and a decline in the more discretionary portions of the business. Results were further negatively impacted by a one-time adjustment of $16 million related to revenue that was recorded across multiple years and was identified in connection with the implementation of a new system, partially offset by growth internationally.Data & Analytic Services revenue decreased $13 million, or 1%, to $1,171 million in 2020, compared to $1,184 million in 2019. Organic revenue decline was 5% in 2020 driven by a decrease in the travel and events practice globally.Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits decreased $149 million, or 2%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $205 million decrease in restructuring charges and a $26 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a $17 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, and an increase in expense associated with 1% organic revenue growth.Information TechnologyInformation technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, decreased $50 million, or 10%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $39 million decrease in restructuring charges and expense discipline.PremisesPremises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, decreased $48 million, or 14%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $33 million decrease in restructuring charges and a decrease related to reduced office occupancy.Depreciation of Fixed AssetsDepreciation of fixed assets primarily relates to software, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, computer equipment, buildings, and automobiles. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $5 million, or 3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $14 million decrease in restructuring charges.Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets Amortization and impairment of intangibles primarily relates to finite-lived tradenames and customer-related, contract-based, and technology assets. Amortization and impairment of intangibles decreased $146 million, or 37%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $138 million decrease from accelerated amortization related to certain tradenames that were fully amortized in the second quarter.Other General ExpensesOther general expenses decreased $161 million, or 12%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $160 million decrease in restructuring charges and a temporary reduction of certain expenses, primarily travel and entertainment, partially offset by $123 million of transaction costs related to the pending combination with WTW and a $13 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures.Interest IncomeInterest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $6 million in 2020, a decrease of $2 million, or 25%, from 2019, reflecting the currency composition of operating cash.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $334 million in 2020, an increase of $27 million, or 9%, from 2019. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding debt balances.34Other Income (Expense)Total other income was $12 million in 2020, compared to other income of $1 million in 2019. Other income in 2020 primarily includes a $25 million gain on the sale of certain businesses, $13 million of pension and other postretirement income, and $4 million of equity earnings, partially offset by $12 million of losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, $11 million of losses on financial instruments used to economically hedge gains and losses from changes in foreign exchange rates, and $7 million of expense related to the prepayment of $600 million Senior Notes due September 2020. Other income in 2019 primarily includes a $13 million gain on the sale of certain businesses, $9 million of gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, $9 million of pension and other postretirement income, and $4 million of equity earnings, partially offset by $34 million of losses on financial instruments used to economically hedge gains and losses from changes in foreign exchange rates.Income from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDue to factors discussed above, income from continuing operations before income taxes was $2,465 million in 2020, a 32% increase from $1,871 million in 2019. Income Taxes from Continuing OperationsThe effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 18.2% in 2020 and 15.9% in 2019. The primary driver of the 2020 tax rate is the geographical distribution of income, as well as net favorable discrete items including the impact of share-based payments.The 2019 tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income including restructuring charges, as well as net favorable discrete items including the impact of share-based payments.Net Income from Discontinued OperationsNet income from discontinued operations was $1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $1 million in 2019.Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income attributable to Aon shareholders increased to $1,969 million, or $8.45 per diluted share, in 2020, compared to $1,532 million, or $6.37 per diluted share, in 2019.Consolidated Results for 2019 Compared to 2018We have elected not to include a discussion of our consolidated results for 2019 compared to 2018 in this report in reliance upon Instruction 1 to Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K. This discussion can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on February 14, 2020.Non-GAAP MetricsIn our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth (decline), adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.35Organic Revenue Growth (Decline)We use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth (decline) to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth (decline) is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth (decline) represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Twelve Months EndedDec 31, 2020Dec 31, 2019% ChangeLess: Currency Impact(1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income(2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (Decline)(3)Commercial Risk Solutions$4,690 $4,673 — %— %— %(3)%3 %Reinsurance Solutions1,814 1,686 8 — (1)(1)10 Retirement Solutions1,753 1,817 (4)— — (2)(2)Health Solutions1,655 1,667 (1)(2)— 2 (1)Data & Analytic Services1,171 1,184 (1)— — 4 (5)Elimination(17)(14)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$11,066 $11,013 — %— %— %(1)%1 % Twelve Months EndedDec 31, 2019Dec 31, 2018% ChangeLess: Currency Impact(1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income(2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (Decline)(3)Commercial Risk Solutions$4,673 $4,652 — %(3)%— %(4)%7 %Reinsurance Solutions1,686 1,563 8 (2)1 (1)10 Retirement Solutions1,817 1,865 (3)(2)— (3)2 Health Solutions1,667 1,596 4 (3)— 2 5 Data & Analytic Services1,184 1,105 7 (3)— 6 4 Elimination(14)(11)NANANANANATotal revenue$11,013 $10,770 2 %(3)%— %(1)%6 %(1)Currency impact is determined by translating prior period's revenue at this period's foreign exchange rates.(2)Fiduciary investment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $27 million, $74 million, and $53 million, respectively.(3)Organic revenue growth (decline) includes the impact of intercompany activity, changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges.36Adjusted Operating MarginWe use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported operating margins is as follows (in millions, except percentages):Years ended December 31202020192018Revenue from continuing operations$11,066 $11,013 $10,770 Operating income from continuing operations$2,781 $2,169 $1,544 Restructuring— 451 485 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets (1)246 392 593 Legacy litigation (2)— 13 75 Transaction costs (3)123 — — Operating income from continuing operations - as adjusted$3,150 $3,025 $2,697 Operating margin from continuing operations25.1 %19.7 %14.3 %Operating margin from continuing operations - as adjusted28.5 %27.5 %25.0 %(1)Included in the twelve months ended December 30, 2018 was a $176 million non-cash impairment charge taken on certain assets and liabilities held for sale. (2)During the fourth quarter of 2019 we settled legacy litigation that had been reported in a prior year as an adjustment to GAAP earnings. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a $13 million charge in 2019, which represents the difference between the amount accrued in the prior year and the final settlement amount of the legacy litigation.(3)Certain transaction costs associated with the Combination will be incurred prior to the expected completion of the Combination in the first half of 2021. These costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees required to complete the Combination.Adjusted Diluted Earnings per ShareWe use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the items identified above, along with pension settlements and related income taxes, because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.37A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share data and percentages):Year Ended December 31, 2020(millions, except per share data)U.S. GAAPAdjustmentsNon-GAAP AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations$2,781 $369 $3,150 Interest income6 — 6 Interest expense(334)— (334)Other income (expense) (1)12 — 12 Income before income taxes from continuing operations2,465 369 2,834 Income tax expense (2)448 51 499 Net income from continuing operations2,017 318 2,335 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (3)1 — 1 Net income2,018 318 2,336 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests49 — 49 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,969 $318 $2,287 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholdersContinuing operations$8.45 $1.36 $9.81 Discontinued operations— — — Net income$8.45 $1.36 $9.81 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted233.1 — 233.1 Effective tax rates (2)Continuing operations18.2 %17.6 %Discontinued operations24.1 %24.1 %Year Ended December 31, 2019(millions, except per share data)U.S. GAAPAdjustmentsNon-GAAP AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations$2,169 $856 $3,025 Interest income8 — 8 Interest expense(307)— (307)Other income (expense) (1) 1 — 1 Income before income taxes from continuing operations1,871 856 2,727 Income tax expense (2)297 181 478 Net income from continuing operations1,574 675 2,249 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (3)(1)— (1)Net income1,573 675 2,248 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests41 — 41 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,532 $675 $2,207 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Aon shareholdersContinuing operations$6.37 $2.80 $9.17 Discontinued operations— — — Net income$6.37 $2.80 $9.17 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted240.6 — 240.6 Effective tax rates (2)Continuing operations15.9 %17.5 %Discontinued operations47.4 %47.4 %38Year Ended December 31, 2018(millions, except per share data)U.S. GAAPAdjustmentsNon-GAAP AdjustedOperating income from continuing operations$1,544 $1,153 $2,697 Interest income5 — 5 Interest expense(278)— (278)Other income (expense) (1)(25)37 12 Income before income taxes from continuing operations1,246 1,190 2,436 Income tax expense (2)146 233 379 Net income from continuing operations1,100 957 2,057 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (3)74 (82)(8)Net income1,174 875 2,049 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests40 — 40 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,134 $875 $2,009 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Aon shareholdersContinuing operations$4.29 $3.87 $8.16 Discontinued operations0.30 (0.33)(0.03)Net income$4.59 $3.54 $8.13 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted247.0 — 247.0 Effective tax rates (2)Continuing operations11.7 %15.6 %Discontinued operations15,949.3 %29.7 %(1)Adjusted Other income (expense) excludes pension settlement charges of $37 million for the year ended 2018.(2)Adjusted items are generally taxed at the estimated annual effective tax rate, except for the applicable tax impact associated with estimated Restructuring Plan expenses, legacy litigation, transaction costs, accelerated tradename amortization, impairment charges and non-cash pension settlement charges, which are adjusted at the related jurisdictional rates. In addition, tax expense excludes the tax impacts of the sale of the disposal group and enactment date impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. (3)Adjusted Net income (loss) from discontinued operations excludes the gain on sale of discontinued operations of $82 million for the year ended 2018. The effective tax rate was further adjusted for the applicable tax impact associated with the gain on sale and intangible asset amortization, as applicable.Free Cash FlowWe use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions):Years Ended December 31202020192018Cash provided by continuing operating activities$2,783 $1,835 $1,686 Capital expenditures used for continuing operations(141)(225)(240)Free cash flow provided by continuing operations$2,642 $1,610 $1,446 Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate FluctuationsBecause we conduct business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between 39periods by translating the prior year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates. Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a $0.03 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2020. Currency fluctuations had a $0.19 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2019, when 2018 results were translated at 2019 rates. Currency fluctuations had a $0.08 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2018, when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates. Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a $0.04 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2020. Currency fluctuations had a $0.23 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2019, when 2018 results were translated at 2019 rates. Currency fluctuations had a $0.09 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2018, when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates. These translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityExecutive SummaryWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operations, available cash reserves, and debt capacity available under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, shareholder dividends, and restructuring activities. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements over the long-term.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken various proactive steps and continue to evaluate opportunities that will increase our liquidity and strengthen our financial position. Such actions include, but are not limited to, issuing $1 billion of 10-year senior unsecured notes on May 12, 2020 and using the proceeds to repay short-term debt and for other corporate purposes, and reducing our discretionary spending, including limiting discretionary spending on mergers and acquisitions. We also temporarily suspended our share buyback program and temporarily reduced compensation for named executive officers, directors, and colleagues during the second quarter, as a precautionary measure to protect our liquidity, focusing on implementing cash and expense discipline measures. After carefully monitoring the situation, we determined it was appropriate, based on macroeconomic conditions and business performance, to resume share buyback during the third quarter. In addition, temporarily reduced salaries for non-executives were restored at the end of the second quarter and withheld salaries, plus 5% of the withheld salary amounts, were repaid in the third quarter. Temporarily reduced salaries for named executive officers and cash compensation reductions for non-executive directors were fully reinstated and the withheld amounts were paid in full during the fourth quarter.We expect to have the ability to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months and beyond through the use of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, funds available under our credit facilities and commercial paper programs, and cash flows from operations. Short-term investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash, as deemed appropriate. In the second quarter, we issued $1 billion in 2.80% Senior Notes due May 2030, from which a portion of the proceeds were used to repay our $600 million 5.00% senior notes in June 2020, which were scheduled to mature in September 2020. Additionally, in the third quarter, Aon Global Holdings plc established the European Commercial Paper Program for €625 million, subsequently the previous European Commercial Paper Program, established by Aon Global Limited for €525 million, was withdrawn in the quarter, increasing the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the European program by €100 million. In February of 2021 we repaid the $400 million 2.80% Senior Notes that were due to mature in March 2021, which further reduced our debt obligations.We believe our liquidity position at December 31, 2020 remains strong as evidenced by strong cash flows in the quarter and significant cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances. Given the significant uncertainties of economic conditions due to COVID-19, we will continue to closely monitor and actively manage our liquidity as economic conditions change.Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance 40premiums and claims in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities. In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. Our Fiduciary assets included cash and short-term investments of $5.7 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and fiduciary receivables of $8.1 billion and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes.We maintain multi-currency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2020, non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities may have been negative; however, the overall balance was positive.The following table summarizes our Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, and Fiduciary assets as of December 31, 2020 (in millions): Statement of Financial Position Classification Asset TypeCash and CashEquivalentsShort-TermInvestmentsFiduciaryAssetsTotalCertificates of deposit, bank deposits or time deposits$884 $— $3,216 $4,100 Money market funds— 308 2,473 2,781 Cash and short-term investments884 308 5,689 6,881 Fiduciary receivables— — 8,109 8,109 Total$884 $308 $13,798 $14,990 Cash and cash equivalents increased $94 million in 2020 compared to 2019. A summary of our cash flows provided by and used for continuing operations from operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31202020192018Cash provided by operating activities$2,783 $1,835 $1,686 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities$(679)$(229)$31 Cash used for financing activities$(2,088)$(1,493)$(1,699)Effect of exchange rates changes on cash and cash equivalents$78 $21 $(118)Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased $948 million, or 52%, from the prior year to $2,783 million. This amount represents net income reported, as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, amortization and impairments, and other non-cash income and expenses, as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the collection of receivables.Pension ContributionsPension contributions were $120 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $135 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. In 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $122 million in cash to our pension plans, including contributions to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates.Investing ActivitiesCash flows used for investing activities in continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $679 million, an increase of $450 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for 41investing activities are acquisition of businesses, purchases of short-term investments, capital expenditures, and payments for investments. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows provided by investing activities are sales of businesses, sales of short-term investments, and proceeds from investments. The gains and losses corresponding to cash flows provided by proceeds from investments and used for payments for investments are primarily recognized in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Short-term InvestmentsShort-term investments increased $170 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. As disclosed in Note 15 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.Acquisitions and Dispositions of BusinessesDuring 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of six businesses for consideration of $368 million, net of cash acquired, and the disposition of one businesses for a $30 million cash inflow, net of cash sold.During 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of three businesses for consideration of $39 million, net of cash acquired, and the disposition of eight businesses for a $52 million cash inflow, net of cash sold.Capital ExpendituresThe Company’s additions to fixed assets, including capitalized software, which amounted to $141 million in 2020 and $225 million in 2019, primarily related to the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, software development costs, and computer equipment purchases. Financing ActivitiesCash flows used for financing activities in continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $2,088 million, an increase of $595 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for financing activities are share repurchases, issuances of debt, net of repayments, dividends paid to shareholders, issuances of shares for employee benefit plans, transactions with noncontrolling interests, and other financing activities, such as collection of or payments for deferred consideration in connection with prior-year business acquisitions and divestitures.Share Repurchase ProgramWe have a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014, June 2017, and November 2020 for a total of $20.0 billion in repurchase authorizations. Although the Company temporarily suspended its share Repurchase Program in the first half of the year, the Company resumed share buyback during the third quarter based on macroeconomic conditions and business performance.The following table summarizes the Company’s Share Repurchase activity (in millions, except per share data):Twelve months ended December 3120202019Shares repurchased8.5 10.5 Average price per share$206.28 $186.33 Costs recorded to retained earningsTotal repurchase cost$1,761 $1,950 Additional associated costs2 10 Total costs recorded to retained earnings$1,763 $1,960 At December 31, 2020, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the Repurchase Program was approximately $5.3 billion. Under the Repurchase Program, we have repurchased a total of 137.3 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $14.7 billion.42BorrowingsTotal debt at December 31, 2020 was $7.7 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion compared to December 31, 2019. Commercial paper activity during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions):Twelve months ended December 3120202019Total issuances(1)$3,162 $4,812 Total repayments(3,275)(4,941)Net repayments$(113)$(129)(1) The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for short-term working capital needs.On May 29, 2020, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Aon Corporation”), issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of its 5.00% Senior Notes, which were set to mature on September 30, 2020, for the redemption of all $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes. The redemption date was on June 30, 2020 and resulted in a loss of $7 million due to extinguishment.On May 12, 2020, Aon Corporation issued $1 billion 2.80% Senior Notes due May 2030. Aon Corporation used a portion of the net proceeds on June 30, 2020 to repay its outstanding 5.00% Senior Notes, which were set to mature on September 30, 2020. The Company intends to use the remainder to repay other borrowings and for general corporate purposes.On March 2020, the Company’s $400 million 2.80% Senior Notes due March 2021 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year.On November 15, 2019, Aon Corporation issued $500 million 2.20% Senior Notes due November 2022. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down a portion of outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.On May 2, 2019, Aon Corporation issued $750 million 3.75% Senior Notes due May 2029. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down a portion of outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.Subsequent EventsOn January 13, 2021, Aon Global Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales and a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon plc, issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of its 2.80% Senior Notes, which were set to mature in March 2021, for the redemption of all $400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes. The redemption date was on February 16, 2021 and resulted in an insignificant loss due to extinguishment.Other Liquidity MattersDistributable ProfitsThe Company is required under Irish law to have available “distributable profits” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable profits are created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and, among other methods, through intercompany dividends or a reduction in share capital approved by the High Court of Ireland. Distributable profits are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). Following the Ireland Reorganization, we must reestablish distributable profits of the parent entity and will regularly create distributable profits as required to meet our capital needs. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (associated with Aon Global Limited), we had distributable profits in excess of $0.2 billion and $32.4 billion, respectively. We believe that we have the ability to create sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future.Credit FacilitiesWe expect cash generated by operations for 2020 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, continue purchases of shares under the Repurchase Program, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.43As of December 31, 2020, we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: our $900 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in February 2022 and our $750 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2023. Effective February 27, 2020, the $750 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility was increased by $350 million from the original $400 million. In aggregate, these two facilities provide $1.65 billion in available credit. Each of these facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, in each case, tested quarterly. At December 31, 2020, we did not have borrowings under either facility, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Shelf Registration StatementOn May 12, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, Class A Ordinary Shares and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.Rating Agency RatingsThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at February 19, 2021 appear in the table below.Ratings Senior Long-term Debt Commercial Paper OutlookStandard & Poor’sA- A-2 StableMoody’s Investor ServicesBaa2 P-2 StableFitch, Inc.BBB+ F-2 NegativeOn March 11, 2020, Fitch Inc. (“Fitch”) placed our ‘BBB+’ rating on Rating Watch Negative (versus a prior Stable Outlook) following the announcement of the Combination. Negative Watch indicates that our Fitch rating could stay at its present level or potentially be downgraded. In its rating action commentary, Fitch states “rating expectations will unfold after further transaction details emerge and after Fitch evaluates both companies ongoing financial results prior to the projected first half 2021 closing”. We are committed to managing our current investment grade ratings. Any downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt or commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether, or impact future pension contribution requirements.Guarantees in Connection with the Sale of the Divested BusinessIn connection with the sale of the Divested Business, we guaranteed future operating lease commitments related to certain facilities assumed by the Buyer. We are obligated to perform under the guarantees if the Divested Business defaults on the leases at any time during the remainder of the lease agreements, which expire on various dates through 2025. As of December 31, 2020, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the lease guarantee were $55 million, with an estimated fair value of $8 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the lease commitments during the year ended December 31, 2020.Additionally, we are subject to performance guarantee requirements under certain client arrangements that were assumed by the Buyer. Should the Divested Business fail to perform as required by the terms of the arrangements, we would be required to fulfill the remaining contract terms, which expire on various dates through 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the performance guarantees were $104 million, with an estimated fair value of $1 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the performance guarantees during the year ended December 31, 2020.Letters of Credit and Other GuaranteesWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit (“LOC”). We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $79 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $73 million at December 31, 2019. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.44We have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $113 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $110 million at December 31, 2019.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsApart from commitments, guarantees, and contingencies, as disclosed herein and Note 16 “Claims, Lawsuits, and Other Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability, and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this report.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 are comprised of principal payments on debt, interest payments on debt, operating leases, pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and purchase obligations.Operating leases are primarily comprised of leased office space throughout the world. As leases expire, we do not anticipate difficulty in negotiating renewals or finding other satisfactory space if the premise becomes unavailable. In certain circumstances, we may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to third parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved. Refer to Note 9 “Lease Commitments” for further information.Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and other regulations, as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions. Refer to Note 12 “Employee Benefits” for further information.Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts. We had no other cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements where control is transferred over time, an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values.47Costs incurred by the Company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs, are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.Commercial Risk Solutions includes retail brokerage, cyber solutions, global risk consulting, and captives. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units transferred and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Reinsurance Solutions includes treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage and capital markets. Revenue primarily includes reinsurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the inception of the reinsurance period for certain reinsurance brokerage, or more commonly, over the term of the arrangement in installments based on deposit or minimum premiums for most treaty reinsurance arrangements.Retirement Solutions includes core retirement, investment consulting, and human capital. Revenue consists primarily of fees paid by customers for consulting services. Revenue recognized for these arrangements is predominantly recognized over the term of the arrangement using input or output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services, or for certain arrangements, at a point in time upon completion of the services. For consulting arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed. Fees paid by customers for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time incurred, days elapsed, or reports delivered. Revenue from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed using input or output measures to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including hours worked, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time and materials incurred. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.Health Solutions includes health and benefits brokerage and health care exchanges. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. For brokerage commissions, revenue is predominantly recognized at the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services using input or output measures, including units delivered or time elapsed, to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue from health care exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants, net of a reserve for estimated cancellations. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.Data & Analytic Services includes Affinity, Aon Inpoint, CoverWallet, and ReView. Revenue consists primarily of fees for services rendered and is generally recognized over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments. For arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the 48performance obligation, including units delivered or time elapsed. Input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed.PensionsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada, which are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted. The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in Compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in Other income (expense). We used a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans; this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.Recognition of gains and losses and prior service Certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost. Unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.As of December 31, 2020, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.The following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2021 amortization of loss by country (in millions, except amortization period):U.K.U.S.OtherUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses$1,329 $1,812 $514 Amortization period8 to 26 years6 to 24 years13 to 36 yearsEstimated 2021 amortization of loss$34 $78 $14 The U.S. had no unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2020. The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2020 was $43 million, and $(7) million for the U.K. and other plans, respectively.For the U.S. pension plans, we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2020, the market-related value of assets was $2.1 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of plan assets was $2.3 billion. Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.49Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocationThe following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of December 31, 2020:U.K.U.S.OtherExpected return on plan assets, net of administration expenses2.04%2.65 - 6.56%1.70 - 2.65%In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and other non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and other non-U.S. categories, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Target allocations are subject to change.Impact of changing economic assumptionsChanges in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 basis point (“bps”) increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2020 (in millions):Increase (decrease) in projected benefit obligation (1)25 bps Change in Discount RateIncreaseDecreaseU.K. plans$(299)$242 U.S. plans$(100)$105 Other plans$(70)$75 (1)Increases to the projected benefit obligation reflect increases to our pension obligations, while decreases in the projected benefit obligation are recoveries toward fully-funded status. A change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the projected benefit obligation.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2021 pension expense (in millions): 25 bps Change in Discount RateIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncreaseDecreaseU.K. plans$1 $(1)U.S. plans$2 $(2)Other plans$1 $(1)Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our long-term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2021 pension expense (in millions): 25 bps Change in Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncreaseDecreaseU.K. plans$(16)$16 U.S. plans$(5)$5 Other plans$(4)$4 Estimated future contributionsWe estimate cash contributions of approximately $122 million to our pension plans in 2021 as compared with cash contributions of $120 million in 2020.50Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames, customer-related and contract-based, or technology and other.Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components are a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a quantitative analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.ContingenciesWe define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection.Share-Based PaymentsShare-based compensation expense is measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Restricted Share UnitsRestricted share units (“RSUs”) are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.51Performance Share AwardsPerformance share awards (“PSAs”) are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved, which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.The largest plan is the Leadership Performance Plan (“LPP”), which has a three-year performance period. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense. The 2018 to 2020 performance period ended on December 31, 2020, the 2017 to 2019 performance period ended on December 31, 2019, and the 2016 to 2018 performance period ended on December 31, 2018. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2019 to 2021 and 2020 to 2022. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2020 expense by approximately $7.2 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $7.2 million. Income TaxesWe earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset, historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors.We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination. We base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if determinable.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.52Foreign Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign exchange rate risk. Our primary exposures include exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Indian rupee, and the Japanese yen. We use over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements.Additionally, some of our non-U.S. brokerage subsidiaries receive revenue in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in U.S. dollars, euro, and Japanese yen, but most of their expenses are incurred in British pounds. At December 31, 2020, we have hedged approximately 45% of our U.K. subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the U.S. dollar, euro, and Japanese yen transactions for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2022. We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years.We also use forward and option contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany notes and current assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency and are subject to remeasurement.The potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would be $28 million and $14 million at December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.The translated value of revenues and expenses from our international brokerage operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were to translate prior year results at current year exchange rates, diluted earnings per share would have an unfavorable $0.03 impact during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Further, adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure as defined and reconciled under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share,” would have an unfavorable $0.04 impact during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 if we were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates.Interest Rate RiskOur fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates and, as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the U.S. and in continental Europe. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $58 million to each of 2021 and 2022 pretax income. A corresponding increase in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase, net of derivative positions, of $58 million to each of 2021 and 2022 pre-tax income.We have long-term debt outstanding, excluding the current portion, with a fair market value of $8.8 billion and $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The fair value was greater than the carrying value by $1,471 million at December 31, 2020, and $815 million greater than the carrying value at December 31, 2019. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 7% or an increase of 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2020.We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events.53",2023-12-30 20:31:20.067121
315293,AON,Aon plc,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2021 FINANCIAL RESULTSAon plc is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, health, and wealth solutions. Through our experience, global reach, and comprehensive analytics, we are better able to help clients meet rapidly changing, increasingly complex, and interconnected challenges. We are committed to accelerating innovation to address unmet and evolving client needs, so that our clients are better informed, better advised, and able to make better decisions to protect and grow their business. Management is focused on strengthening Aon and uniting the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.Financial ResultsThe following is a summary of our 2021 financial results:•Revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 10%, to $12.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting 9% organic revenue growth and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from divestitures, net of acquisitions.•Operating expenses increased $1.8 billion, or 22%, to $10.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a $1.3 billion increase in charges related to terminating the combination with WTW and related costs, increased expenses associated with 9% organic revenue growth, and a $195 million unfavorable impact from translating prior year period results at current period foreign exchange rates (“foreign currency translation”), partially offset by a $72 million decrease in amortization related to certain tradenames that were fully amortized in the second quarter of 2020 and a $58 million decrease in expenses related to divestitures, net of acquisitions.•Operating margin decreased to 17.1% in 2021 from 25.1% in 2020. The decrease was driven by an increase in operating expenses as listed above, partially offset by organic revenue growth of 9%.•Due to the factors set forth above, Net income was $1.3 billion in 2021, a decrease of $0.7 billion, or 35%, from 2020.•Diluted earnings per share decreased 34% to $5.55 per share during the twelve months of 2021 compared to $8.45 per share for the prior year period.•Cash flows provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion in 2021, a decrease of $0.6 billion, or 22%, from $2.8 billion in 2020, primarily due to the $1 billion termination fee payment and additional payments related to terminating the combination with WTW, partially offset by strong revenue growth.We focus on four key metrics not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for 2021:•Organic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 9% in 2021, compared to 1% organic growth in the prior year.•Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 30.1% in 2021, compared to 28.5% in the prior year. The increase in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects 9% organic revenue growth and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $63 million.•Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $12.00 per share in 2021, an increase of $2.19 per share, or 22%, from $9.81 per share in 2020. The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share primarily reflects strong operational performance and effective capital management, highlighted by $3.5 billion of share repurchase during 2021, and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation.•Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $2.0 billion in 2021, a decrease of $597 million, or 23%, from $2.6 billion in 2020, reflecting a decrease in cash flows from operations, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in capital expenditures.30BUSINESS OVERVIEWIn the third quarter of 2021, we announced a realignment of our principal service lines to the following: Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Health Solutions, and Wealth Solutions. Realignment to these four solution lines results in the following changes in the presentation of our principal service line reporting:•Data & Analytic Services’ revenue and organic revenue results, which were previously reported as a separate principal service line and include Affinity, Aon Inpoint, CoverWallet, and ReView, are included within Commercial Risk Solutions.•Human Capital, which was previously reported within Retirement Solutions, is included within Health Solutions’ revenue and organic revenue results.•Wealth Solutions includes revenue and organic revenue results for all businesses previously reported within Retirement Solutions, excluding Human Capital.The changes in the solution line structure affects only the manner in which our revenue and organic revenue results for our principal service lines were previously reported and have no impact our previously reported Consolidated Financial Statements, results of operations, or total organic revenue growth. We continue to operate as one segment that includes all of our operations. See the “Principal Products and Services” section in Part I, Item 1 of this report for information on each of the four principal service lines.TERMINATION OF BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENTOn March 9, 2020, we and WTW entered into a Business Combination Agreement with respect to a combination of the parties (the “Combination”). The parties’ respective shareholders approved the Combination on August 26, 2020. On June 16, 2021, the DOJ filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against the Company and WTW in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to enjoin the Combination. On July 26, 2021, the Company and WTW mutually agreed to terminate the Business Combination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Business Combination Agreement was terminated and a termination fee of $1 billion (the “Termination Fee”) was paid to WTW. Following the termination, the lawsuit by the DOJ was dismissed.Aon Corporation, a subsidiary of Aon plc, paid the Termination Fee to WTW on July 27, 2021, reflecting that U.S. business services provided by Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries were the primary focus of the DOJ’s challenge to our proposed combination. The Termination Fee was paid to defend the existing U.S. business of Aon Corporation and to avoid additional remedy divestitures of critical Aon Corporation business segments in the U.S. and the continuing delay and uncertainty in completing the combination.COVID-19 PANDEMICThe outbreak of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, was declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic and has impacted almost all countries, in varying degrees, creating significant public health concerns, and significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption in every region in which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and may continue to result, in significant economic disruption and volatility, although in recent months progress has been made in the development and distribution of vaccines, contributing to overall improved economic conditions globally, despite recent developments as a result of the Delta and Omicron variants. We continue to closely monitor the situation and its impacts on our business, liquidity, and capital planning initiatives. We continue to be fully operational and to reoccupy certain offices in phases, where deemed appropriate and in compliance with governmental restrictions considering the impact on health and safety of our colleagues, their families, and our clients, and we have restricted or minimized access to offices where appropriate to support the health and safety of our colleagues. We continue to deploy business continuity protocols to facilitate remote working capabilities to ensure the health and safety of our colleagues and to comply with public health and travel guidelines and restrictions.As the situation continues to evolve, the scale and duration of disruption cannot be predicted, and it is not possible to quantify or estimate the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our business. While we continue to focus on managing our cash flow to meet liquidity needs, our results of operations, particularly with respect to our more discretionary revenues, may be adversely affected. However, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the impacts of COVID-19 on our business results have lessened and we have seen overall strength across the firm. We continue to monitor the situation closely.The impacts of the pandemic on our business operations and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 are further described in the sections entitled “Review of Consolidated Results” and “Liquidity and Financial Condition” contained in Part II, Item 7 of this report.31ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCEFor many companies, the management of ESG risks and opportunities has become increasingly important. Aon offers a wide range of consulting and advisory solutions designed to address and manage ESG issues for clients. We view ESG risks as presenting an important opportunity to help clients and improve our impact on ESG matters.REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTSSummary of ResultsOur consolidated results are as follow (in millions, except per share data):Years Ended December 31202120202019Revenue Total revenue$12,193 $11,066 $11,013 Expenses Compensation and benefits6,738 5,905 6,054 Information technology477 444 494 Premises327 291 339 Depreciation of fixed assets179 167 172 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets147 246 392 Other general expense2,235 1,232 1,393 Total operating expenses10,103 8,285 8,844 Operating income2,090 2,781 2,169 Interest income11 6 8 Interest expense(322)(334)(307)Other income152 13 — Income before income taxes1,931 2,466 1,870 Income tax expense623 448 297 Net income1,308 2,018 1,573 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests53 49 41 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,255 $1,969 $1,532 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$5.55 $8.45 $6.37 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted226.1 233.1 240.6 Consolidated Results for 2021 Compared to 2020RevenueTotal revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 10%, to $12.2 billion in 2021, compared to $11.1 billion in 2020. The increase was driven by 9% organic revenue growth and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from divestitures, net of acquisitions.Commercial Risk Solutions revenue increased $774 million, or 13%, to $6.6 billion in 2021, compared to $5.9 billion in 2020. Organic revenue growth was 11% in 2021, reflecting growth across every major geography, driven by strong new business generation, retention, and management of the renewal book portfolio. Strength in retail brokerage was highlighted by double-digit growth in the U.S., Latin America, and Asia. Results also reflect growth in the more discretionary portions of the business, including double-digit growth in transaction solutions and project-related work. On average globally, exposures and pricing were both modestly positive, which resulted in a modestly positive market impact overall.Reinsurance Solutions revenue increased $183 million, or 10%, to $2.0 billion in 2021, compared to $1.8 billion in 2020. Organic revenue growth was 8% in 2021 driven by strong net new business generation in treaty, as well as solid growth in facultative placements and double-digit growth in capital markets transactions. In addition, market impact was modestly positive on results.32Health Solutions revenue increased $87 million, or 4%, to $2.2 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020. Organic revenue growth was 10% in 2021 driven by double-digit growth in human capital due to growth in both rewards and assessments solutions. In health and benefits brokerage, solid growth globally in the core was driven by strong retention and management of the renewal book portfolio, as well as growth in the more discretionary portions of the business, including double-digit growth in voluntary benefits and enrollment solutions and project-related work.Wealth Solutions revenue increased $85 million, or 6%, to $1.4 billion in 2021, compared to $1.3 billion in 2020. Organic revenue growth was 2% in 2021 driven by growth in investments, including solid growth in delegated investment management, as well as growth in retirement, primarily from higher utilization rates and project-related work.Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits increased $833 million, or 14%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in expense associated with 9% organic revenue growth, a $245 million increase in charges related to terminating the combination with WTW and related costs, and a $151 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a $17 million decrease in expenses related to divestitures, net of acquisitions.Information TechnologyInformation technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, increased $33 million, or 7%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a $17 million increase in charges related to terminating the combination with WTW and related costs, an increase in expense associated with 9% organic revenue growth, investments in long-term growth, and a $5 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.PremisesPremises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, increased $36 million, or 12%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a $22 million increase in charges related to terminating the combination with WTW and related costs and a $10 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Depreciation of Fixed AssetsDepreciation of fixed assets primarily relates to software, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, computer equipment, buildings, and automobiles. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $12 million, or 7%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a $16 million increase in charges related to terminating the combination with WTW and related costs.Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets Amortization and impairment of intangibles primarily relates to finite-lived tradenames and customer-related, contract-based, and technology assets. Amortization and impairment of intangibles decreased $99 million, or 40%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a $72 million decrease from certain tradenames that were fully amortized in the second quarter of 2020.Other General ExpensesOther general expenses increased $1.0 billion, or 81%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a $1.0 billion increase in charges related to terminating the combination with WTW and related costs, a $21 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, and an increase in expense associated with 9% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $37 million decrease in expenses related to divestitures, net of acquisitions.Interest IncomeInterest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on Funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $11 million in 2021, an increase of $5 million, or 83%, from 2020.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $322 million in 2021, a decrease of $12 million, or 4%, from 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower average outstanding term debt.33Other Income Other income was $152 million in 2021, compared to $13 million in 2020. Other income in 2021 primarily includes $142 million of gains from the disposal of business, compared to $25 million in 2020.Income before Income TaxesDue to factors described above, income before income taxes was $1.9 billion in 2021, a 22% decrease from $2.5 billion in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a $1.0 billion increase in charges related to terminating the combination with WTW and related costs, as previously described.Income Taxes The effective tax rate on net income was 32.3% in 2021 and 18.2% in 2020. The primary drivers of the 2021 tax rate were the impact of the Termination Fee, the U.K. statutory tax rate increase, and the tax benefit of share-based payments. The U.K. enacted legislation in the second quarter of 2021 which increases the corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% with effect from April 1, 2023 and the Company remeasured its U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly.The 2020 tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income, as well as certain discrete items, primarily the favorable impacts of share-based payments and the release of a valuation allowance. Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income attributable to Aon shareholders decreased to $1.3 billion, or $5.55 per diluted share, in 2021, compared to $2.0 billion, or $8.45 per diluted share, in 2020.Consolidated Results for 2020 Compared to 2019We have elected not to include a discussion of our consolidated results for 2020 compared to 2019 in this report in reliance upon Instruction 1 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K. This discussion can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on February 19, 2021.Non-GAAP MetricsIn our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth (decline), adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.34Organic Revenue Growth (Decline)We use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth (decline) to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth (decline) is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth (decline) represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Years EndedDec 31, 2021Dec 31, 2020% ChangeLess: Currency Impact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (3)Commercial Risk Solutions$6,635 $5,861 13 %2 %— %— %11 %Reinsurance Solutions1,997 1,814 10 2 — — 8 Health Solutions2,154 2,067 4 2 — (8)10 Wealth Solutions1,426 1,341 6 3 — 1 2 Elimination(19)(17)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$12,193 $11,066 10 %2 %— %(1)%9 % Years EndedDec 31, 2020Dec 31, 2019% ChangeLess: Currency Impact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (Decline) (3)Commercial Risk Solutions$5,861 $5,857 — %— %— %(1)%1 %Reinsurance Solutions1,814 1,686 8 — (1)(1)10 Health Solutions2,067 2,104 (2)(1)— 1 (2)Wealth Solutions1,341 1,380 (3)— — (2)(1)Elimination(17)(14)NANANANANATotal revenue$11,066 $11,013 — %— %— %(1)%1 %(1)Currency impact is determined by translating last year’s revenue at this year’s foreign exchange rates.(2)Fiduciary investment income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $8 million and $27 million, respectively.(3)Organic revenue growth (decline) includes the impact of intercompany activity, changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges.35Adjusted Operating MarginWe use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported operating margins is as follows (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended December 3120212020Revenue $12,193 $11,066 Operating income - as reported$2,090 $2,781 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 147 246 Transaction costs and other charges related to the combination and resulting termination (1)1,436 123 Operating income - as adjusted$3,673 $3,150 Operating margin - as reported17.1 %25.1 %Operating margin - as adjusted30.1 %28.5 %(1)As part of the terminated combination with WTW, certain transaction costs have been incurred by us in 2021. These costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees related to the combination, including planned divestitures that have been terminated, as well as certain compensation expenses and expenses related to further steps on our Aon United operating model as a result of the termination. Additionally, this includes the $1 billion Termination Fee paid in connection with the termination of the combination.Adjusted Diluted Earnings per ShareWe use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the items identified above, along with pension settlements and related income taxes, because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share data and percentages):Year Ended December 31, 2021U.S. GAAPAdjustmentsNon-GAAP AdjustedOperating income$2,090 $1,583 $3,673 Interest income11 — 11 Interest expense(322)— (322)Other income (1)152 (124)28 Income before income taxes 1,931 1,459 3,390 Income tax expense (2)623 — 623 Net income1,308 1,459 2,767 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests53 — 53 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,255 $1,459 $2,714 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$5.55 $6.45 $12.00 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted226.1 — 226.1 Effective tax rates (2)32.3 %18.4 %36Year Ended December 31, 2020U.S. GAAPAdjustmentsNon-GAAP AdjustedOperating income $2,781 $369 $3,150 Interest income6 — 6 Interest expense(334)— (334)Other income (3)13 — 13 Income before income taxes 2,466 369 2,835 Income tax expense (2)448 51 499 Net income2,018 318 2,336 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests49 — 49 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,969 $318 $2,287 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$8.45 $1.36 $9.81 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted233.1 — 233.1 Effective tax rates (2)18.2 %17.6 %(1)Adjusted Other income excludes gains from dispositions of $124 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021.(2)Adjusted items are generally taxed at the estimated annual effective tax rate, except for the applicable tax impact associated with accelerated tradename amortization, impairment charges, certain gains from dispositions, and certain transaction costs and other charges related to the combination and resulting termination, which are adjusted at the related jurisdictional rate. In addition, income tax expense for the year ended December 30, 2021 excludes the impact of remeasuring the net deferred tax liabilities in the U.K. as a result of the corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the second quarter of 2021.(3)There was $1 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2020, including the related tax effect, from discontinued operations recognized in Net Income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income.Free Cash FlowWe use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions):Years Ended December 3120212020Cash provided by operating activities$2,182 $2,783 Capital expenditures(137)(141)Free cash flow$2,045 $2,642 Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate FluctuationsBecause we conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the prior year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of $0.17 on earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2021 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.03 on earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2020, if 2019 results were translated at 2020 rates. Currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of $0.23 on adjusted earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2021 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.04 on adjusted earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2020, if 2019 37results were translated at 2020 rates. These translations are performed for comparative and illustrative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in our Financial Statements.LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityExecutive SummaryWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity in the near-term include cash flows provided by operations and available cash reserves; primary sources of liquidity in the long-term include cash flows provided by operations, debt capacity available under our credit facilities and capital markets. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, and shareholder dividends. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, available cash reserves, and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements in the next twelve months and over the long-term. Although there continues to be uncertainties around future economic conditions due to COVID-19, we have largely returned to normal levels of liquidity and will continue to monitor our needs as economic conditions change.In the third quarter of 2021, the Combination with WTW was terminated and on July 27, 2021, we paid the Termination Fee of $1 billion. Refer to “Termination of Business Combination Agreement” within Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information. The Termination Fee, along with other payments made in the third and fourth quarters related to terminating the combination with WTW, are reflected as an outflow to operating activities.Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums and claims in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities.In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of funds held on behalf of clients and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Funds held on behalf of clients, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. Fiduciary assets include funds held on behalf of clients comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $6.1 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and fiduciary receivables of $8.3 billion and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. While we earn investment income on the funds held in cash and money market funds, the funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes.We maintain multi-currency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2021, non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities may have been negative; however, the overall balance was positive.The following table summarizes our Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, and Fiduciary assets as of December 31, 2021 (in millions): Statement of Financial Position Classification Asset TypeCash and cashequivalentsShort-terminvestmentsFiduciaryassetsTotalCertificates of deposit, bank deposits, or time deposits$544 $— $3,475 $4,019 Money market funds— 292 2,626 2,918 Cash, Short-term investments, and Funds held on behalf of clients544 292 6,101 6,937 Fiduciary receivables— — 8,285 8,285 Total$544 $292 $14,386 $15,222 38Cash and cash equivalents and Funds held on behalf of clients increased $72 million in 2021 compared to 2020. A summary of our cash flows provided by and used for operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 3120212020 (1)(As Revised)Cash provided by operating activities$2,182 $2,783 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities$49 $(679)Cash used for financing activities$(1,924)$(1,772)Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients$(235)$297 (1) Certain amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as presented in our financial statements previously filed in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K have been restated. Refer to Note 1 “Basis of Presentation” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $601 million, or 22%, from the prior year to $2,182 million. This amount represents net income reported, as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, amortization and impairments, and other non-cash income and expenses, as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the collection of receivables.Pension ContributionsPension contributions were $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2022, we expect to contribute approximately $74 million in cash to our pension plans, including contributions to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates.Investing ActivitiesCash flows provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 were $49 million, an increase of $728 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows provided by investing activities are sales of businesses, sales of short-term investments, and proceeds from investments. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for investing activities are acquisition of businesses, purchases of short-term investments, capital expenditures, and payments for investments. The gains and losses corresponding to cash flows provided by proceeds from investments and used for payments for investments are primarily recognized in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Short-term InvestmentsShort-term investments decreased $16 million at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. As disclosed in Note 14 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.Acquisitions and Dispositions of BusinessesDuring 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses for consideration of $14 million, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients, and the disposition of six businesses for a $218 million cash inflow, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients.During 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of six businesses for consideration of $368 million, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients, and the disposition of one business for a $30 million cash inflow, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients.Capital ExpendituresThe Company’s additions to fixed assets, including capitalized software, which amounted to $137 million in 2021 and $141 million in 2020, primarily related to the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, software development costs, and computer equipment purchases. 39Financing ActivitiesCash flows used for financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,924 million, an increase of $152 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for financing activities are issuances of debt, net of repayments, share repurchases, change in net fiduciary liabilities, dividends paid to shareholders, issuances of shares for employee benefit plans, transactions with noncontrolling interests, and other financing activities, such as collection of or payments for deferred consideration in connection with prior-year business acquisitions and divestitures.Share Repurchase ProgramWe have a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014, June 2017, and November 2020, and by $7.5 billion in authorized repurchases in February 2022 for a total of $27.5 billion in repurchase authorizations.The following table summarizes the Company’s Share Repurchase activity (in millions, except per share data):Years Ended December 3120212020Shares repurchased12.4 8.5 Average price per share$286.82 $206.28 Costs recorded to retained earningsTotal repurchase cost$3,543 $1,761 Additional associated costs— 2 Total costs recorded to retained earnings$3,543 $1,763 At December 31, 2021, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the Repurchase Program was approximately $1.7 billion. Under the Repurchase Program, we have repurchased a total of 149.6 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $18.3 billion.BorrowingsTotal debt at December 31, 2021 was $9.4 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Commercial paper activity during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows (in millions):Years Ended December 3120212020Total issuances (1)$4,478 $3,162 Total repayments(3,807)(3,275)Net issuances (repayments)$671 $(113)(1) The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for short-term working capital needs.Commercial paper may be issued in aggregate principal amounts of up to $1 billion under the U.S. Program and €625 million under the European Program, not to exceed the amount of our committed credit facilities, which was $1.75 billion at December 31, 2021. The aggregate capacity of the U.S. Program was increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 from $900 million to $1 billion. The aggregate capacity of the Commercial Paper Program remains fully backed by our committed credit facilities.Proceeds from commercial paper issued by Aon Corporation under the U.S. Program, where the aggregate principal was raised on July 26, 2021, were used to pay approximately $400 million of the Termination Fee on July 27, 2021.On December 2, 2021, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Aon Global Holdings plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, co-issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.60% Senior Notes set to mature on December 2, 2031. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.In November 2021, the Company’s $500 million 2.20% Senior Notes due November 2022 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year as of December 31, 2021.40On August 23, 2021, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Aon Global Holdings plc, a public limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, co-issued $400 million of 2.05% Senior Notes due August 2031 and $600 million of 2.90% Senior Notes due August 2051. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.On January 13, 2021, Aon Global Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales and a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon plc, issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of its 2.80% Senior Notes for the redemption of all $400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes, which were set to mature in March 2021 and classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2020. The redemption date was on February 16, 2021 and resulted in an insignificant loss due to extinguishment.On May 29, 2020, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of its 5.00% Senior Notes, which were set to mature on September 30, 2020, for the redemption of all $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes. The redemption date was on June 30, 2020 and resulted in a loss of $7 million due to extinguishment.On May 12, 2020, Aon Corporation issued $1 billion 2.80% Senior Notes due May 2030. Aon Corporation used a portion of the net proceeds on June 30, 2020 to repay its outstanding 5.00% Senior Notes, which were set to mature on September 30, 2020. We used the remainder to repay other borrowings and for general corporate purposes.Other Liquidity MattersDistributable ProfitsWe are required under Irish law to have available “distributable profits” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable profits are created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and, among other methods, through intercompany dividends or a reduction in share capital approved by the High Court of Ireland. Distributable profits are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g. retained earnings). On July 16, 2021, we received approval from the High Court of Ireland to complete a reduction in share premium to create distributable profits of $34.0 billion to support the payment of possible future dividends or future share repurchases, if and to the extent declared by the directors in compliance with their duties under Irish law. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had distributable profits in excess of $32.7 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively. We believe that we will have sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future. Credit FacilitiesWe expect cash generated by operations for 2021 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.As of December 31, 2021, we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: our $1.0 billion multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in September 2026 and our $750 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2023. In aggregate, these two facilities provide $1.75 billion in available credit. The $1.0 billion credit facility was entered into on September 28, 2021 and replaced the $900 million credit facility, which was scheduled to mature on February 2, 2022. Each of these primary committed credit facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA, tested quarterly. At December 31, 2021, we did not have borrowings under either facility, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the rolling year ended December 31, 2021.Shelf Registration StatementOn May 12, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, Class A Ordinary Shares and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.41Rating Agency RatingsThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at February 18, 2022 appear in the table below.Ratings Senior Long-term Debt Commercial Paper OutlookStandard & Poor’sA- A-2 StableMoody’s Investor ServicesBaa2 P-2 StableFitch, Inc.BBB+ F-2 StableGuarantees in Connection with the Sale of the Divested BusinessIn connection with the sale of the Divested Business, we guaranteed future operating lease commitments related to certain facilities assumed by the Buyer. We are obligated to perform under the guarantees if the Divested Business defaults on the leases at any time during the remainder of the lease agreements, which expire on various dates through 2025. As of December 31, 2021, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the lease guarantee were $40 million, with an estimated fair value of $5 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the lease commitments during the year ended December 31, 2021.Additionally, we are subject to performance guarantee requirements under certain client arrangements that were assumed by the Buyer. Should the Divested Business fail to perform as required by the terms of the arrangements, we would be required to fulfill the remaining contract terms, which expire on various dates through 2023. As of December 31, 2021, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the performance guarantees were $52 million, with an estimated fair value of less than $1 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the performance guarantees during the year ended December 31, 2021.Letters of Credit and Other GuaranteesWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of an LOC. We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $75 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $79 million at December 31, 2020. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.We have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $153 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $113 million at December 31, 2020.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 are comprised of principal payments on debt, interest payments on debt, operating leases, pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and purchase obligations.Operating leases are primarily comprised of leased office space throughout the world. As leases expire, we do not anticipate difficulty in negotiating renewals or finding other satisfactory space if the premise becomes unavailable. In certain circumstances, we may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to third parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved. Refer to Note 8 “Lease Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information.Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the ERISA and other regulations, as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions. Refer to Note 11 “Employee Benefits” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information.Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts. 42We had no other cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Aon plc, Aon Global Limited, Aon Global Holdings plc, and Aon Corporation together comprise the “Obligor group”. The following tables set forth summarized financial information for the Obligor group.Adjustments are made to the tables to eliminate intercompany balances and transactions between the Obligor group. Intercompany balances and transactions between the Obligor group and non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented as separate line items within the summarized financial information. These balances are presented on a net presentation basis, rather than a gross basis, as this better reflects the nature of the intercompany positions and presents the funding or funded position that is to be received or owed. No balances or transactions of non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented in the summarized financial information, including investments of the Obligor group in non-guarantor subsidiaries.

To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements where control is transferred over time, an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values.Costs incurred by the Company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs, are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.Commercial Risk Solutions includes retail brokerage, specialty solutions, global risk consulting and captives management, and Affinity programs. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services 45to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units transferred and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Reinsurance Solutions includes treaty reinsurance, facultative reinsurance, and capital markets. Revenue primarily includes reinsurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the inception of the reinsurance period for certain reinsurance brokerage, or more commonly, over the term of the arrangement in installments based on deposit or minimum premiums for most treaty reinsurance arrangements.Health Solutions includes consulting and brokerage, Human Capital, and voluntary benefits and enrollment solutions. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. For brokerage commissions, revenue is predominantly recognized at the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services using input or output measures, including units delivered or time elapsed, to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For Human Capital, revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time upon completion of the services. For arrangements recognized over time, revenue is based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation, including units delivered or time elapsed. Input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed. Revenue from voluntary benefits and enrollment solutions arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.Wealth Solutions includes retirement consulting, pension administration and investments. Revenue recognized for these arrangements is predominantly recognized over the term of the arrangement using input or output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For consulting arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed. Fees paid by customers for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time incurred, days elapsed, or reports delivered. Revenue from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed using input or output measures to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including hours worked, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time and materials incurred. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.PensionsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada, which are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted. The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in Compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in Other income. We used a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans; this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.46Recognition of Gains and Losses and Prior Service Certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost.Unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.As of December 31, 2021, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or PBO. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.The following table discloses our accumulated other comprehensive loss, the number of years over which we are amortizing the loss, and the estimated 2022 amortization of loss by country (in millions, except amortization period):U.K.U.S.OtherAccumulated other comprehensive loss $1,255 $1,551 $483 Amortization period7 - 266 - 2311 - 35Estimated 2022 amortization of loss$34 $67 $14 The U.S. had no unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2021. The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2021 was $40 million, and $(6) million for the U.K. and other plans, respectively.For the U.S. pension plans, we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2021, the market-related value of assets was $2.2 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of plan assets was $2.4 billion. Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.Rate of Return on Plan Assets and Asset AllocationThe following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of December 31, 2021:U.K.U.S.OtherExpected return on plan assets, net of administration expenses2.34%2.03 - 5.28%1.80 - 3.15%In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and other non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and other non-U.S. categories, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Target allocations are subject to change.47Impact of Changing Economic AssumptionsChanges in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our PBO at December 31, 2021 (in millions):Increase (decrease) in projected benefit obligation (1)25 BPS Change in Discount RateIncreaseDecreaseU.K. plans$(201)$219 U.S. plans$(89)$93 Other plans$(64)$69 (1)Increases to the PBO reflect increases to our pension obligations, while decreases in the PBO are recoveries toward fully-funded status. A change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the PBO.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2022 pension expense (in millions): 25 BPS Change in Discount RateIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncreaseDecreaseU.K. plans$(1)$1 U.S. plans$2 $(2)Other plans$1 $(1)Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our long-term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2022 pension expense (in millions): 25 BPS Change in Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncreaseDecreaseU.K. plans$(15)$15 U.S. plans$(5)$5 Other plans$(4)$4 The net unfunded pension balance has continued to improve in 2021, reflecting continued progress in reducing the funded status at risk. As a result, the potential impact of a hypothetical adverse change in discount rates and return seeking asset exposures would have a less significant impact as compared to prior years. A hypothetical discount rates decrease of 1% and return seeking assets decline of 10% would have resulted in expected balance sheet deterioration at 2021 of approximately $235 million, as compared to approximately $410 million in 2019, an improvement of approximately $175 million. This is largely due to greater amounts of liability matching assets and de-risking actions.Estimated Future ContributionsWe estimate cash contributions of approximately $74 million to our pension plans in 2022 as compared with cash contributions of $87 million in 2021.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames, customer-related and contract-based, or technology and other.Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component 48constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components are a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a quantitative analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a DCF model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.ContingenciesWe define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection.Share-Based PaymentsShare-based compensation expense is measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. For purposes of measuring share-based compensation expense, we consider whether an adjustment to the observable market price is necessary to reflect material nonpublic information that is known to us at the time the award is granted. No adjustments were necessary for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019. We also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Restricted Share UnitsRSUs are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.Performance Share AwardsPSAs are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved, which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.49The largest plan is the LPP, which has a three-year performance period. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense. The 2019 to 2021 performance period ended on December 31, 2021, the 2018 to 2020 performance period ended on December 31, 2020, and the 2017 to 2019 performance period ended on December 31, 2019. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2020 to 2022 and 2021 to 2023. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would not have increased our 2021 expense, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $7.6 million. Income TaxesWe earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset, historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors.We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination. We base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if determinable.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.Foreign Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign exchange rate risk. Our primary exposures include exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Indian rupee, and the Japanese yen. We use over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements.Additionally, some of our non-U.S. brokerage subsidiaries receive revenue in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in U.S. dollars, euro, and Japanese yen, but most of their expenses are incurred in British pounds. At December 31, 2021, we have hedged approximately 45% of our U.K. subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the U.S. dollar, euro, and Japanese yen transactions for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023. We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years.We also use forward and option contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany notes and current assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency and are subject to remeasurement.50The potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would be $48 million and $10 million at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.The translated value of revenues and expenses from our international brokerage operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were to translate prior year results at current year exchange rates, diluted earnings per share would have a favorable $0.17 impact during the year ended December 31, 2021. Further, adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure as defined and reconciled under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share,” would have a favorable $0.23 impact during the year ended December 31, 2021 if we were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates.Interest Rate RiskOur fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates and, as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the U.S. and in continental Europe. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the year-end yield curve of 100 BPS would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $64 million to each of 2022 and 2023 pretax income. A corresponding increase in the year-end yield curve of 100 BPS would cause an increase, net of derivative positions, of $64 million to each of 2022 and 2023 pre-tax income.We have long-term debt outstanding, excluding the current portion, with a fair market value of $9.2 billion and $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair value was greater than the carrying value by $0.9 billion at December 31, 2021, and $1.4 billion greater than the carrying value at December 31, 2020. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 8% or an increase of 9%, respectively, at December 31, 2021.We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events.51",2023-12-30 20:31:14.219050

The increase was driven by a decrease in operating expenses as listed above and organic revenue growth of 6%.•Due to the factors set forth above, Net income was $2.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 102%, from 2021.•Diluted earnings per share increased 119% to $12.14 per share during the twelve months of 2022 compared to $5.55 per share for the prior year period.•Cash flows provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 48%, from $2.2 billion in 2021, primarily due to the Transaction Costs paid in the prior year period, and strong operating income growth, partially offset by higher incentive compensation payments made in the current year following strong performance in 2021. We focus on four key metrics not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for 2022:•Organic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 6% in 2022, compared to 9% organic growth in the prior year.•Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 30.8% in 2022, compared to 30.1% in the prior year. The increase in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects 6% organic revenue growth and a higher fiduciary investment income, partially offset by increased expenses and investments in long-term growth. •Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $13.39 per share in 2022, an increase of $1.39 per share, or 12%, from $12.00 per share in 2021. The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share primarily reflects strong operational performance and effective capital management, highlighted by $3.2 billion of share repurchase during 2022, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.•Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $3.0 billion in 2022, an increase of $978 million, or 48%, from $2.0 billion in 2021, reflecting an increase in Cash flows from operations, partially offset by a $59 million increase in capital expenditures.30ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCEFor many companies, the management of ESG risks and opportunities has become increasingly important, and ESG-related challenges, such as extreme weather events, supply chain disruptions, cyber events, regulatory changes, ongoing public health impacts, and the increased focus on workforce resilience in highly varied work environments continue to create volatility and uncertainty for our clients. Aon offers a wide range of risk assessment, consulting and advisory solutions, many of which are significant parts of our core business offerings, designed to address and manage ESG issues for clients, and to enable our clients to create more sustainable value. We view ESG risks as presenting an important opportunity for Aon to work together as one firm to address client needs and improve our impact on ESG matters.REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTSSummary of ResultsOur consolidated results are as follow (in millions, except per share data):Years Ended December 31202220212020Revenue Total revenue$12,479 $12,193 $11,066 Expenses Compensation and benefits6,477 6,738 5,905 Information technology509 477 444 Premises289 327 291 Depreciation of fixed assets151 179 167 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets113 147 246 Other general expense1,271 2,235 1,232 Total operating expenses8,810 10,103 8,285 Operating income3,669 2,090 2,781 Interest income18 11 6 Interest expense(406)(322)(334)Other income (expense)(125)152 13 Income before income taxes3,156 1,931 2,466 Income tax expense510 623 448 Net income2,646 1,308 2,018 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests57 53 49 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$2,589 $1,255 $1,969 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$12.14 $5.55 $8.45 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted213.2 226.1 233.1 31Consolidated Results for 2022 Compared to 2021RevenueTotal revenue increased $286 million, or 2%, to $12.5 billion in 2022, compared to $12.2 billion in 2021.

The decrease was primarily driven by a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 2% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures, and other. This decrease was offset by organic revenue growth of 3% in 2022 driven by high demand and project related work related to pension risk transfer and ongoing impacts of regulatory changes. In Investments, a decrease in AUM-based delegated investment management revenue due to equity market and interest rate movements was partially offset by higher advisory demand and project-related work.Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits decreased $261 million, or 4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a $293 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation and a $245 million decrease in Transaction Costs, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth.Information TechnologyInformation technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, increased $32 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by ongoing investments in Aon Business Services-enabled technology platforms and technology to drive long-term growth, partially offset by a $17 million decrease in Transaction Costs.PremisesPremises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, decreased $38 million, or 12%, in 2022 compared to 2021.

Interest IncomeInterest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on Funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $18 million in 2022, an increase of $7 million, or 64%, from 2021.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $406 million in 2022, an increase of $84 million, or 26%, from 2021.

The 2022 tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items, primarily the favorable impacts of share-based payments.The 2021 tax rate was primarily driven by the impact of the Termination Fee, the U.K. statutory tax rate increase, and the tax benefit of share-based payments. The U.K. enacted legislation in the second quarter of 2021 which increases the corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% with effect from April 1, 2023 and the Company remeasured its U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly.Net Income Attributable to Aon ShareholdersNet income attributable to Aon shareholders increased to $2.6 billion, or $12.14 per diluted share, in 2022, compared to $1.3 billion, or $5.55 per diluted share, in 2021.Consolidated Results for 2021 Compared to 2020We have elected not to include a discussion of our consolidated results for 2021 compared to 2020 in this report in reliance upon Instruction 1 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K. This discussion can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022.Non-GAAP MetricsIn our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted net income per share, other income (expense), as adjusted, adjusted effective tax rate, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.33Organic Revenue GrowthWe use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of certain intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Years EndedDec 31, 2022Dec 31, 2021% ChangeLess: Currency Impact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (3)Commercial Risk Solutions$6,715 $6,635 1 %(4)%1 %(2)%6 %Reinsurance Solutions2,190 1,997 10 (3)1 4 8 Health Solutions2,224 2,154 3 (3)— (2)8 Wealth Solutions1,367 1,426 (4)(5)— (2)3 Elimination(17)(19)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$12,479 $12,193 2 %(4)%1 %(1)%6 % Years EndedDec 31, 2021Dec 31, 2020% ChangeLess: Currency Impact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures & OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (3)Commercial Risk Solutions$6,635 $5,861 13 %2 %— %— %11 %Reinsurance Solutions1,997 1,814 10 2 — — 8 Health Solutions2,154 2,067 4 2 — (8)10 Wealth Solutions1,426 1,341 6 3 — 1 2 Elimination(19)(17)NANANANANATotal revenue$12,193 $11,066 10 %2 %— %(1)%9 %(1)Currency impact is determined by translating last year’s revenue at this year’s foreign exchange rates.(2)Fiduciary investment income for the years ended December 31, 2022 2021, and 2020 was $76 million, $8 million, and $27 million, respectively.(3)Organic revenue growth includes the impact of certain intercompany activity, changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges.34Adjusted Operating MarginWe use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported operating margins is as follows (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended December 3120222021Revenue $12,479 $12,193 Operating income - as reported$3,669 $2,090 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 113 147 Transaction costs and other charges related to the combination and resulting termination (1)— 1,436 Legal settlements (2)$58 $— Operating income - as adjusted3,840 3,673 Operating margin - as reported29.4 %17.1 %Operating margin - as adjusted30.8 %30.1 %(1)As part of the terminated combination with WTW, certain transaction costs were incurred by the Company through the third quarter of 2021. These costs included advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees related to the combination, including planned divestitures, some of which were terminated, as well as certain compensation expenses and expenses related to further steps on our Aon United operating model as a result of the termination. Additionally, this includes the $1 billion Termination Fee paid in connection with the termination of the combination.(2)In connection with certain legal settlements reached, a $58 million charge was recognized in the second quarter of 2022.35Adjusted Diluted Earnings per ShareWe use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses are the best indicators of our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share data and percentages):Year Ended December 31, 2022U.S. GAAPAdjustmentsNon-GAAP AdjustedOperating income$3,669 $171 $3,840 Interest income18 — 18 Interest expense(406)— (406)Other income (expense) (1)(125)170 45 Income before income taxes 3,156 341 3,497 Income tax expense (2)510 75 585 Net income2,646 266 2,912 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests57 — 57 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$2,589 $266 $2,855 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$12.14 $1.25 $13.39 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted213.2 — 213.2 Effective tax rates (2)16.2 %16.7 %Year Ended December 31, 2021U.S. GAAPAdjustmentsNon-GAAP AdjustedOperating income $2,090 $1,583 $3,673 Interest income11 — 11 Interest expense(322)— (322)Other income (expense) (3)152 (124)28 Income before income taxes 1,931 1,459 3,390 Income tax expense (2)623 — 623 Net income1,308 1,459 2,767 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests53 — 53 Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$1,255 $1,459 $2,714 Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$5.55 $6.45 $12.00 Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted226.1 — 226.1 Effective tax rates (2)32.3 %18.4 %(1)To further its pension de-risking strategy the Company purchased an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans that will settle certain obligations. A non-cash settlement charge totaling $170 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022 which is excluded from Adjusted Other income (expense).(2)Adjusted items are generally taxed at the estimated annual effective tax rate, except for the applicable tax impact associated with certain transaction costs and other charges related to the combination and resulting termination, as well as certain legal and pension settlements, which are adjusted at the related jurisdictional rate. In addition, income tax expense for the year ended December 30, 2021 excludes the impact of remeasuring the net deferred tax liabilities in the U.K. as a result of the corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the second quarter of 2021.(3)Adjusted Other income (expense) excludes gains from dispositions of $124 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021.36Free Cash FlowWe use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions):Years Ended December 3120222021Cash provided by operating activities$3,219 $2,182 Capital expenditures(196)(137)Free cash flow$3,023 $2,045 Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate FluctuationsBecause we conduct business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the prior year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates.Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.33 on earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2022 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of $0.17 on earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2021, if 2020 results were translated at 2021 rates.Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.44 on adjusted earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2022 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of $0.23 on adjusted earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2021, if 2020 results were translated at 2021 rates. These translations are performed for comparative and illustrative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in our Financial Statements.LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidityExecutive SummaryWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity in the near-term include cash flows provided by operations and available cash reserves; primary sources of liquidity in the long-term include cash flows provided by operations, debt capacity available under our credit facilities, and capital markets. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, and shareholder dividends. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, available cash reserves, and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements in the next twelve months and over the long-term.Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums and claims in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities.In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of funds held on behalf of clients and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make 37payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Funds held on behalf of clients, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. Fiduciary assets include funds held on behalf of clients comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $6.4 billion and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and fiduciary receivables of $9.5 billion and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. While we earn investment income on the funds held in cash and money market funds, the funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes.We maintain multi-currency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2022, non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities may have been negative; however, the overall balance was positive.The following table summarizes our Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, and Fiduciary assets as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): Statement of Financial Position Classification Asset TypeCash and cashequivalentsShort-terminvestmentsFiduciaryassetsTotalCertificates of deposit, bank deposits, or time deposits$690 $— $3,515 $4,205 Money market funds— 452 2,871 3,323 Cash, Short-term investments, and funds held on behalf of clients690 452 6,386 7,528 Fiduciary receivables— — 9,514 9,514 Total$690 $452 $15,900 $17,042 Cash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients increased $431 million in 2022 compared to 2021.

Generally, the primary drivers of cash flow provided by financing activities are issuances of debt, changes in net fiduciary liabilities, and proceeds from issuance of shares.Share Repurchase ProgramWe have a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014, June 2017, and November 2020, and by $7.5 billion in February 2022 for a total of $27.5 billion in repurchase authorizations.The following table summarizes the Company’s Share Repurchase activity (in millions, except per share data):Years Ended December 3120222021Shares repurchased11.1 12.4 Average price per share$289.76 $286.82 Repurchase costs recorded to accumulated deficit$3,203 $3,543 At December 31, 2022, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the Repurchase Program was approximately $6.0 billion.

In November 2021, the Company’s $500 million 2.20% Senior Notes due November 2022 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year as of December 31, 2021.On September 12, 2022, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Aon Global Holdings plc, a public limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, co-issued $500 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due September 2032. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.On February 28, 2022, Aon Corporation and Aon Global Holdings plc co-issued $600 million of 2.85% Senior Notes due May 2027 and $900 million of 3.90% Senior Notes due February 2052. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.On December 2, 2021, Aon Corporation and Aon Global Holdings plc co-issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.60% Senior Notes due December 2031. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.On August 23, 2021, Aon Corporation and Aon Global Holdings plc co-issued $400 million of 2.05% Senior Notes due August 2031 and $600 million of 2.90% Senior Notes due August 2051. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.On January 13, 2021, Aon Global Limited issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of its 2.80% Senior Notes for the redemption of all $400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes, which were set to mature in March 2021. The redemption date was on February 16, 2021 and resulted in an insignificant loss due to extinguishment.Aon Corporation has established a U.S. commercial paper program (the “U.S. Program”) and Aon Global Holdings plc has established a European multi-currency commercial paper program (the “European Program” and, together with the U.S. Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”). Commercial paper may be issued in aggregate principal amounts of up to $1 billion under the U.S. Program and €625 million under the European Program, not to exceed the amount of our committed credit facilities, which was approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The aggregate capacity of the Commercial Paper Program remains fully backed by our committed credit facilities. Commercial paper activity during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions):Years Ended December 3120222021 (2)Total issuances (1)$12,301 $4,478 Total repayments(12,366)(3,807)Net issuances (repayments)$(65)$671 (1) The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for short-term working capital needs.(2) Proceeds from commercial paper issued by Aon Corporation under the U.S. Program, where the aggregate principal was raised on July 26, 2021, were used to pay approximately $400 million of the Termination Fee on July 27, 2021.Other Liquidity MattersDistributable ProfitsWe are required under Irish law to have available “distributable profits” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable profits are created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and, among other methods, through intercompany dividends or a reduction in share capital approved by the High Court of Ireland. Distributable profits are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g. Accumulated deficit). As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had distributable profits in excess of $29.0 billion and $32.7 billion, respectively. We believe that we will have sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future. Credit FacilitiesWe expect cash generated by operations for 2022 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.40As of December 31, 2022, we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: our $1.0 billion multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in September 2026 and our $750 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2024. In aggregate, these two facilities provide approximately $1.8 billion in available credit.Each of these primary committed credit facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA, tested quarterly. At December 31, 2022, we did not have borrowings under either facility, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the rolling year ended December 31, 2022.Shelf Registration StatementOn May 12, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, class A ordinary shares and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.Rating Agency RatingsThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at February 17, 2023 appear in the table below.Ratings Senior Long-term Debt Commercial Paper OutlookStandard & Poor’sA-A-2StableMoody’s Investor ServicesBaa2P-2StableFitch, Inc.BBB+F-2StableLetters of Credit and Other GuaranteesWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a LOC. We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $74 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $75 million at December 31, 2021. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.We have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $173 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $153 million at December 31, 2021.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2022 are comprised of principal payments on debt, interest payments on debt, operating leases, pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and purchase obligations.Operating leases are primarily comprised of leased office space throughout the world. As leases expire, we do not anticipate difficulty in negotiating renewals or finding other satisfactory space if the premise becomes unavailable. In certain circumstances, we may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to third parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved. Refer to Note 8 “Lease Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information.Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the ERISA and other regulations, as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions. Refer to Note 11 “Employee Benefits” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information.Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts.41We had no other cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Aon plc, Aon Global Limited, Aon Global Holdings plc, and Aon Corporation together comprise the “Obligor group”. The following tables set forth summarized financial information for the Obligor group.Adjustments are made to the tables to eliminate intercompany balances and transactions between the Obligor group. Intercompany balances and transactions between the Obligor group and non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented as separate line items within the summarized financial information. These balances are presented on a net presentation basis, rather than a gross basis, as this better reflects the nature of the intercompany positions and presents the funding or funded position that is to be received or owed. No balances or transactions of non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented in the summarized financial information, including investments of the Obligor group in non-guarantor subsidiaries.

To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements where control is transferred over time, an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values.Costs incurred by the Company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs, are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.Commercial Risk Solutions includes retail brokerage, specialty solutions, global risk consulting and captives management, and Affinity programs. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services 44to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Reinsurance Solutions includes treaty reinsurance, facultative reinsurance, Strategy and Technology Group, and capital markets. Revenue primarily includes reinsurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the inception of the reinsurance period for certain reinsurance brokerage, or more commonly for treaty reinsurance arrangements, over the term of the arrangement in installments based on deposit or minimum premiums.Health Solutions includes consulting and brokerage, Human Capital, and Consumer Benefits Solutions. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. For brokerage commissions, revenue is predominantly recognized at the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services using input or output measures, including units delivered or time elapsed, to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For Human Capital, revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time upon completion of the services. For arrangements recognized over time, revenue is based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation, including units delivered or time elapsed. Input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed. Revenue from Consumer Benefits Solutions arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.Wealth Solutions includes retirement consulting, pension administration and investments. Revenue recognized for these arrangements is predominantly recognized over the term of the arrangement using input or output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For consulting arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed. Fees paid by customers for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time incurred, days elapsed, or reports delivered. Revenue from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed using input or output measures to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including hours worked, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time and materials incurred. Revenue generated from our delegated investment business is generally earned as an agreed percentage based on AUM and, to a lesser extent, based on performance fees. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.PensionsWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada, which are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted.The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in Compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in Other income (expense). We used a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans; this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.45Recognition of Gains and Losses and Prior Service Certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost.Unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.As of December 31, 2022, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or PBO. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.The following table discloses our accumulated other comprehensive loss, the number of years over which we are amortizing the loss, and the estimated 2023 amortization of loss by country (in millions, except amortization period):U.K.U.S.OtherAccumulated other comprehensive loss $1,761 $1,305 $437 Amortization period7 to 25 years6 to 23 years11 to 34 yearsEstimated 2023 amortization of loss$74 $34 $13 The U.S. had no unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2022. The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2022 was $35 million, and $(6) million for the U.K. and other plans, respectively.For the U.S. pension plans, we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2022, the market-related value of assets was $1.8 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of plan assets was $1.5 billion. Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.Rate of Return on Plan Assets and Asset AllocationThe following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of December 31, 2022:U.K.U.S.OtherExpected return on plan assets, net of administration expenses5.34%6.82%4.20 - 4.85%In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and other non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and other non-U.S. categories, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Target allocations are subject to change.46Impact of Changing Economic AssumptionsChanges in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our PBO at December 31, 2022 (in millions):Increase (decrease) in projected benefit obligation (1)25 BPS Change in Discount RateIncreaseDecreaseU.K. plans$(95)$(98)U.S. plans$(53)$56 Other plans$(39)$41 (1)Increases to the PBO reflect increases to our pension obligations, while decreases in the PBO are recoveries toward fully-funded status. A change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the PBO.Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2023 pension expense (in millions): 25 BPS Change in Discount RateIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncreaseDecreaseU.K. plans$(3)$3 U.S. plans$— $— Other plans$— $— Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our long-term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2023 pension expense (in millions): 25 BPS Change in Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsIncrease (decrease) in expenseIncreaseDecreaseU.K. plans$(9)$9 U.S. plans$(4)$4 Other plans$(3)$3 Estimated Future ContributionsWe estimate cash contributions of approximately $61 million to our pension plans in 2023 as compared with cash contributions of $59 million in 2022.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either customer-related and contract-based, technology, tradenames or other intangibles.Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components are a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. We aggregate components of any operating segments that have similar economic characteristics into a single reporting unit.47When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a quantitative analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a DCF model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry.We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that an asset group’s carrying value may not be recoverable. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.ContingenciesWe define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until all contingencies are resolved.Share-Based PaymentsShare-based compensation expense is measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. For purposes of measuring share-based compensation expense, we consider whether an adjustment to the observable market price is necessary to reflect material nonpublic information that is known to us at the time the award is granted. No adjustments were necessary for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. We also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Restricted Share UnitsRSUs are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.Performance Share AwardsPSAs are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved, which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.The largest plan is the LPP, which has a three-year performance period. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense. The 2020 to 2022 performance period ended on December 31, 2022, the 2019 to 2021 performance period ended on December 31, 2021, and the 2018 to 2020 performance period ended on December 31, 2020. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2021 to 482023 and 2022 to 2024. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2022 expense by approximately $2.6 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $7.7 million. Income TaxesWe earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset, historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors.We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination. We base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if determinable.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.Foreign Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign exchange rate risk. Our primary exposures include exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Indian rupee, and the Japanese yen. We use over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements.Additionally, some of our non-U.S. brokerage subsidiaries receive revenue in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in U.S. dollars, euro, and Japanese yen, but most of their expenses are incurred in British pounds. At December 31, 2022, we have hedged approximately 45% of our U.K. subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the U.S. dollar, euro, and Japanese yen transactions for the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2024. We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years.We also use forward and option contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany notes and current assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency and are subject to remeasurement.The potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would be $19 million and $9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.49The translated value of revenues and expenses from our international brokerage operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were to translate prior year results at current year exchange rates, diluted earnings per share would have an unfavorable $0.33 impact during the year ended December 31, 2022. Further, adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure as defined and reconciled under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share,” would have an unfavorable $0.44 impact during the year ended December 31, 2022 if we were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates.Interest Rate RiskOur fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates and, as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the U.S. and in continental Europe. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the year-end yield curve of 100 BPS would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $67 million to each of 2023 and 2024 pretax income. A corresponding increase in the year-end yield curve of 100 BPS would cause an increase, net of derivative positions, of $67 million to each of 2023 and 2024 pre-tax income.We have long-term debt outstanding, excluding the current portion, with a fair market value of $8.7 billion and $9.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value was less than the carrying value by $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022, and $0.9 billion greater than the carrying value at December 31, 2021. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 7% or an increase of 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2022.We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events.50",2023-12-30 20:31:20.325508
