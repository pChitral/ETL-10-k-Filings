813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2013,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe develop EDA software, hardware and IP. We license software and IP, sell or lease hardware technology, provide maintenance for our offerings and provide engineering and education services to help manage and accelerate product development processes for semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ICs and electronics systems. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from semiconductor and electronics systems manufacturers and designers and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects. As a result, our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers' business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products.26Table of ContentsWe have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the heading ""Results of Operations"" and ""Liquidity and Capital Resources."" Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income (loss) and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, business combinations, intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Accounting for Income Taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method. We also apply a two-step approach to determine the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions.We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision (benefit) for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision (benefit) for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. We give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. For the year ended December 29, 2012, we judged that our history of operating profits in the United States, and our expectations of future profits, considering our software ratable revenue recognition model and ending backlog of revenue as of December 29, 2012 were sufficient positive evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance against our United States deferred tax assets. However, if in the future, we determine that we no longer meet the realization threshold for some or all of our deferred tax assets then we would need to establish a valuation allowance that could result in a material provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made. For an additional description of the valuation allowance, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.27Table of ContentsWe only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. To determine when a tax position is effectively settled, we must estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would re-review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed. We must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal year-end. These judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for other reasons. In addition, we are required by the IRS to disclose uncertain tax positions taken on our federal tax returns. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For the year ended December 29, 2012, we made the judgment that we had effectively settled certain tax positions related to the State of California Franchise Tax Board, or the FTB, examination of our California tax returns for the 2001 through 2003 tax years that resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit. For additional descriptions of our effective settlements, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition We begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: •We have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; •Delivery has occurred; •The fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement; and •Collectibility of the fee is probable. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. We must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable, and we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments, products or services.For installment contracts that do not include a substantial up-front payment, we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. While we do not expect our experience to change, if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Generally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment. In general, revenue for product and maintenance associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license, commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product. The allocation of revenue to maintenance is based on a percentage of the total contract value, as determined by the length of the contract. In general, product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized up-front, upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met, and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. A relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an up-front basis. Sale of our hardware products generally involves the following deliverables: the hardware product and its related essential software, and maintenance for the hardware and the software. Consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential 28Table of Contentssoftware is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Revenue from services contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. If a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement, or MEA, that includes a software contract, revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances, and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations.If a group of contracts is so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such arrangements are deemed to be an MEA. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, an MEA. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an MEA can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts, which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved. For example, a term or perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in up-front revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an MEA when it is executed within close proximity, or in contemplation of, other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer, in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the MEA instead of up-front. For an MEA that includes software and nonsoftware elements, we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met. In these circumstances, there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows: •Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE;•Third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE; and •Best estimate of the selling price, or BESP. We calculate the BESP of our hardware products based on our pricing practices, including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products, because VSOE or TPE cannot be established. Our process for determining BESP for our software deliverables without VSOE or TPE takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Key external and internal factors considered in developing the BESPs include prices charged by us for similar arrangements, historical pricing practices and the nature of the product. In addition, when developing BESPs, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the BESP of the deliverables in our arrangements.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. This allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers, historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve. While we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions, which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected change in a customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customer's payment trends, or a downward trend in the volume of business in the semiconductor sector, are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 29Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to acquired tangible assets and liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life over which we amortize our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.Intangible Asset and Goodwill ImpairmentsWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including certain intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset group's carrying amount. Recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group, excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment is required in: •Identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances;•Forecasting future operating results; and •Estimating the proceeds, if any, from the disposition of long-lived or intangible asset group.We test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated and if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss.We completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsOn a quarterly basis, we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities, including the hedge and embedded conversion derivative associated with the 2.625% Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due 2015.Inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:•Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;•Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and•Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.30Table of ContentsThis hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. We recognize transfers between levels of this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency, are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Certain instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. For those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, our best estimate is used. While we believe the observable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in Level 2 and the unobservable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are reasonable, different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations. For an additional description of our fair value measurements see Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Results of OperationsFinancial results for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, reflect the following:•An increase in the aggregate amount of our product and maintenance revenue, primarily because of a general increase in the annualized values of software contracts with our customers and an increase in the sale and lease of our hardware products; •An increase in the cost of hardware products sold, primarily during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, driven by increases in the sale and lease of our hardware products;•An increase in employee-related costs, primarily consisting of costs related to hiring additional employees during fiscal 2012 and incremental costs related to employees added from our acquisition of Sigrity, Inc., or Sigrity, during fiscal 2012 and employees added from our fiscal 2011 acquisitions; •An increase in variable compensation due to increased revenue, bookings and operating performance;•Net recoveries of amounts in our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during fiscal 2010 and, to a lesser extent, fiscal 2011, from collection of certain receivables that had previously been reserved;•The agreements we reached in February 2011 to settle our derivative and securities litigation and the associated $15.8 million litigation charge we recorded during fiscal 2010; and •Benefits for income taxes in fiscal 2012 and 2010 related to the following:•During fiscal 2012, the release of the valuation allowance for a significant portion of our United States deferred tax assets based on our determination that it is more likely than not that we will realize these deferred tax assets in future periods and from the effective settlement of the California Franchise Tax Board, or FTB, examination of our tax returns for the 2001 through 2003 tax years; and •During fiscal 2010, the effective settlement of the IRS examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and the release of valuation allowance for our United States deferred tax assets that resulted from the increase in deferred tax liabilities from the intangible assets acquired with Denali during fiscal 2010. RevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software and IP, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, IP and hardware and providing engineering services. The timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of hardware and software products in the bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized over multiple periods or up-front, upon completion of delivery.31Table of ContentsWe seek to achieve a consistent mix of bookings with approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our bookings of a type for which the revenue is recurring, or ratable, in nature, and the remainder of the resulting revenue recognized up-front, upon completion of delivery. Our ability to achieve this bookings mix in any single fiscal quarter may be impacted by an increase in hardware sales beyond our current expectations, because product revenue for hardware sales is generally recognized up-front in the quarter in which delivery is completed.Approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our bookings during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was of a type for which the revenue is recurring, or ratable, in nature. We believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: •Competitiveness of our new technology; and •Size, duration, timing, terms and type of:•Contract renewals with existing customers;•Additional sales to existing customers; and•Sales to new customers.Revenue Mix We analyze our software, VIP and Design IP and hardware businesses by product group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into categories, as described in the various product groups below: Functional Verification, Hardware and IP: Products in this group, including the Incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the high-level, logical representation of an IC design is functionally correct, and for verification at the system and SoC levels. Our emulation hardware products, VIP products, memory sub-system models, and Design IP products are also included in this product group. Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, including the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used to create ICs that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, RF, memory, high-performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries. Included in this group are specialized verification products that simulate the operation of the design prior to manufacturing. The final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the IC.Digital IC Design: Products in this group, including the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to create and convert the high-level, logical representation of a digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint, and ultimately, produce the detailed design information describing how the IC will be manufactured. The final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the IC.System Interconnect Design: This product group consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro and OrCAD products. The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co-design of interconnects across ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions. The Sigrity signal and power integrity products we acquired during fiscal 2012 are included in this product group. Design for Manufacturing: Included in the DFM product group are our physical verification, manufacturing optimization, and layout analysis products. These products are used to analyze, optimize, and verify that the physical blueprint of the IC has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. While our primary focus in DFM is to address manufacturing effects in the upstream digital and custom design flows, those products included in this DFM category also are offered separately from our other tools. For an additional description of our current product strategy, see the discussion under the heading ""Products and Product Strategy"" under Part I, Item 1, ""Business."" 32Table of ContentsRevenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 and the change in revenue between years: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Product$839.1 $640.8 $471.6 $198.3 31 % $169.2 36%Services114.0 116.7 100.9 (2.7) (2)% 15.8 16%Maintenance373.3 392.3 363.5 (19.0) (5)% 28.8 8%Total revenue$1,326.4 $1,149.8 $936.0 $176.6 15 % $213.8 23%For software arrangements, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the duration of the arrangement and such revenue is allocated between product and maintenance revenue. As the duration decreases, the percentage of the total contract value that is allocated to maintenance revenue decreases and the percentage allocated to product revenue increases. Combined, product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily because of increased business levels, an increase in revenue related to the sale and lease of our hardware products and increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods. Maintenance revenue decreased on a standalone basis during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily because of the increased allocation to product revenue due to the gradual decline in the average duration of our time-based software license arrangements over the last three years.Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to reasons noted above and also due to the increase in revenue from the Denali business which we acquired in the second quarter of 2010. We expect the aggregate of product and maintenance revenue will increase during fiscal 2013 due to increases in the revenue from our software and IP products, partially offset by an expected decrease in revenue from our hardware products. Services revenue decreased during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily because certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects and to assist with pre-sales activities. Services revenue increased during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily because of cash collections from customers on orders fulfilled in years prior to 2011 for which revenue was recognized in fiscal 2011 upon receipt of cash payment, and because of higher utilization rates for our services personnel. We expect services revenue to decrease during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, as we expect certain of our design services engineers will continue to work on internal research and development projects, primarily related or our Design IP and VIP activities.Revenue by Product GroupThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups, and services and other during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010: 2012 2011 2010Functional Verification, Hardware and IP30% 30% 24%Custom IC Design23% 22% 26%Digital IC Design23% 22% 23%System Interconnect Design9% 9% 9%Design for Manufacturing6% 7% 7%Services and other9% 10% 11%Total100% 100% 100%As described in Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, 33Table of Contentswe estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ.The changes in the percentage of revenue contributed by the Functional Verification, Hardware and IP product group are generally related to changes in revenue related to our hardware products.Revenue by Geography Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions, except percentages) United States$567.6 $489.4 $382.7 $78.2 16 % $106.7 28%Other Americas23.0 25.1 22.2 (2.1) (8)% 2.9 13%Europe, Middle East and Africa262.4 234.9 207.2 27.5 12 % 27.7 13%Japan218.7 204.4 165.2 14.3 7 % 39.2 24%Asia254.7 196.0 158.7 58.7 30 % 37.3 24%Total revenue$1,326.4 $1,149.8 $936.0 $176.6 15 % $213.8 23%For the primary factors contributing to our increase in revenue across our geographies, see the general description under ""Revenue by Period"" above.Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue 2012 2011 2010United States43% 43% 41%Other Americas2% 2% 2%Europe, Middle East and Africa20% 20% 22%Japan16% 18% 18%Asia19% 17% 17%Total100% 100% 100%No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, and we recognize additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the United States dollar weakens in value against the Japanese yen and reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the United States dollar strengthens against the Japanese yen. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.""Cost of Revenue Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Product$73.4 $69.7 $31.4 $3.7 5 % $38.3 122 %Services72.6 81.5 83.0 (8.9) (11)% (1.5) (2)%Maintenance45.1 44.0 42.1 1.1 3 % 1.9 5 %Total cost of revenue$191.1 $195.2 $156.5 $(4.1) (2)% $38.7 25 %34Table of ContentsThe following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010: 2012 2011 2010Product9% 11% 7%Services64% 70% 82%Maintenance12% 11% 12%Cost of ProductCost of product includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our hardware and licensing of our software and IP products. Cost of product associated with our hardware products includes materials, assembly and overhead. These additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products. Cost of product also includes the cost of employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products, as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors.A summary of cost of product for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions, except percentages) Product-related costs$60.4 $59.2 $25.8 $1.2 2% $33.4 129%Amortization of acquired intangibles13.0 10.5 5.6 2.5 24% 4.9 88%Total cost of product$73.4 $69.7 $31.4 $3.7 5% $38.3 122% The changes in cost of product were due to the following: Change 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Hardware costs$0.5 $31.0Amortization of acquired intangibles2.5 4.9Other individually insignificant items0.7 2.4 $3.7 $38.3Hardware costs increased by $31.0 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in hardware business. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product increased during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, and during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Sigrity during fiscal 2012, our fiscal 2011 acquisitions and our acquisition of Denali during fiscal 2010. Cost of product depends primarily upon the mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period, and also depends upon the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties' intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology. For an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets, see Note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services decreased by $8.9 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a decrease in employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs. Certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects or to assist with pre-sales activities, resulting in lower cost of services expense. We expect to continue to deploy our services engineers on internal projects and pre-sales activities. There were no significant changes in cost of services during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. 35Table of ContentsCost of MaintenanceCost of maintenance includes the cost of our customer support services, such as telephone, online and on-site support, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and documentation of maintenance updates. There were no significant changes in cost of maintenance during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, and during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Factors that may cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring, acquisitions, foreign exchange rates and the impact of our variable compensation programs, which are driven by overall operating results. Our employee salary and other compensation-related costs increased during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, and during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to hiring additional employees for our research and development activities, the addition of employees from our acquisitions and higher variable compensation resulting from improved business levels.We expect our operating expenses to increase during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to expected hiring of research and development and sales personnel during fiscal 2013, the addition of employees in these areas throughout fiscal 2012 and from our acquisition of Sigrity. Our operating expenses are denominated in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.""Our operating expenses for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$342.3 $323.8 $305.6 $18.5 6% $18.2 6%Research and development454.1 400.7 376.4 53.4 13% 24.3 6%General and administrative112.1 92.9 86.4 19.2 21% 6.5 8% $908.5 $817.4 $768.4 $91.1 11% $49.0 6%36Table of ContentsOur operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: 2012 2011 2010Marketing and sales26% 28% 33%Research and development34% 35% 40%General and administrative8% 8% 9%Operating expenses68% 71% 82% Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$18.4 $22.3Marketing programs and events0.1 (3.5)Executive and other severance(3.1) 2.5Other individually insignificant items3.1 (3.1) $18.5 $18.2The increase in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, and during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, is primarily due to higher variable compensation resulting from improved business levels, hiring additional employees and the addition of employees from our acquisitions. We expect marketing and sales expense to increase in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to expected hiring during fiscal 2013 and due to the addition of employees from our acquisition of Sigrity during fiscal 2012. Research and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$46.8 $23.8Professional engineering services5.1 —Stock-based compensation3.0 0.2Facilities and other infrastructure costs(0.4) (3.4)Executive and other severance(2.2) 2.2Other individually insignificant items1.1 1.5 $53.4 $24.3The increase in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, and during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, is primarily due to hiring additional employees for our research and development activities, the addition of employees through our acquisitions, costs associated with design services engineers redeployed to internal research and development projects and higher variable compensation resulting from improved business levels. Our research and development expenses also increased during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, due to an increase in professional engineering services costs related to the continuing development of our products and technologies.37Table of ContentsWe expect research and development expense to increase during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to expected hiring for our research and development activities during fiscal 2013 and due to the addition of employees from our acquisition of Sigrity during fiscal 2012. General and AdministrativeThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$8.7 $3.4Net reductions in recoveries of allowance for doubtful accounts6.8 9.9Professional services4.2 (2.4)Stock-based compensation1.5 (0.5)Other individually insignificant items(2.0) (3.9) $19.2 $6.5We recorded net recoveries of our allowance for doubtful accounts of $6.6 million during fiscal 2011 and $16.5 million during fiscal 2010 because we collected certain receivables that previously had been included in our allowance for doubtful accounts. These recoveries resulted in reductions in our general and administrative expense during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 and, as a result, our general and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. We had previously recorded reserves for certain customers based on changes in our assessment of collectibility for those customers. The principal factor for the assessment at that time was a general deterioration of economic conditions having a significant impact on certain customers. These customers' business prospects eventually improved, and we were able to collect the majority of those receivables that had previously been reserved, resulting in recoveries of previously reserved bad debts.Stock-based CompensationStock-based compensation expense is recorded within the various components of our costs and expenses. Stock-based compensation expense increased $4.0 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, because of an increase in restricted stock outstanding and higher grant date fair values. Stock-based compensation did not change significantly during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. We expect stock-based compensation to increase during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, because we expect that new awards granted during fiscal 2013 will have higher grant date fair values compared to grants made in previous years.

For an additional description of these restructuring plans, see Note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management's estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. The following table presents restructuring and other charges for our restructuring plans:SeveranceandBenefits ExcessFacilities Other Total (In millions)Fiscal 2012$— $0.1 $— $0.1Fiscal 2011(0.9) 1.3 — 0.4Fiscal 20105.2 1.2 3.8 10.2Restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2010 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to our restructuring plans. Restructuring and other charges (credits) recorded during fiscal 2012 and 2011 consisted primarily of adjustments to previous estimates of restructuring liabilities.Litigation ChargesIn February 2011, we agreed to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation. Accordingly, we recorded litigation charges of $15.8 million in our fiscal 2010 operating results. For an additional description of our legal proceedings and this settlement, see Note 15 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. 39Table of ContentsInterest Expense 2012 2011 2010 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense: 2011 Notes$— $2.0 $2.72013 Notes2.1 2.1 2.92015 Notes9.2 9.2 5.0Amortization of debt discount: 2011 Notes— 6.8 8.62013 Notes6.3 5.9 7.52015 Notes14.8 13.7 7.0Amortization of deferred financing costs: 2011 Notes— 0.7 0.82013 Notes0.4 0.4 0.52015 Notes1.9 1.9 0.9Other— 0.3 0.4Total interest expense$34.7 $43.0 $36.3Other Income, Net 2012 2011 2010 (In millions)Interest income$1.5 $1.3 $1.2Gains on sale of marketable debt and equity securities, net0.1 8.0 0.1Gains on sale of non-marketable equity investments2.9 8.3 4.9Loss on early extinguishment of debt— — (5.7)Gains (losses) on securities in Cadence's non-qualified deferred compensation trust4.5 (0.5) 2.6Gains on foreign exchange3.3 0.7 0.4Write-down of non-marketable investments(1.1) — (1.5)Other income, net0.1 0.3 0.5Total other income, net$11.3 $18.1 $2.5Income TaxesThe following table presents the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$(251.7) $23.2 $(189.3)Effective tax rate(133.7)% 24.3% 301.6%40Table of ContentsOur benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2012 primarily consisted of the following:•Tax benefit from the release of year-end valuation allowance of $219.6 million against our United States deferred tax assets;•Tax benefit of $36.7 million from the effective settlement of the State of California FTB's examination of our tax returns from 2001 through 2003;•Tax benefit from the release of $14.8 million of valuation allowance against our United States deferred tax assets due to the acquisition of intangible assets held by Sigrity during fiscal 2012, partially offset by;•Tax expense related to certain of our foreign subsidiaries; and•Excess tax benefit from employee stock compensation that was allocated to equity. Our release of the valuation allowance was based on our determination that the magnitude and history of our United States income, our achievement of a consistent multi-year history with approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our bookings being of a type for which revenue is recurring, or ratable, in nature, and our ending backlog of future revenue for the year ended December 29, 2012 provided us an objective source of future revenues that allowed us to more heavily weigh our projections of future income and collectively provided us with sufficient positive evidence that it is more likely than not that we will realize a significant amount of our United States deferred tax assets. We maintained a valuation allowance of $74.3 million on certain of our deferred tax assets because the realization of these deferred tax assets require future income of a specific character or amount that we considered uncertain. Our fiscal 2011 provision for income taxes is primarily related to $11.4 million of tax expense on certain of our foreign subsidiaries, $5.4 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation that were allocated to stockholders' equity, and $4.1 million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits that was partially offset by $5.0 million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities resulting from a fiscal 2011 business combination.Our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes is primarily related to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest of $147.9 million as a result of our effective settlement of certain tax matters with the IRS in August 2010 and the release of $66.7 million of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of intangibles with Denali in June 2010. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, enacted in January 2013, retroactively extended the United States federal research tax credit from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. We expect to recognize a period-specific tax benefit of approximately $5.8 million for the fiscal 2012 federal research tax credit during our first quarter of fiscal 2013. We may also recognize an additional period-specific tax benefit of approximately $33.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 related to uncertain tax positions recorded in a prior business combination. For further discussion regarding our income taxes, including the status of examinations by tax authorities and considerations related to the establishment or release of valuation allowance, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 January 1, 2011 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments$827.1 $604.6 $570.1 $222.5 $34.5Net working capital$174.0 $48.6 $181.9 $125.4 $(133.3)Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term InvestmentsAs of December 29, 2012, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $827.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $604.6 million as of December 31, 2011.During fiscal 2012, we began to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately $100 million in marketable debt securities, including corporate debt securities, United States Treasury securities, United States government agency securities, bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are included in short-term investments as of December 29, 2012. Our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy, 41Table of Contentswhich governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio. Our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk, interest rate risk and general market risk, as outlined in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors.""Our primary source of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2012 and 2011 was customer payments for products, maintenance and services. We also received cash from stock purchases under our ESPP and from the exercise of stock options.Our primary use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2012 and 2011 was payments relating to salaries, benefits, other employee-related costs and other operating expenses. During fiscal 2012 and 2011 we used cash for our acquisitions, including our acquisition of Sigrity during fiscal 2012, and to purchase property, plant and equipment. During fiscal 2011, we also used cash to pay the remaining balance on our 2011 Notes, and to pay amounts related to the settlement of our securities and derivative litigation. Approximately 50% of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 29, 2012. Our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations. We do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations. In the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund United States liquidity, we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds. For further discussion regarding our income taxes, including the unrecognized tax liability for indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.On December 12, 2012, we entered into a $250 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the credit facility may be used to finance working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other business purposes. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are payable on or before December 12, 2017. The credit facility contains customary negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make certain investments, dispose of certain assets and make certain payments. In addition, the credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than 3 to 1, subject to certain exceptions, and requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3 to 1. For an additional description of this revolving credit facility see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.As of December 29, 2012, we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility. We expect that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, cash flows that are generated from operations, and cash available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.Net Working CapitalThe changes in net working capital were due to the following: Change 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Increase in cash and cash equivalents$124.8 $44.2Increase (decrease) in short-term investments97.7 (9.7)Increase (decrease) in prepaid expenses and other62.8 (14.1)Decrease (increase) in current portion of deferred revenue44.6 (3.0)(Increase) decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities(5.5) 51.1(Decrease) increase in inventories(7.1) 4.2Decrease in receivables, net(39.0) (55.1)Increase in current portion of convertible notes(153.0) (150.8)Other individually insignificant items0.1 (0.1) $125.4 $(133.3)The increase in prepaid expenses and other is primarily due to increases in prepaid income taxes. The increase in the current portion of convertible notes is due to the shift of the 2013 convertible notes, which mature in December 2013, from a long-term 42Table of Contentsliability to a current liability. The decrease in deferred revenue and the decrease in accounts receivable result from closer alignment between the timing of our revenue and cash collections and collections of accounts receivable during fiscal 2012. Our 2015 Notes are convertible into cash from December 30, 2012 through March 30, 2013 because our closing stock price exceeded $9.81 for at least 20 of the last 30 trading days prior to December 29, 2012. Accordingly, the net balance of the 2015 Notes of $308.8 million is classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2012. The 2015 Notes were convertible and therefore classified as a current liability as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, whereas they were classified as long-term as of January 1, 2011 because the stock price conversion condition had not been met in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The classification of the 2015 Notes as a current or long-term liability on the consolidated balance sheet is evaluated at each balance sheet date and may change from time to time, depending on whether the stock price conversion condition, as described above, has been met in a particular fiscal quarter. If the note holders elect to convert their 2015 Notes prior to maturity, any unamortized discount and transaction fees will be expensed at the time of conversion. If the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on December 29, 2012 we would have recorded an expense of $46.9 million associated with the conversion, comprised of $41.2 million of unamortized debt discount and $5.7 million of unamortized transaction fees.The classification of the liability associated with the cash conversion feature of the 2015 Notes, or the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative, and the 2015 Notes Hedges asset as current or long-term on our consolidated balance sheet corresponds with the classification of the 2015 Notes. As such, we classified the fair value of the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011. We also classified the fair value of the 2015 Notes Hedges as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The value of the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative liability and the value of the 2015 Notes Hedges asset offset one another and the changes in the fair value of these instruments resulted in no net change to our net working capital as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011.If the holders of our 2015 Notes elect to convert their notes into cash, we would be required to make cash payments of up to $350.0 million prior to the maturity of the 2015 Notes. In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the $350.0 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes currently trade at a premium to their if-converted value, and we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 Notes by the note holders between December 30, 2012 and March 30, 2013. However, if the holders of the 2015 Notes elect to convert their notes between December 30, 2012 and March 30, 2013 we expect to have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and access to our revolving credit facility to fund any payment resulting from a conversion.For an additional description of our 2015 Notes, and the conversion terms thereof, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.43Table of ContentsCash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$316.0 $240.3 $199.1 $75.7 $41.2The changes in cash flows from operating activities were due to the following: Change 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Net income, net of non-cash related gains and losses$138.5 $10.8Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effect of acquired businesses(62.8) 30.4 $75.7 $41.2Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items including a $240.4 million increase in deferred taxes, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements.If our customers experience adverse changes in the future, are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they may delay purchasing our products and services, or they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. Our customers' inability to fulfill payment obligations would adversely affect our cash flow. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. Though we have not experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations.In February 2011, all parties to our securities and derivative litigation agreed to settle the litigation. During fiscal 2011, we paid $16.4 million into a securities litigation settlement fund, which amount included our portion of the settlement consideration plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2011, we had paid, and our insurance carriers had paid, all amounts specified by the settlement agreement into the securities litigation settlement fund. The settlement was approved during fiscal 2012.We expect to pay an additional $4.3 million related to our previous restructuring activities, primarily for payments related to vacated facilities, net of expected sublease income.We expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including our operating results and the timing of our billings, collections and tax payments.44Table of ContentsCash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Cash used for investing activities$(201.2) $(56.5) $(285.1) $(144.7) $228.6The changes in cash flows from investing activities were due to the following: Change 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Purchases of available-for-sale securities$(121.2) $—Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired(22.4) 214.8Proceeds from the sale of long-term investments(9.7) (0.5)Purchases of property, plant and equipment(4.5) 3.4Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities8.5 9.8Proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities4.2 —Investment in venture capital partnerships and equity investments0.4 2.4Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment— (0.9)Other individually insignificant items— (0.4) $(144.7) $228.6During fiscal 2012, we began to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately $100 million in marketable debt securities. The purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2012 are primarily related to this portfolio of marketable debt securities. For an additional description of these securities, see ""Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments"" above.On July 2, 2012 we acquired Sigrity for total cash consideration of $78.5 million (net of cash acquired of $7.5 million) of which $64.3 million was paid at closing, and $14.2 million was deferred and is conditioned upon certain Sigrity shareholders remaining employees of Cadence over designated retention periods. We recorded expense of $3.5 million during fiscal 2012 related to this deferred purchase consideration and will expense the remaining $10.7 million over the remaining retention periods and we include these deferred payments as a use of cash for operating activities in the period we make the payments. During fiscal 2012, we recorded cash used for investing activities of $64.3 million related to the Sigrity acquisition.In June 2010, we acquired Denali Software, Inc., or Denali, for cash consideration of $262.8 million (net of cash acquired of $46.7 million), of which $250.2 million was paid at closing and $12.6 million was deferred. Of the $12.6 million, $12.4 million was paid prior to December 29, 2012. For an additional description of our acquisition of Denali, see Note 4 in our notes to consolidated financial statements.In connection with our business combinations and asset acquisitions completed before December 29, 2012, we may be obligated to make payments based on, or subject to the satisfaction of, certain performance metrics. If performance is such that these payments are fully achieved, we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $18.8 million in cash during the next 40 months.During fiscal 2013, we expect to use cash for our purchase of Cosmic Circuits Private Limited. We also expect to continue our other investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, purchasing software licenses, business combinations, and making long-term equity investments.45Table of ContentsCash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Cash provided by (used for) financing activities$15.8 $(144.8) $59.9 $160.6 $(204.7)The changes in cash flows from financing activities were due to the following: Change 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In millions)Payments of 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes$150.0 $42.4Proceeds from the issuance of common stock13.0 6.1Tax effect related to employee stock transactions allocated to equity0.5 15.0Proceeds from issuance of 2015 Notes, net of issuance costs— (339.5)Proceeds from sale of 2015 Warrants— (37.5)Purchases of treasury stock— 40.0Purchase of 2015 Notes Hedges— 76.6Other individually insignificant items(2.9) (7.8) $160.6 $(204.7)During fiscal 2011, we paid the $150.0 million remaining principal balance on the 2011 Notes in full. During fiscal 2010, we issued $350.0 million principal amount of the 2015 Notes. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount that may become due to the holders of the 2015 Notes. In separate transactions, we also sold warrants, or the 2015 Warrants, to purchase our common stock at a strike price of $10.78 per share. We used an aggregate of $187.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 Notes to purchase in the open market $100.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes and $100.0 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes, and we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $40.0 million. In a separate transaction during fiscal 2010, we repurchased in the open market $5.5 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes. For an additional description of our 2011 Notes, 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes, and the conversion terms thereof, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and ""Net Working Capital,"" above. During fiscal 2013 we expect to pay the $144.5 million remaining principal balance on our 2013 Notes upon maturity in December 2013. The increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2012, as compared to 2011 and in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, resulted from an increase in employee participation in our ESPP, an increase in the exercise of stock options and an increase in our stock price. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 29, 2012, we had convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of $446.8 million and that mature between December 15, 2013, and June 1, 2015. The principal maturity value of these convertible notes is $494.5 million. The total cash or stock payable upon the early conversion of these notes, as determined by the indenture of each security, will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be due upon conversion.In the case of our 2015 Notes, we will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $7.55 per share. We entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 Notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion. In separate transactions, we sold warrants, or the 2015 Warrants, with a strike price of $10.78 per share. Although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the hedges to the $350.0 million outstanding principal value of the 2015 Notes, we will experience dilution to our stock and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding 2015 Warrants to the extent our average closing stock price exceeds $10.78 in any fiscal quarter until the 2015 Notes are converted and the 2015 Warrants are settled.46Table of ContentsAdditionally, holders may convert their 2015 Notes into cash during any quarter following a quarter in which our stock price closes above $9.81 for at least 20 of the last 30 trading days. While holders of the 2015 Notes would have the right to convert their notes if early conversion conditions are met, we do not expect holders of the 2015 Notes to convert their notes under such circumstances because the economic value to the holders of the notes has exceeded and likely will continue to exceed the cash received upon conversion. If the holders of the 2015 Notes elect to convert their notes between December 30, 2012 and March 30, 2013, we expect to have sufficient cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to our revolving credit facility to fund any payment resulting from a conversion. However, if holders of a significant portion of the 2015 Notes were to choose to convert at a time in which the notes are convertible, it could have a significant negative impact on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and liquidity.In the case of our 2013 Notes, we may owe shares of our common stock to the note holders upon conversion if our stock price exceeds $21.15 per share. We entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the dilution that may result from the issuance of shares upon conversion of the 2013 Notes. In separate transactions, we sold warrants with a strike price of $31.50 per share. We will experience dilution to our stock and to diluted earnings per share from the outstanding warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds $31.50.We expect to fund the maturity of the 2013 Notes in December 2013 with our cash on hand and cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2013. The 2013 Notes could become convertible prior to their maturity if certain conversion conditions are met. However, we do not currently expect any of the conversion conditions to be met prior to the maturity of the 2013 Notes. We also believe that we will have sufficient cash in future periods as well as access to our revolving credit facility to service the maturities of our 2015 Notes, but future changes in our cash position, cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, cash flows from financing activities, as well as general business levels and changes in our access to financing may impact our ability to settle the principal amount payable to the holders of the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes when they mature or convert.For an additional description of the 2015 Notes and 2013 Notes, the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and ""Net Working Capital,"" above.47Table of ContentsContractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2012 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions)Operating lease obligations$73.0 $20.0 $28.2 $14.4 $10.4Purchase obligations(1)43.6 32.1 11.2 0.3 —2023 Notes (2)0.2 0.2 — — —2013 Notes144.5 144.5 — — —2015 Notes (3)350.0 350.0 — — —Contractual interest payments28.9 12.1 15.3 1.5 —Current income tax payable and unrecognized tax benefits2.3 2.3 — — —Other long-term contractual obligations (4)71.1 — 58.8 1.8 10.5Total$713.6 $561.2 $113.5 $18.0 $20.9_________________(1)With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of December 29, 2012 or the earliest cancellation date.(2) The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash the remaining portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount. Therefore, we have included $0.2 million of principal of the 2023 Notes on the potential repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the less than 1 year column in the table above.(3)Holders of the 2015 Notes can convert their 2015 Notes into cash during a fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $9.81 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period preceding the end of the preceding fiscal quarter. This conversion condition was met for the 2015 Notes during the three months ended December 29, 2012, and the 2015 Notes are convertible into cash from December 30, 2012 through March 30, 2013. Accordingly, we classified the net balance of the 2015 Notes of $308.8 million as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2012. In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the $350.0 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes currently trade at a premium to their if-converted value, so we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 Notes by the note holders between December 30, 2012 and March 30, 2013.(4)Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $52.0 million that we estimate will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years. Included in this amount are $42.5 million of uncertain tax benefits recorded in a prior business combination for which the statute of limitation may expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisition-related liabilities.In connection with our acquisitions completed before December 29, 2012, we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $18.8 million in cash over the next 40 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 29, 2012, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.48Table of ContentsNew Accounting Standards In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting standards regarding the presentation of comprehensive income (loss) in the financial statements. The new standards require presentation of the components of net income (loss), the components of other comprehensive income (loss), and total comprehensive income (loss), either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. These standards eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders' equity. These standards were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and were to be applied retrospectively. We adopted these standards as of January 1, 2012 and disclosed components of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The adoption of this guidance affected only the presentation of our financial statements and had no impact on our consolidated operating results and financial position.In September 2011, the FASB issued new accounting standards that allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under these amendments, an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. These standards were effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted these standards as of January 1, 2012 and they did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.We periodically review new accounting standards. Although some of the accounting standards that have been issued may be applicable to us, we have not identified any other new accounting standards that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activity are transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies that can affect our results of operations. In certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, Japan in particular, our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. Most of our revenue is transacted in United States dollars. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in our revenues, except for our operations in Japan.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.49Table of ContentsThe following table provides information about our forward foreign currency contracts as of December 29, 2012. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts mature before or during February 2013. NotionalPrincipal WeightedAverageContractRate (In millions) Forward Contracts: Japanese yen$65.9 84.50European Union euro40.4 0.77Indian rupee21.2 54.66Canadian dollar13.1 0.99Chinese renminbi8.7 6.28Israeli shekel7.3 3.81Other12.5 N/ATotal$169.1 Estimated fair value$1.7 While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of marketable debt securities, our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and outstanding balances drawn on our credit facility, if any. We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, but the fair value of our marketable debt securities and our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents, any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges. Pursuant to our investment policy, we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer, other than in securities issued by the United States Treasury and United States government agencies.Our short-term investments as of December 29, 2012 include $98.5 million of marketable debt securities that may decline in value if market interest rates rise. Such variability in market interest rates may result in a negative impact on the results of our investment activities. As of December 29, 2012, an increase in the market rates of interest of 1% would result in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable debt securities by approximately $0.8 million.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 29, 2012.Interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable, so interest expense for periods when the credit facility is utilized could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Interest rates under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 29, 2012, we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility. See Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of our credit facility. Equity Price RiskConvertible NotesOur 2015 Notes and 2013 Notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock at conversion or at maturity of the notes. In addition, the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock. The amount of cash we may be required to pay, 50Table of Contentsor the number of shares we may be required to provide to note holders at conversion or maturity of these notes, is determined by the price of our common stock. The amount of cash or number of shares that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock.Upon the expiration of our 2015 Warrants, Cadence will issue shares of common stock to the purchasers of the warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrant strike price of $10.78 at that time. The following table shows the number of shares that Cadence would issue to 2015 Warrant counterparties at expiration of the warrants, assuming various Cadence closing stock prices on the dates of warrant expiration: Shares (In millions)$11.000.9$12.004.7$13.007.9$14.0010.7$15.0013.0$16.0015.1$17.0017.0$18.0018.6$19.0020.1$20.0021.4Prior to the expiration of the 2015 Warrants, for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding will increase when our average closing stock price for a quarter exceeds $10.78.For an additional description of our 2015 Notes and 2013 Notes, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and ""Liquidity and Capital Resources – Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources,"" under Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.""Equity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments. Our non-marketable investments had a carrying value of $7.3 million as of December 29, 2012, and $10.5 million as of December 31, 2011.51Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:47:26.127471
813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2014,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe develop solutions that our customers use to design increasingly small and complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and electronic devices. Our solutions are designed to help our customers reduce the time to bring an IC or electronic device to market and to reduce their design,development and manufacturing costs. Our product offerings include EDA software, emulation hardware and two categories of intellectual property, or IP, commonly referred to as verification IP, or VIP, and design IP. We provide maintenance for our hardware, software and IP product offerings. We also provide engineering services related to methodology, education, hosted design solutions and design services for advanced ICs and development of custom IP, which help our customers manage and accelerate their electronics product development processes. During fiscal 2013, we acquired Tensilica, Inc., or Tensilica, a privately held provider of configurable dataplane processing units, and Cosmic Circuits Private Limited, or Cosmic, a privately held provider of intellectual property used in system-on-chip design. These acquisitions, along with other acquired technology and internal development, expanded our design IP offering, enabling us to offer customized IP as well as broader analog and mixed signal IP solutions to our customers.Substantially all of our business is generated from semiconductor and electronics systems companies that deliver a wide range of electronics products in a number of market segments. The renewal of many of our customer contracts, and the decisions for new purchases are dependent upon our customers' commencement of new design projects. As a result, our business is significantly influenced by our customers' business outlook and investment in new designs and products. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under ""Results of Operations"" and ""Liquidity and Capital Resources."" Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition, business combinations, intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Accounting for Income Taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method. We also apply a two-step approach to determine the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions.We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision (benefit) for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision (benefit) for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.26Table of ContentsDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. We give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. For the year ended December 28, 2013, we judged that our history of operating profits in the United States, and our expectations of future profits, considering our software ratable revenue recognition model and ending backlog of revenue as of December 28, 2013, were sufficient positive evidence to determine that a significant portion of our United States deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realized in future years. However, if in the future, we determine that we no longer meet the realization threshold for some or all of our deferred tax assets then we would need to establish a valuation allowance that could result in a material provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made. For an additional description of the valuation allowance, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.We only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. To determine when a tax position is effectively settled, we must estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would re-review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed. We must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal year-end. These judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for other reasons. In addition, we are required by the IRS to disclose uncertain tax positions taken on our federal tax returns. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For additional descriptions of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition We begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: •We have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; •Delivery has occurred; •The fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement; and •Collectibility of the fee is probable.Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. For installment contracts that do not include a substantial up-front payment, we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. If we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. We have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable, without providing concessions on payments, products or services.Generally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. Key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment, including public information, historical and current financial statements and past collection history. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment. 27Table of ContentsIn general, revenue associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license, commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product. In general, product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized up-front, upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met, and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. A relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an up-front basis. Our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software, and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software. Consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Revenue from services contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. If a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement, or MEA, that includes a software contract, revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances, and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations.If a group of contracts is so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such arrangements are deemed to be an MEA. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, an MEA. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an MEA can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts, which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved. For example, a term or perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in up-front revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an MEA when it is executed within close proximity, or in contemplation of, other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer, in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the MEA instead of up front. For an MEA that includes software and nonsoftware elements, we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met. In these circumstances, there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows: •Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE;•Third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE; and •Best estimate of the selling price, or BESP. We calculate the BESP of our hardware products based on our pricing practices, including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products, because VSOE or TPE cannot be established. Our process for determining BESP for our software deliverables without VSOE or TPE takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Key external and internal factors considered in developing the BESPs include prices charged by us for similar arrangements, historical pricing practices and the nature of the product. In addition, when developing BESPs, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the BESP of the deliverables in our arrangements.28Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.Intangible Asset and Goodwill ImpairmentsWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including certain intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset group's carrying amount. Recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group, excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment is required in: •Identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances;•Forecasting future operating results; and •Estimating the proceeds, if any, from the disposition of long-lived or intangible asset group.We test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. We operate as a single reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated and if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss.We completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsOn a quarterly basis, we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities, including the hedge and embedded conversion derivative associated with our 2.625% Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due 2015.Inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:•Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;•Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and•Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.This hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. We recognize transfers between levels of this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. 29Table of ContentsThe types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency, are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Certain instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. For those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, our best estimate is used. While we believe the observable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in Level 2 and the unobservable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are reasonable, different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations. For an additional description of our fair value measurements see Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Results of OperationsFinancial results for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012 and 2011, reflect the following:•An increase in our product and maintenance revenue, primarily because of increased business levels, increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods, incremental revenue from the license of the IP that we acquired as part of our fiscal 2013 acquisitions and incremental revenue from our fiscal 2012 acquisition; •An increase in employee-related costs, including incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and costs related to hiring additional employees;•An increase in stock-based compensation;•An increase in restructuring charges due to restructuring activities during fiscal 2013;•An increase in amortization of acquired intangibles resulting from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions; and•A decrease in the benefit for income taxes in fiscal 2013 as compared to the benefit for income taxes recognized in fiscal 2012 that resulted from the release of a significant portion of our United States valuation allowance and from the effective settlement of a California Franchise Tax Board, or FTB, examination of our tax returns. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were 52-week years, while fiscal 2014 will be a 53-week year, which will impact revenue and expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. RevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products in the bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized over multiple periods or up front, upon completion of delivery. We seek to achieve a consistent mix of bookings with approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our bookings of a type for which the revenue is recurring in nature, and the remainder of the resulting revenue recognized up-front, upon completion of delivery. Our ability to achieve this bookings mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by hardware sales, because revenue for hardware sales is generally recognized up front in the period in which delivery is completed.Approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our bookings during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was of a type for which the revenue is recurring in nature. We believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: •Competitiveness of our new technology; and •Size, duration, timing, terms and type of:•Contract renewals with existing customers;•Additional sales to existing customers; and•Sales to new customers.30Table of ContentsRevenue Mix We have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies, including our software, hardware and IP offerings, into various product categories, as described below: Functional Verification, including Emulation Hardware and IP: Products in this group, including the Incisive functional verification platform, are used to verify that the high-level, logical representation of an IC design is functionally correct, and for verification at the system and SoC levels. Our emulation hardware products, VIP products, memory sub-system models, and design IP products are also included in this product group. Revenue related to our fiscal 2013 acquisitions is included in this product group.Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, including the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used to create ICs that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, mixed signal, custom digital, memory and RF designs. Included in this group are specialized verification products that simulate the operation of the design prior to manufacturing. Digital IC Design and Signoff: Products in this group, including the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to create and verify designs in conjunction with our functional verification capabilities, create a physical representation of logic models, and ultimately, produce the detailed design information describing how the IC will be manufactured. The final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the IC.System Interconnect Design: This product group consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro and OrCAD products. The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co-design of interconnects across ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions. Design for Manufacturing: Included in the DFM product group are our physical verification, manufacturing optimization, and layout analysis products. These products are used to analyze, optimize, and verify that the physical blueprint of the IC has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. While our primary focus in DFM is to address manufacturing effects in the upstream digital and custom design flows, those products included in this DFM category also are offered separately from our other tools. For an additional description of our current product strategy, see the discussion under the heading ""Products and Product Strategy"" under Part I, Item 1, ""Business."" Revenue by YearDuring fiscal 2013, we combined product and maintenance revenue into a single caption on the consolidated income statements because product and maintenance revenue is generally recognized from agreements that require customers to purchase both the product and associated maintenance in a bundled offering. We reclassified prior period product and maintenance revenue balances to conform to the current year presentation.The following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 and the change in revenue between years: Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$1,357.9 $1,212.4 $1,033.1 $145.5 12 % $179.3 17 %Services102.2 114.0 116.7 (11.8) (10)% (2.7) (2)%Total revenue$1,460.1 $1,326.4 $1,149.8 $133.7 10 % $176.6 15 %Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily because of increased business levels, increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods and incremental revenue recognized from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions. Services revenue decreased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily because of the redeployment, primarily during fiscal 2012, of certain of our design services engineers to internal research and development projects related to our design IP activities. Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily because of increased business levels, an increase in revenue related to the sale and lease of our hardware products and increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods. Services revenue decreased during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily because certain of our design services engineers were redeployed to internal research and development projects and to assist with pre-sales activities. While the macro-environment remains challenging, we expect product and maintenance revenue will increase during fiscal 2014 due to increases in revenue from our software and IP products.31Table of ContentsNo one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011.Revenue by Product GroupThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011: 2013 2012 2011Functional Verification, including Emulation Hardware and IP29% 30% 30%Custom IC Design25% 23% 22%Digital IC Design and Signoff23% 23% 22%System Interconnect Design10% 9% 9%Design for Manufacturing6% 6% 7%Services7% 9% 10%Total100% 100% 100%As described in Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ.The changes in the percentage of revenue contributed by the custom IC design product group for the years presented are primarily related to increased business levels during fiscal 2013. Revenue by Geography Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions, except percentages)United States$648.7 $567.6 $489.4 $81.1 14 % $78.2 16 %Other Americas22.9 23.0 25.1 (0.1) — % (2.1) (8)%Europe, Middle East and Africa303.6 262.4 234.9 41.2 16 % 27.5 12 %Japan195.8 218.7 204.4 (22.9) (10)% 14.3 7 %Asia289.1 254.7 196.0 34.4 14 % 58.7 30 %Total revenue$1,460.1 $1,326.4 $1,149.8 $133.7 10 % $176.6 15 %Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, and we recognize reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the Japanese yen weakens in value against the United States dollar and additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the Japanese yen strengthens against the United States dollar. Revenue for Japan was impacted by a weaker Japanese yen during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.""Revenue for Japan decreased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to business conditions facing our Japanese customers and the weaker Japanese yen. For the primary factors contributing to our increase in revenue in other geographies, see the general description under ""Revenue by Year,"" above.32Table of ContentsRevenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue 2013 2012 2011United States44% 43% 43%Other Americas2% 2% 2%Europe, Middle East and Africa21% 20% 20%Japan13% 16% 18%Asia20% 19% 17%Total100% 100% 100%Cost of Revenue Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$132.2 $118.5 $113.7 $13.7 12 % $4.8 4 %Services68.0 72.6 81.5 (4.6) (6)% (8.9) (11)%Total cost of revenue$200.2 $191.1 $195.2 $9.1 5 % $(4.1) (2)%The following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011: 2013 2012 2011Product and maintenance10% 10% 11%Services67% 64% 70%Cost of Product and MaintenanceCost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our hardware and licensing of our software and IP products, certain employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, cost of our customer support services, amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles, as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Costs associated with our hardware products include materials, assembly and overhead. These additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products.A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows: Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$108.2 $105.0 $103.2 $3.2 3% $1.8 2%Amortization of acquired intangibles24.0 13.5 10.5 10.5 78% 3.0 29%Total cost of product and maintenance$132.2 $118.5 $113.7 $13.7 12% $4.8 4% 33Table of ContentsCost of product and maintenance depends primarily upon hardware product sales in any given period, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, and also upon the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties' intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology. The changes in product and maintenance-related costs were due to the following: Change 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Hardware costs$7.1 $0.5Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs(4.5) 1.1Other items0.6 0.2 $3.2 $1.8Hardware costs increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, due to a higher volume of hardware products sold. Profit margins can fluctuate from period to period depending upon, among other things, the mix of software, hardware, and IP revenue and the cost of product associated with particular sales agreements. Profit margins on our hardware products may fluctuate based on customer pricing strategies, product competition and product life cycle. Profit margins on our hardware products decreased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. We expect lower profit margins on the sale of our hardware products during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily because our emulation hardware products will be in the fourth year of their product life cycle.Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs decreased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to redeployment of certain customer support employees to sales support roles. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, and during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions. We expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our fiscal 2013 acquisitions. For an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets, see Note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. The decrease of $4.6 million in cost of services during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to lower variable compensation and a decrease in the use of consulting services.Cost of services decreased by $8.9 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a decrease in employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs. Certain of our design services engineers were redeployed to internal research and development projects or to assist with pre-sales activities, resulting in lower cost of services expense. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Factors that may cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, foreign exchange rates and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results. Our employee salary and other compensation-related costs increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, and during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and hiring additional employees for our research and development and sales activities.We expect our operating expenses to generally increase during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily because fiscal 2014 will include a full year of operating expenses for additional employees added through our fiscal 2013 acquisitions, fiscal 2013 hiring of research and development and sales personnel and due to expected hiring during fiscal 2014.34Table of ContentsMany of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.""Our operating expenses for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$378.2 $342.3 $323.8 $35.9 10% $18.5 6%Research and development534.0 454.1 400.7 79.9 18% 53.4 13%General and administrative121.3 112.1 92.9 9.2 8% 19.2 21% $1,033.5 $908.5 $817.4 $125.0 14% $91.1 11%Our operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: 2013 2012 2011Marketing and sales26% 26% 28%Research and development37% 34% 35%General and administrative8% 8% 8%Operating expenses71% 68% 71% Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$26.0 $18.4Stock-based compensation5.4 (0.2)Professional services2.9 0.1Executive and other severance0.5 (3.1)Other items1.1 3.3 $35.9 $18.5The increase in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, and fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, is primarily due to the addition of employees from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and hiring of sales and marketing personnel. 35Table of ContentsResearch and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$57.7 $46.8Stock-based compensation11.5 3.0Facilities and other infrastructure costs8.1 (0.4)Professional services0.2 5.1Executive and other severance— (2.2)Other items2.4 1.1 $79.9 $53.4The increase in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and hiring of research and development personnel. Our research and development expense also increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, due to an increase in facilities and other infrastructure costs to accommodate additional employees. The increase in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, is primarily due to hiring additional employees for our research and development activities, the addition of employees through our fiscal 2012 acquisition, costs associated with design services engineers redeployed to internal research and development projects and higher variable compensation resulting from improved business levels. Our research and development expense also increased during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, due to an increase in professional engineering services costs related to the continuing development of our products and technologies.General and AdministrativeThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Professional services$6.5 $4.2Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs3.0 8.7Stock-based compensation1.1 1.5Net reductions in recoveries of allowance for doubtful accounts(0.3) 6.8Other items(1.1) (2.0) $9.2 $19.2General and administrative expense for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, increased primarily due to an increase in professional services costs resulting from services rendered in connection with our fiscal 2013 acquisitions and an increase in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs resulting from additional employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions.36Table of ContentsWe recorded net recoveries of our allowance for doubtful accounts of $6.6 million during fiscal 2011 because we collected certain receivables that previously had been included in our allowance for doubtful accounts. These recoveries resulted in reductions in our general and administrative expense during fiscal 2011 and, as a result, our general and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2012. We had previously recorded reserves for certain customers based on our assessment of collectibility for those customers. The principal factor for the assessment at that time was a general deterioration of economic conditions having a significant impact on certain customers. These customers' business prospects eventually improved, and we were able to collect the majority of those receivables that had previously been reserved, resulting in recoveries of previously reserved bad debts.Stock-based CompensationStock-based compensation expense is recorded within the various components of our costs and expenses. Stock-based compensation expense increased $18.7 million during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, because of an increase in restricted stock outstanding, higher grant-date fair values and the assumption of certain unvested options related to one of our fiscal 2013 acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense increased $4.0 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, because of an increase in restricted stock outstanding and higher grant date fair values.We expect stock-based compensation to increase during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, because we expect that new awards granted during fiscal 2014 will have higher grant date fair values compared to grants made in previous years and because expenses recorded for awards vesting during fiscal 2014 originate primarily from stock awards granted in recent years, which generally have higher grant date fair values than awards that vested during fiscal 2013. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions, except percentages)Amortization of acquired intangibles$19.4 $15.1 $16.5 $4.3 28% $(1.4) (8)%The changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following: Change 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Increase due to additions of acquired intangibles$7.0 $0.6Decrease due to completed amortization of acquired intangibles(2.7) (2.0) $4.3 $(1.4)We expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, as a result of intangible assets acquired in connection with our fiscal 2013 acquisitions.37Table of ContentsRestructuring and Other ChargesWe have initiated various restructuring plans, with the most recent taking place during fiscal 2013, to better align our resources with our business strategy. For an additional description of these restructuring plans, see Note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management's estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.The following table presents restructuring and other charges (credits) for our restructuring plans:SeveranceandBenefits ExcessFacilities Other Total (In millions)Fiscal 2013$17.6 $0.1 $0.3 $18.0Fiscal 2012— 0.1 — 0.1Fiscal 2011(0.9) 1.3 — 0.4Restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to our restructuring activities initiated during fiscal 2013. Restructuring and other charges (credits) recorded during fiscal 2012 and 2011 consisted primarily of adjustments to previous estimates of restructuring liabilities.Interest Expense 2013 2012 2011 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense: 2011 Notes$— $— $2.02013 Notes2.1 2.1 2.12015 Notes9.2 9.2 9.2Revolving credit facility1.1 — —Amortization of debt discount: 2011 Notes— — 6.82013 Notes6.4 6.3 5.92015 Notes16.0 14.8 13.7Amortization of deferred financing costs: 2011 Notes— — 0.72013 Notes0.4 0.4 0.42015 Notes2.2 1.9 1.9Other0.2 — 0.3Total interest expense$37.6 $34.7 $43.0We expect interest expense to decrease during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to the repayment of our 2013 Notes during December of fiscal 2013.38Table of ContentsIncome TaxesThe following table presents the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions, except percentages)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$(5.2) $(251.7) $23.2Effective tax rate(3.3)% (133.7)% 24.3%Our benefit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 primarily consisted of the following:•Tax benefit of $33.7 million related to the release of an uncertain tax position from a previous business combination and the release of related interest and penalties; and•Tax benefit of $12.8 million for the retroactively enacted fiscal 2012 federal research tax credit and for the fiscal 2013 research tax credit;which were partially offset by:•Federal, state and foreign tax expense on our fiscal 2013 income, and tax expense related to integrating our fiscal 2013 acquisitions.The tax law that retroactively extended the United States federal research tax credit from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013 was enacted in January 2013. Because the law was enacted during our fiscal 2013, we included the tax benefit of the fiscal 2012 federal research tax credit in our fiscal 2013 financial results.Our benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2012 primarily consisted of the following:•Tax benefit from the release of year-end valuation allowance of $219.6 million against our United States deferred tax assets;•Tax benefit of $36.7 million from the effective settlement of the State of California FTB's examination of our tax returns from 2001 through 2003;•Tax benefit from the release of $14.8 million of valuation allowance against our United States deferred tax assets due to the acquisition of intangible assets held by Sigrity during fiscal 2012; which were partially offset by;•Tax expense related to certain of our foreign subsidiaries; and•Excess tax benefit from employee stock compensation that was allocated to equity. Our fiscal 2012 release of the valuation allowance was based on our determination that the magnitude and history of our United States income, our achievement of a consistent multi-year history with approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our bookings being of a type for which revenue is recurring in nature, and our ending backlog of future revenue for the year ended December 29, 2012 provided us an objective source of future revenues that allowed us to more heavily weigh our projections of future income and collectively provided us with sufficient positive evidence that it is more likely than not that we will realize a significant amount of our United States deferred tax assets. We maintained a valuation allowance of $74.3 million on certain of our deferred tax assets because the realization of these deferred tax assets require future income of a specific character or amount that we considered uncertain. Our fiscal 2011 provision for income taxes is primarily related to $11.4 million of tax expense on certain of our foreign subsidiaries, $5.4 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation that were allocated to stockholders' equity, and $4.1 million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits that was partially offset by $5.0 million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities resulting from a fiscal 2011 business combination.The tax law that authorized the United States federal research tax credit expired on December 31, 2013. Unless a new tax law reinstates the federal research tax credit, then we will not include the benefit of the federal research tax credit in our tax provision calculations for fiscal 2014. The fiscal 2013 federal research tax credit was approximately $6.9 million. We expect to have a provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014.For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.39Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 December 31, 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments$633.0 $827.1 $604.6 $(194.1) $222.5Net working capital$72.9 $174.0 $48.6 $(101.1) $125.4Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term InvestmentsAs of December 28, 2013, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $633.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $827.1 million as of December 29, 2012.During fiscal 2013, we used $392.8 million of our cash and cash equivalents for our fiscal 2013 acquisitions. We used an additional $144.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents to pay the remaining balance of the 2013 Notes and the 2023 Notes. These uses of cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by $367.6 million of cash generated from our operating activities, resulted in a decrease in our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance as of December 28, 2013, as compared to December 29, 2012. During fiscal 2013, we used the cash generated from our operating activities and utilized our revolving credit facility to meet our working capital requirements and to maintain adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2013 and 2012 were customer payments for products, maintenance and services, and, during fiscal 2013, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We also received cash from stock purchases under our ESPP and from the exercise of stock options.Our primary uses of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2013 and 2012 were payments relating to our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions, salaries, benefits, other employee-related costs and other operating expenses. During fiscal 2013, we also used cash to pay the remaining balance of the 2013 Notes, the 2023 Notes and for payments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.Approximately 70% of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 28, 2013. Our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations. We do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations. In the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund United States liquidity, we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds. For further discussion regarding our income taxes, including the unrecognized tax liability for indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.During fiscal 2012, we began to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately $100 million in marketable debt securities, including corporate debt securities, United States Treasury securities, United States government agency securities, bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are included in short-term investments as of December 28, 2013. Our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy, which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio. Our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk, interest rate risk and general market risk, as outlined in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors.""During fiscal 2012, we also entered into a $250 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the credit facility may be used to finance working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other business purposes. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are payable on or before December 12, 2017. The credit facility contains customary negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens and make certain investments, asset dispositions and restricted payments. In addition, the credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than 3 to 1, subject to certain exceptions, and requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3 to 1. For an additional description of this revolving credit facility see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.We expect that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases, if any, for at least the next 12 months.40Table of ContentsNet Working CapitalThe changes in net working capital were due to the following: Change 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(190.1) $124.8(Increase) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities(45.3) (5.5)(Increase) decrease in current portion of deferred revenue(4.2) 44.6(Decrease) increase in short-term investments(3.9) 97.7(Decrease) increase in prepaid expenses and other(3.7) 62.8Increase (decrease) in receivables, net9.8 (39.0)Increase (decrease) in inventories14.1 (7.1)Decrease (increase) in convertible notes122.2 (153.0)Other items— 0.1 $(101.1) $125.4The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily due to the timing of payments to our vendors and an increase in accrued salary, benefits and other employee-related costs resulting from employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions. The decrease in convertible notes relates to the payment of our 2013 Notes and 2023 Notes during fiscal 2013.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$367.6 $316.0 $240.3 $51.6 $75.7The changes in cash flows from operating activities were due to the following: Change 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Net income, net of non-cash related gains and losses $(6.6) $138.5Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effect of acquired businesses 58.2 (62.8) $51.6 $75.7Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements.If our customers experience adverse changes in the future, are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they may delay purchasing our products and services, or they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. Our customers' inability to fulfill payment obligations would adversely affect our cash flow. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. Though we have not experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations.We expect to pay an additional $14.2 million related to our previous restructuring activities, primarily for payments related to accrued severance and termination benefits.We expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including our operating results, tax payments and the timing of our billings, collections and disbursements.41Table of ContentsCash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Cash used for investing activities$(426.9) $(201.2) $(56.5) $(225.7) $(144.7)The changes in cash flows from investing activities were due to the following: Change 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired $(326.4) $(22.4)Purchases of property, plant and equipment (9.0) (4.5)Proceeds from the sale of long-term investments 6.2 (9.7)Purchases of available-for-sale securities 9.5 (121.2)Proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities 93.8 12.7Other items 0.2 0.4 $(225.7) $(144.7)Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions relates to our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions. For an additional description of the acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013 and 2012, see Note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2012, we began to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately $100 million in marketable debt securities. The proceeds from, purchases of and maturities of available-for-sale securities are primarily related to normal purchases, sales and maturities of the debt securities included in this investment portfolio.We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making long-term equity investments.42Table of ContentsCash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Cash provided by (used for) financing activities$(116.3) $15.8 $(144.8) $(132.1) $160.6The changes in cash flows from financing activities were due to the following: Change 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In millions)Payment of convertible notes (144.6) 150.0Proceeds from issuance of common stock 10.0 13.0Tax effect related to employee stock transactions allocated to equity 3.0 0.5Principal payments on receivable financing 3.3 0.1Stock received for payment of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock (4.4) (1.5)Other items 0.6 (1.5) $(132.1) $160.6During fiscal 2013, we paid a total of $144.6 million to retire the remaining principal balance of the 2013 Notes and the 2023 Notes. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used for general working capital purposes and were repaid during fiscal 2013. For an additional description of our convertible notes, the conversion terms thereof, and a description of our revolving credit facility see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Cash inflows from the issuance of common stock and the tax effect related to employee stock transactions allocated to equity increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily as a result of an increase in the exercise of stock options. This was partially offset by an increase in cash outflows related to stock received for payment of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock.We expect to repurchase $50.0 million of our common stock during fiscal 2014, and we may repurchase additional shares of our common stock in fiscal 2015. For an additional description of our share repurchase programs and repurchase authorizations, see Part II, Item 5, ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"" and Note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesConvertible NotesAs of December 28, 2013, we had convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of $324.8 million that mature on June 1, 2015. The principal maturity value of our 2015 Notes is $350.0 million. The total cash payable upon the early conversion of these notes, as determined by the indenture of each security, will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be due upon conversion.We will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $7.55 per share. We entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 Notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion. In separate transactions, we sold warrants, or the 2015 Warrants, with a strike price of $10.78 per share. Although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the hedges to the $350.0 million outstanding principal value of the 2015 Notes, we will experience dilution to our stock and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding 2015 Warrants to the extent our average closing stock price exceeds $10.78 in any fiscal quarter until the 2015 Notes are converted and the 2015 Warrants are settled.43Table of ContentsAdditionally, holders may convert their 2015 Notes into cash during any quarter following a quarter in which our stock price closes above $9.81 for at least 20 of the last 30 trading days. The 2015 Notes are convertible into cash from December 29, 2013 through March 29, 2014 because our closing stock price exceeded $9.81 for at least 20 of the last 30 trading days prior to December 28, 2013. Accordingly, the net balance of the 2015 Notes of $324.8 million is classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 28, 2013. While holders of the 2015 Notes would have the right to convert their notes if early conversion conditions are met, we do not expect holders of the 2015 Notes to convert their notes under such circumstances because the economic value to the holders of the notes has exceeded and likely will continue to exceed the cash received upon conversion. If the holders of our 2015 Notes elect to convert their notes into cash, we would be required to make cash payments of up to $350.0 million prior to the maturity of the 2015 Notes. In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the $350.0 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes currently trade at a premium to their if-converted value, and we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 Notes by the note holders between December 29, 2013 and March 29, 2014. We believe that cash generated from our operating activities in future periods as well as access to our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service the maturity or conversion of our 2015 Notes, but future changes in our cash position, cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, cash flows from financing activities, as well as general business levels and changes in our access to financing may impact our ability to settle the principal amount payable to the holders of the 2015 Notes when they mature or convert.For an additional description of the 2015 Notes, the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Acquisition-related contingent considerationIn connection with our business combinations and asset acquisitions completed before December 31, 2011, we may be obligated to make payments based on, or subject to the satisfaction of, certain performance metrics. If performance is such that these payments are fully achieved, we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $14.3 million in cash during the next 28 months.44Table of ContentsContractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 28, 2013 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions)Operating lease obligations$80.4 $22.3 $35.0 $13.5 $9.6Purchase obligations (1)78.2 54.4 18.1 3.7 2.02015 Notes (2)350.0 350.0 — — —Contractual interest payments (2)16.7 9.9 6.1 0.7 —Current income tax payable and unrecognized tax benefits11.1 11.1 — — —Other long-term contractual obligations (3)28.8 — 18.1 1.0 9.7Total$565.2 $447.7 $77.3 $18.9 $21.3_________________(1)With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of December 28, 2013 or the earliest cancellation date.(2)Holders of the 2015 Notes can convert their 2015 Notes into cash during a fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $9.81 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period preceding the end of the preceding fiscal quarter. This conversion condition was met for the 2015 Notes during the three months ended December 28, 2013, and the 2015 Notes are convertible into cash from December 29, 2013 through March 29, 2014. Accordingly, we classified the net balance of the 2015 Notes of $324.8 million as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 28, 2013. Contractual interest payments associated with the 2015 Notes are presented assuming the outstanding balance will be paid in-full on the contractual maturity date. In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the $350.0 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes currently trade at a premium to their if-converted value, so we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 Notes by the note holders between December 29, 2013 and March 29, 2014.(3)Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $11.4 million that we estimate will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisition-related liabilities.In connection with our acquisitions completed before December 28, 2013, we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $14.3 million in cash over the next 28 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 28, 2013, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.New Accounting Standards In June 2013, the FASB issued new accounting standards clarifying the characteristics of investment companies and set forth a new approach for determining whether a company is an investment company. The updated standard requires entities with an ownership interest in an investment company to use the investment company's accounting standards to measure the value of its interest in the investment company. These standards are applicable to our investments currently accounted for using the equity method and will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013; they are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results or financial position.45Table of ContentsIn July 2013, the FASB issued new accounting standards requiring the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except in certain circumstances. When those circumstances exist, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. These standards are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. These standards were to be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date. The adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.We periodically review new accounting standards. Although some of the accounting standards that have been issued may be applicable to us, we have not identified any other new accounting standards that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activity are transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies that can affect our results of operations. In certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, Japan in particular, our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in our revenues, except for our operations in Japan because we receive some cash payments and make most expense payments in Japanese yen.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.46Table of ContentsThe following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of December 28, 2013. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts mature before or during February 2014.

We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, but the fair value of our marketable debt securities and our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents, any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges. Pursuant to our investment policy, we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer, other than in securities issued by the United States Treasury and United States government agencies.Our short-term investments as of December 28, 2013 include $94.7 million of marketable debt securities that may decline in value if market interest rates rise. Such variability in market interest rates may result in a negative impact on the results of our investment activities. As of December 28, 2013, an increase in the market rates of interest of 1% would result in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable debt securities by approximately $0.7 million.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 28, 2013.47Table of ContentsInterest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable, so interest expense for periods when the credit facility is utilized could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Interest rates under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 28, 2013, we had no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. For additional description of this revolving credit facility see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Equity Price RiskConvertible NotesOur 2015 Notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock at conversion or at maturity of the notes. In addition, the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock. The amount of cash we may be required to pay, or the number of shares we may be required to provide to note holders at conversion or maturity of these notes, is determined by the price of our common stock. The amount of cash or number of shares that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock.Upon the expiration of our 2015 Warrants, Cadence will issue shares of common stock to the purchasers of the warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrant strike price of $10.78 at that time. The following table shows the number of shares that Cadence would issue to 2015 Warrant counterparties at expiration of the warrants, assuming various Cadence closing stock prices on the dates of warrant expiration: Shares (In millions)$11.000.9$12.004.7$13.007.9$14.0010.7$15.0013.0$16.0015.1$17.0017.0$18.0018.6$19.0020.1$20.0021.4Prior to the expiration of the 2015 Warrants, for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding will increase when our average closing stock price for a quarter exceeds $10.78.For an additional description of our 2015 Notes, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and ""Liquidity and Capital Resources – Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources,"" under Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.""Equity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments. Our non-marketable investments had a carrying value of $6.7 million as of December 28, 2013, and $7.3 million as of December 29, 2012.48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:47:14.510482
813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe continue to focus on executing our system design enablement, or SDE, strategy to deliver the technologies necessary for integrated system and SoC design with an end product in mind. Our growing core EDA business is at the heart of our SDE strategy and is complemented by our business in IP, system interconnect and analysis, system level design and hardware-software development.Our business serves customers that are driven by end-user demand for electronics systems, ICs and devices that are smaller, use less power and provide more functionality. We offer innovative solutions to help our customers meet these demands.Our future performance depends on our ability to innovate, commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products. We must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. We expect to continue to invest in research and development and customer and partner relationships.We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition, business combinations, intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Accounting for Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.We only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.28Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition We begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: •we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; •delivery has occurred; •the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement; and •collectibility of the fee is probable.Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. For installment contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment, we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. If we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. We have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable, without providing concessions on payments, products or services.Generally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. Key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment, including public information, historical and current financial statements and past collection history. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment. In general, revenue associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license, commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product. In general, product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized up front, upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met, and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. A relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an upfront basis. Our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software, and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software. Consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Revenue from customized IP services is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. If a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement, or MEA, that includes a software contract, revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances, and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations.If a group of contracts is so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such arrangements are deemed to be an MEA. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, an MEA. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an MEA can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts, which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved. For example, a perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an MEA when it is executed within close proximity, or in contemplation of, other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer, in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the MEA instead of up front. 29Table of ContentsFor an MEA that includes software and nonsoftware elements, we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met. In these circumstances, there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows: •Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE;•Third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE; and •Best estimate of the selling price, or BESP. We calculate the BESP of our hardware products based on our pricing practices, including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products, because VSOE or TPE cannot be established. Our process for determining BESP for our software deliverables without VSOE or TPE takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Key external and internal factors considered in developing the BESPs include prices charged by us for similar arrangements, historical pricing practices and the nature of the product. In addition, when developing BESPs, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the BESP of the deliverables in our arrangements.Business CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsOn a quarterly basis, we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities. Inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions.While we believe the observable and unobservable inputs we use to measure the fair value are reasonable, different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations. For an additional description of our fair value measurements, see Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.30Table of ContentsResults of OperationsFinancial results for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013 and 2012, reflect the following:•increased product and maintenance revenue, primarily because of increased business levels, incremental revenue from our acquisitions and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2014;•increased product and maintenance related costs consisting of costs associated with our emulation hardware, which experienced lower margins due to an increasingly competitive environment, and amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles;•increased employee-related costs, primarily consisting of costs related to hiring additional employees, incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions, and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2014;•increased stock-based compensation;•increased amortization of acquired intangibles resulting from acquisitions;•restructuring charges due to restructuring activities during fiscal 2014 and 2013; and•severance and other termination costs primarily associated with a voluntary early retirement program we offered to certain of our employees during fiscal 2014.Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2014 was a 53-week year compared to fiscal 2013 and 2012, which were 52-week years. As noted above, revenue and expenses included in the results of operations for fiscal 2014 were impacted by the additional week. RevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, emulation hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, emulation hardware and IP products in the bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized in a recurring manner over multiple periods or up front, upon completion of delivery. We seek to achieve a consistent revenue mix such that approximately 90% of our revenue is recurring in nature, and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front, upon completion of delivery. Recurring revenue includes revenue from our license arrangements where revenue is recognized over multiple periods, services, royalties from certain IP arrangements, maintenance on perpetual software licenses and emulation hardware, and our operating leases of emulation hardware. Upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation hardware and perpetual software licenses. Our ability to achieve this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by hardware sales. For an additional description of our current product strategy, see the discussion under the heading “Products and Product Strategy” under Part I, Item 1, “Business.” Approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our revenue during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was of a type for which the revenue is recurring in nature. We believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: •competitiveness of our technology; and •size, duration, timing, terms and type of:•contract renewals with existing customers;•additional sales to existing customers; and•sales to new customers.31Table of ContentsRevenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 and the change in revenue between years: Change 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$1,479.2 $1,357.9 $1,212.4 $121.3 9 % $145.5 12 %Services101.8 102.2 114.0 (0.4) — % (11.8) (10)%Total revenue$1,581.0 $1,460.1 $1,326.4 $120.9 8 % $133.7 10 %Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily because of increased business levels, incremental revenue recognized from our acquisitions and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2014. The additional week of operations contributed approximately $15.0 million of revenue to fiscal 2014. Services revenue remained relatively constant during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, but decreased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily because of the redeployment of certain of our design services engineers to internal research and development projects related to our design IP activities. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for, and our resources to fulfill, our services and customized IP offerings.No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.Revenue by Product GroupThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012: 2014 2013 2012Functional Verification, including Emulation Hardware22% 23% 26%Digital IC Design and Signoff29% 30% 32%Custom IC Design27% 27% 26%System Interconnect and Analysis11% 11% 9%IP11% 9% 7%Total100% 100% 100%As described in Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ.

However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese yen. We recognize reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the Japanese yen weakens in value against the United States dollar and additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the Japanese yen strengthens against the United States dollar. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Revenue for Asia increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, primarily due to increases in revenue from our software business and emulation hardware installations. For the primary factors contributing to our increase in revenue in other geographies, excluding Japan, see the general description under “Revenue by Year,” above.Revenue for Japan decreased by approximately $20 million during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the continued depreciation of the Japanese yen as well as difficult business conditions facing our Japanese customers.

Costs associated with our emulation hardware products include materials, assembly, applicable reserves and overhead. These additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of emulation hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products.33Table of ContentsA summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 is as follows: Change 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$119.4 $108.2 $105.0 $11.2 10% $3.2 3%Amortization of acquired intangibles36.9 24.0 13.5 12.9 54% 10.5 78%Total cost of product and maintenance$156.3 $132.2 $118.5 $24.1 18% $13.7 12% Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily upon our emulation hardware product sales and gross margins in any given period. Employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology also impact cost of product and maintenance.The changes in product and maintenance-related costs were due to the following: Change 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions)Emulation hardware costs$10.2 $7.1Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs1.5 (4.5)Other items(0.5) 0.6 $11.2 $3.2Emulation hardware costs increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of incremental reserves on inventory and increased overhead. Emulation hardware costs increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to a higher volume of emulation hardware products sold. Gross margins on our emulation hardware products may fluctuate based on our pricing strategies, product competition and product life cycle. Gross margins on our emulation hardware products decreased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to an increase in compensation, including variable compensation, for existing employees. Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs decreased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to redeployment of certain customer support employees to sales support roles. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. We expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our fiscal 2014 acquisitions. For an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets, see Note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects or on internal development projects. The decrease of $4.6 million in cost of services during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to an overall decrease in services revenue, lower variable compensation and a decrease in the use of third-party contractors.34Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Factors that cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, foreign exchange rates, stock-based compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results.Our employee salary and other compensation-related costs included in marketing and sales and research and development increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to our IP-related research and development activities, sales activities and incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. Our employee salary and other compensation-related costs included in general and administrative decreased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to a decrease in acquisition-related compensation costs. Employee salary and other compensation-related costs included in general and administrative increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions.Stock-based compensation included in operating expenses increased $17.5 million during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and $18.7 million during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily because of higher grant-date fair values of stock awards. During fiscal 2014, we initiated a voluntary early retirement program. The program was offered to certain eligible employees in North America and Japan. We recorded costs associated with this program of approximately $9.7 million in our operating expenses during fiscal 2014. We expect our operating expenses to generally increase during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to expected hiring of additional employees during fiscal 2015 and because fiscal 2015 will include a full year of operating expenses for additional research and development and sales personnel added during fiscal 2014 through hiring and our fiscal 2014 acquisitions. We also expect stock-based compensation included in operating expenses to increase during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to amortization during fiscal 2015 of unrecognized expense related to unvested awards that generally have higher grant-date fair values compared to awards vested in previous years and amortization of new awards granted during fiscal 2015.Many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Our operating expenses for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Change 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$399.7 $378.2 $342.3 $21.5 6 % $35.9 10%Research and development603.0 534.0 454.1 69.0 13 % 79.9 18%General and administrative113.6 121.3 112.1 (7.7) (6)% 9.2 8% $1,116.3 $1,033.5 $908.5 $82.8 8 % $125.0 14%Our operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: 2014 2013 2012Marketing and sales25% 26% 26%Research and development38% 37% 34%General and administrative7% 8% 8%Operating expenses71% 71% 68% 35Table of ContentsMarketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$19.1 $26.0Stock-based compensation4.9 5.4Facilities and other infrastructure costs(1.6) 1.1Professional services(1.8) 2.9Other items0.9 0.5 $21.5 $35.9Research and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$40.1 $57.7Stock-based compensation10.2 11.5Severance and other termination costs, including voluntary early retirement program5.9 —Professional services4.4 0.2Software license and maintenance costs2.4 0.9Depreciation2.0 (0.4)Facilities and other infrastructure costs1.9 8.1Other items2.1 1.9 $69.0 $79.9General and AdministrativeThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$(6.0) $3.0Foreign business tax benefits(4.0) —Change in fair value of contingent consideration(2.3) 0.3Depreciation(1.6) (0.9)Professional services(0.5) 6.2Facilities and other infrastructure costs2.2 (1.0)Software license and maintenance costs2.5 0.3Other items2.0 1.3 $(7.7) $9.236Table of ContentsAmortization of Acquired Intangibles Change 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions, except percentages)Amortization of acquired intangibles$24.0 $19.4 $15.1 $4.6 24% $4.3 28%The changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following: Change 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions)Increase due to additions of acquired intangibles$7.1 $7.0Decrease due to completed amortization of acquired intangibles(2.5) (2.7) $4.6 $4.3Restructuring and Other ChargesWe have initiated various restructuring plans to better align our resources with our business strategy, including a restructuring plan we initiated during fiscal 2014, or the 2014 Restructuring Plan, and a restructuring plan we initiated during fiscal 2013, or the 2013 Restructuring Plan. For an additional description of the 2014 Restructuring Plan and 2013 Restructuring Plan, see Note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.The following table presents restructuring and other charges (credits), net for our restructuring plans:SeveranceandBenefits ExcessFacilities Other Total (In millions)Fiscal 2014$8.0 $(0.9) $3.2 $10.3Fiscal 2013$17.6 $0.1 $0.3 $18.0Fiscal 2012— 0.1 — 0.1Restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits and impairment of certain property, plant and equipment related to the 2014 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to the 2013 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2012 consisted primarily of adjustments to previous estimates of restructuring liabilities. 37Table of ContentsInterest Expense 2014 2013 2012 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense: 2013 Notes— 2.1 2.12015 Notes9.3 9.2 9.22024 Notes3.6 — —Revolving credit facility0.7 1.1 —Amortization of debt discount: 2013 Notes— 6.4 6.32015 Notes17.7 16.0 14.8Amortization of deferred financing costs: 2013 Notes— 0.4 0.42015 Notes2.4 2.2 1.92024 Notes0.1 — —Other0.3 0.2 —Total interest expense$34.1 $37.6 $34.7We expect interest expense to increase during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to interest expense on our 2024 Notes, partially offset by our repayment of the 2015 Notes during fiscal 2015.Income TaxesThe following table presents the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012: 2014 2013 2012 (In millions, except percentages)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$22.1 $(5.2) $(251.7)Effective tax rate12.2% (3.3)% (133.7)%Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015 primarily resulted from federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2014 income. Our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our United States earnings. Our provision for income taxes included the tax benefit of $8.1 million resulting from the enactment of the United States research tax credit in December 2014. Our benefit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 primarily consisted of the following:•tax benefit of $33.7 million related to the release of an uncertain tax position from a previous business combination and the release of related interest and penalties; and•tax benefit of $12.8 million for the retroactively enacted fiscal 2012 federal research tax credit and for the fiscal 2013 research tax credit;which were partially offset by:•federal, state and foreign tax expense on our fiscal 2013 income, and tax expense related to integrating our fiscal 2013 acquisitions.38Table of ContentsOur benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2012 primarily consisted of the following:•tax benefit from the release of year-end valuation allowance of $219.6 million against our United States deferred tax assets;•tax benefit of $36.7 million from the effective settlement of the State of California FTB’s examination of our tax returns from 2001 through 2003;•tax benefit from the release of $14.8 million of valuation allowance against our United States deferred tax assets due to the acquisition of intangible assets held by Sigrity during fiscal 2012; which were partially offset by;•tax expense related to certain of our foreign subsidiaries; and•excess tax benefit from employee stock compensation that was allocated to equity. Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or if we were to repatriate certain foreign earnings on which United States taxes have not been previously accrued.The law that authorized the United States federal research tax credit expired on December 31, 2014. Unless a new law reinstates the federal research tax credit, we will not include the potential benefit of the federal research tax credit in our tax provision calculations for fiscal 2015. We currently expect that our fiscal 2015 effective tax rate will be higher than our fiscal 2014 effective tax rate.For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change January 3, 2015 December 28, 2013 December 29, 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments$1,022.6 $633.0 $827.1 $389.6 $(194.1)Net working capital$458.6 $72.9 $174.0 $385.7 $(101.1)Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term InvestmentsAs of January 3, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1,022.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $633.0 million as of December 28, 2013.Our primary sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2014 were customer payments for our products and services, proceeds from the issuance of our 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024, or the 2024 Notes, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.Our primary uses of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2014 were payments relating to salaries, benefits, other employee-related costs and operating expenses, our fiscal 2014 acquisitions, payments on our revolving credit facility, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, purchases of property, plant and equipment, tax payments and payments related to our recent restructuring plans and voluntary early retirement program.Approximately 45% of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of January 3, 2015. After the repayment of the 2015 Notes during fiscal 2015, the proportion of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries will increase. Our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations. We do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations. In the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund United States liquidity, we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds. For further discussion regarding our income taxes see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.39Table of ContentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of approximately $100 million in marketable debt securities, including corporate debt securities, United States Treasury securities, United States government agency securities, bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are included in short-term investments as of January 3, 2015. Our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy, which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio. Our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk, interest rate risk and general market risk, as outlined in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”We expect that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, cash flows that are generated from operations, proceeds from our 2024 Notes and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including servicing the maturity or conversion of our 2015 Notes, acquisitions, if any, and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.Net Working CapitalNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The increase in our net working capital as of January 3, 2015, as compared to December 28, 2013, is primarily due to higher cash balances resulting from the issuance of our 2024 notes. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Change 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$316.7 $367.6 $316.0 $(50.9) $51.6Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements.The decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers, working capital requirements, payments under our recent restructuring plans, payments for our voluntary early retirement program and an increase in cash paid for taxes, net of tax refunds. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to the timing of collections from customers and disbursements made to vendors.If our customers experience adverse changes in the future, are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they may delay purchasing our products and services, or they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. Our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations would adversely affect our cash flow. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. Though we have not experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations.We expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including our operating results, tax payments and the timing of our billings, collections and disbursements.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Change 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions)Cash used for investing activities$(198.0) $(426.9) $(201.2) $228.9 $(225.7)40Table of ContentsThe decrease in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for business combinations. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for business combinations, offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making long-term equity investments.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Change 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (In millions)Cash provided by (used for) financing activities$289.0 $(116.3) $15.8 $405.3 $(132.1)The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of our 2024 notes, partially offset by payments made for the repurchase of our common stock. The decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to payments made to retire the remaining principal balance of the 2013 Notes and the 2023 Notes. We expect to continue to repurchase our common stock during fiscal 2015. For an additional description of our share repurchase programs and repurchase authorizations, see Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” and Note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources2024 NotesOn October 9, 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually commencing on April 15, 2015. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness.The proceeds from the 2024 Notes are available for general corporate purposes, which may include the retirement of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic transactions. Revolving Credit FacilityOn September 19, 2014, we amended our senior revolving credit facility on terms substantially similar to the prior credit agreement, except that, as amended, our revolving credit facility (i) is unsecured, (ii) expires on September 19, 2019, (iii) has no subsidiary guarantors and (iv) includes certain amendments to the negative and financial covenants, such as modifications to provide additional flexibility, a reduction in Cadence’s basket for secured debt and a decrease in the maximum permitted funded debt to EBIDTA ratio from 3:1 to 2.75:1, subject to certain adjustments. Our revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $250.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $150.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $400.0 million.Convertible NotesAs of January 3, 2015, we had convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of $342.5 million that mature on June 1, 2015. The total cash payable upon the early conversion of these notes, as determined by the indenture of each security, will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be due upon conversion.We will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $7.55 per share. We entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 Notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion. In separate transactions, we sold the 2015 Warrants with a strike price of $10.78 per share. Although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the 2015 Notes Hedges to the outstanding principal value of the 2015 Notes and accrued interest, we will experience dilution to our stock upon settlement of the 2015 Warrants and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding 2015 Warrants to the extent our average closing stock price exceeds $10.78 in any fiscal quarter until the 2015 Warrants are settled.41Table of ContentsAdditionally, holders may elect to convert their 2015 Notes into cash at any time through the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. If the holders of our 2015 Notes elect to convert their notes into cash prior to maturity, we are required to pay the note holders cash equal to the principal amount of the notes converted plus any additional conversion value associated with the conversion feature. We will receive cash from the counterparties to the 2015 Notes Hedges for the value of the conversion feature upon settlement of the notes tendered. As of January 3, 2015, a total of $47.9 million of the 2015 Notes had been tendered for early conversion, of which one thousand dollars principal value had been settled. Subsequent to January 3, 2015, we received notifications for early conversion of an additional $6.0 million principal value of the 2015 Notes, resulting in an aggregate amount of $53.9 million principal value of the 2015 Notes having been tendered for conversion as of February 19, 2015.We expect that cash generated from our operating activities, proceeds from our 2024 Notes, and access to our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service the maturity or conversion of our 2015 Notes. For an additional description of the 2015 Notes, the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of January 3, 2015 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions)Operating lease obligations$69.0 $23.9 $29.8 $12.8 $2.5Purchase obligations (1)47.2 28.1 12.5 6.2 0.42015 Notes (2)350.0 350.0 — — —Long-term debt350.0 — — — 350.0Contractual interest payments (2)160.4 20.7 31.6 31.5 76.6Current income tax payable and unrecognized tax benefits9.1 9.1 — — —Other long-term contractual obligations (3)35.1 — 6.1 20.6 8.4Total$1,020.8 $431.8 $80.0 $71.1 $437.9_________________(1) With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of January 3, 2015 or the earliest cancellation date.(2) Holders of the 2015 Notes may elect to convert their 2015 Notes into cash at any time through the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Contractual interest payments associated with the 2015 Notes are presented assuming the outstanding principal balance will be paid in full on the contractual maturity date. In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the $350.0 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative liability, which represents the cash conversion value of the 2015 Notes, has not been included because Cadence will receive cash in an equal amount from the 2015 Notes Hedges to settle the obligation upon conversion. (3) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $18.5 million that we estimate will be paid or settled within 3 to 5 years. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.In connection with our acquisitions completed before January 3, 2015, we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $10.0 million in cash over the next 15 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of January 3, 2015, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.42Table of ContentsNew Accounting Standards On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under United States generally accepted accounting principles. The updated standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We periodically review new accounting standards. Although some of the accounting standards that have been issued may be applicable to us, we have not identified any other new accounting standards that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activities are transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies that can affect our results of operations. In certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, Japan in particular, our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in our revenues, except for our operations in Japan because we receive some cash payments and make most expense payments in Japanese yen.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.43Table of ContentsThe following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of January 3, 2015. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts mature before or during February 2015. NotionalPrincipal WeightedAverageContractRate (In millions) Forward Contracts: European Union euro$53.9 0.80Japanese yen25.7 119.16Indian rupee25.5 62.88Israeli shekel20.2 3.93Chinese renminbi14.0 6.15Canadian dollar10.4 1.14Taiwan dollar6.7 31.29Other 16.1 N/ATotal$172.5 Estimated fair value$(3.2) While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of marketable debt securities, our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and outstanding balances drawn on our revolving credit facility, if any.We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, but the fair value of our marketable debt securities and our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents, any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges. Pursuant to our investment policy, we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer, other than in securities issued by the United States Treasury and United States government agencies.Our short-term investments as of January 3, 2015 include $88.6 million of marketable debt securities that may decline in value if market interest rates rise. Such variability in market interest rates may result in a negative impact on the results of our investment activities. As of January 3, 2015, an increase in the market rates of interest of 1% would result in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable debt securities by approximately $0.7 million.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of January 3, 2015.Interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable, so interest expense for periods when the credit facility is utilized could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Interest rates under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of January 3, 2015, we had no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. For additional description of this revolving credit facility see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. 44Table of ContentsEquity Price RiskConvertible NotesOur 2015 Notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock during a period following conversion of the notes. In addition, the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock. The amount of cash we may be required to pay at the time converted notes are settled is determined by the price of our common stock. The amount of cash that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock.Upon the expiration of our 2015 Warrants, which will occur on various dates from September 2015 through December 2015, Cadence will issue shares of common stock to the purchasers of the warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrant strike price of $10.78 at that time. The following table shows the number of shares that Cadence would issue to 2015 Warrant counterparties at expiration of the warrants, assuming various Cadence closing stock prices on the dates of warrant expiration: Shares (In millions)$13.007.9$14.0010.7$15.0013.0$16.0015.1$17.0017.0$18.0018.6$19.0020.1$20.0021.4$21.0022.6$22.0023.7Prior to the expiration of the 2015 Warrants, for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding will increase when our average closing stock price for a quarter exceeds $10.78.For an additional description of our 2015 Notes, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources,” under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Equity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments. Our non-marketable investments had a carrying value of $6.1 million as of January 3, 2015, and $6.7 million as of December 28, 2013.45Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:47:01.893094

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe continue to focus on executing our system design enablement, or SDE, strategy to deliver the technologies necessary for integrated system and SoC design with an end product in mind. Our growing core EDA business is at the heart of our SDE strategy and is complemented by our business in IP, system interconnect and analysis, system level design and hardware-software development.Our business serves customers that are driven by end-user demand for electronics systems, ICs and devices that are smaller, use less power and provide more functionality. We offer innovative solutions to help our customers meet these demands.Our future performance depends on our ability to innovate, commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products. We must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. We expect to continue to invest in research and development and customer and partner relationships.We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Results of OperationsFinancial results for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014 and 2013, reflect the following:•increased product and maintenance revenue, primarily because of increased demand for our software, emulation and prototyping hardware, services and IP offerings;•continued investment in research and development and technical customer support;•the effect on our operating expenses of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and•increased stock-based compensation.Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013 were 52-week years, whereas fiscal 2014 was a 53-week year. Revenue and expenses included in the results of operations for fiscal 2014 were impacted by the additional week. RevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized in a recurring manner over multiple periods or up front, upon completion of delivery. We seek to achieve a consistent revenue mix such that approximately 90% of our revenue is recurring in nature, and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front, upon completion of delivery. Recurring revenue includes revenue from our software and IP license arrangements where revenue is recognized over multiple periods, services, royalties from certain IP arrangements, maintenance on perpetual software licenses and hardware, and our operating leases of hardware. Upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and perpetual software and IP licenses. Our ability to achieve this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers. For an additional description of our current product strategy, see the discussion under the heading “Products and Product Strategy” under Part I, Item 1, “Business.” Approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our revenue during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was of a type for which the revenue is recurring in nature.28Table of Contents We believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: •competitiveness of our technology; and •size, duration, timing, terms and type of:◦contract renewals with existing customers;◦additional sales to existing customers; and◦sales to new customers.Revenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the change in revenue between years: Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$1,578.9 $1,479.2 $1,357.9 $99.7 7% $121.3 9 %Services123.2 101.8 102.2 21.4 21% (0.4) — %Total revenue$1,702.1 $1,581.0 $1,460.1 $121.1 8% $120.9 8 %Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased demand for our software, emulation and prototyping hardware, services and IP offerings. Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily because of increased business levels, incremental revenue recognized from our acquisitions and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2014. The additional week of operations contributed approximately $15.0 million of revenue to fiscal 2014. We expect product and maintenance revenue to increase during fiscal 2016 due to increased demand for our new and existing product offerings.Services revenue increased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to increased demand for our service and IP offerings. Services revenue remained relatively constant during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for, and our resources to fulfill, our services and customized IP offerings.No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.Revenue by Product GroupThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013: 2015 2014 2013Functional Verification, including Emulation and Prototyping Hardware23% 22% 23%Digital IC Design and Signoff28% 29% 30%Custom IC Design26% 27% 27%System Interconnect and Analysis11% 11% 11%IP12% 11% 9%Total100% 100% 100%As described in Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. 29Table of ContentsRevenue by Geography Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions, except percentages)United States$782.4 $696.6 $648.7 $85.8 12 % $47.9 7 %Other Americas26.0 23.4 22.9 2.6 11 % 0.5 2 %Asia413.6 360.3 289.1 53.3 15 % 71.2 25 %Europe, Middle East and Africa316.7 328.7 303.6 (12.0) (4)% 25.1 8 %Japan163.4 172.0 195.8 (8.6) (5)% (23.8) (12)%Total revenue$1,702.1 $1,581.0 $1,460.1 $121.1 8 % $120.9 8 %For the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the United States, Other Americas and Asia during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, see the general description under “Revenue by Year” above. Revenue for Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to a reduction of services revenue as we shifted our resources from design services to our IP offerings. Revenue for Japan decreased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the continued depreciation of the Japanese yen as well as difficult business conditions facing our Japanese customers. For the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the United States, Other Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, see the general description under “Revenue by Year” above. Revenue for Asia increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to increases in revenue from our software business and emulation and prototyping hardware installations. Revenue for Japan decreased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen as well as difficult business conditions facing our Japanese customers. Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese yen. We recognize reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the Japanese yen weakens in value against the United States dollar and additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the Japanese yen strengthens against the United States dollar. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue 2015 2014 2013United States46% 44% 44%Other Americas1% 1% 2%Asia24% 23% 20%Europe, Middle East and Africa19% 21% 21%Japan10% 11% 13%Total100% 100% 100%30Table of ContentsCost of Revenue Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$155.7 $156.3 $132.2 $(0.6) — % $24.1 18 %Services82.8 67.4 68.0 15.4 23 % (0.6) (1)%Total cost of revenue$238.5 $223.7 $200.2 $14.8 7 % $23.5 12 %The following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013: 2015 2014 2013Product and maintenance10% 11% 10%Services67% 66% 67%Cost of Product and MaintenanceCost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and IP products, certain employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, cost of our customer support services, amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles, as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include materials, assembly, applicable reserves and overhead. These hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products.A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows: Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$115.2 $119.4 $108.2 $(4.2) (4)% $11.2 10%Amortization of acquired intangibles40.5 36.9 24.0 3.6 10 % 12.9 54%Total cost of product and maintenance$155.7 $156.3 $132.2 $(0.6) — % $24.1 18%Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily upon our hardware product sales in any given period. Cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology.The changes in product and maintenance-related costs were due to the following: Change 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions)Emulation and prototyping hardware costs$(5.1) $10.2Other items0.9 1.0 $(4.2) $11.2Emulation and prototyping hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, and increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily because charges for inventory reserves were higher during fiscal 2014. Gross margins on our hardware products may fluctuate based on customer pricing strategies, product competition and product life cycle. 31Table of ContentsAmortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, and during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. For an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets, see Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects or on internal development projects. Cost of services increased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to an overall increase in services revenue and in the resources required to meet the demand for our services and IP offerings. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Factors that cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, foreign exchange rates, stock-based compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results.Many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. During fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, we experienced a favorable impact on expenses as a result of the strengthening value of the United States dollar against other currencies, including the European Union euro and the Japanese yen. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Our employee salary and other compensation-related costs included in marketing and sales and research and development increased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to incremental investments in technical customer support and research and development, partially offset by the strengthening value of the United States dollar against other currencies. Our employee salary and other compensation-related costs included in marketing and sales and research and development increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. We expect employee salary and other compensation-related costs included in marketing and sales and research and development to increase during fiscal 2016 due to continued investments in technical customer support and research and development.Stock-based compensation included in operating expenses increased $8.1 million during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, and $15.9 million during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily because of higher grant-date fair values of stock awards vesting during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. We expect stock-based compensation included in operating expenses to increase during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, due to amortization during fiscal 2016 of unrecognized expense related to unvested awards with generally higher grant-date fair values compared to awards that vested in previous years and amortization from new awards expected to be granted during fiscal 2016.Our operating expenses for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$402.4 $399.7 $378.2 $2.7 1 % $21.5 6 %Research and development637.6 603.0 534.0 34.6 6 % 69.0 13 %General and administrative110.0 113.6 121.3 (3.6) (3)% (7.7) (6)% $1,150.0 $1,116.3 $1,033.5 $33.7 3 % $82.8 8 %32Table of ContentsOur operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: 2015 2014 2013Marketing and sales24% 25% 26%Research and development37% 38% 37%General and administrative6% 7% 8%Operating expenses68% 71% 71% Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$0.9 $19.1Stock-based compensation1.1 4.9Other items0.7 (2.5) $2.7 $21.5Research and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions)Materials and other pre-production costs$10.0 $(0.4)Facilities and other infrastructure costs8.9 1.9Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs6.6 40.1Stock-based compensation6.6 10.2Software license and maintenance costs5.4 2.4Professional services2.4 4.8Severance and other termination costs (5.9) 5.9Other items0.6 4.1 $34.6 $69.0General and AdministrativeThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions)Professional services$(5.5) $(0.5)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs(0.6) (6.0)Other items2.5 (1.2) $(3.6) $(7.7)33Table of ContentsAmortization of Acquired Intangibles Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions, except percentages)Amortization of acquired intangibles$23.7 $24.0 $19.4 $(0.3) (1)% $4.6 24%The changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following: Change 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions)Increase due to additions of acquired intangibles$0.7 $7.1Decrease due to completed amortization of acquired intangibles(1.0) (2.5) $(0.3) $4.6Restructuring and Other ChargesWe have initiated various restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.The following table presents restructuring and other charges (credits), net for our restructuring plans:SeveranceandBenefits ExcessFacilities Other Total (In millions)Fiscal 2015$3.6 $1.1 $(0.2) $4.5Fiscal 2014$8.0 $(0.9) $3.2 $10.3Fiscal 2013$17.6 $0.1 $0.3 $18.0For an additional description of our restructuring plans, see Note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.34Table of ContentsInterest Expense 2015 2014 2013 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense: 2013 Notes— — 2.12015 Notes3.0 9.3 9.22024 Notes15.3 3.6 —Revolving credit facility0.5 0.7 1.1Amortization of debt discount: 2013 Notes— — 6.42015 Notes7.5 17.7 16.02024 Notes0.1 — —Amortization of deferred financing costs: 2013 Notes— — 0.42015 Notes1.0 2.4 2.22024 Notes0.5 0.1 —Other0.4 0.3 0.2Total interest expense$28.3 $34.1 $37.6During fiscal 2015, we settled the outstanding principal balance of our 2015 Notes.Income TaxesThe following table presents the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013: 2015 2014 2013 (In millions, except percentages)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$15.2 $22.1 $(5.2)Effective tax rate5.7% 12.2% (3.3)%Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2015 income, which was partially offset by $13.8 million of tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax examination of a foreign subsidiary. Our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of $10.1 million resulting from the enactment of the United States research tax credit in December 2015. Our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our United States earnings. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015 primarily resulted from federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2014 income. Our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our United States earnings. Our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of $8.1 million resulting from the enactment of the United States research tax credit in December 2014. Our benefit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 primarily consisted of the following:•tax benefit of $33.7 million related to the release of an uncertain tax position from a previous business combination and the release of related interest and penalties; and•tax benefit of $12.8 million for the retroactively enacted fiscal 2012 federal research tax credit and for the fiscal 2013 research tax credit;which were partially offset by:•federal, state and foreign tax expense on our fiscal 2013 income, and tax expense related to integrating our fiscal 2013 acquisitions.35Table of ContentsOur future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or if we were to repatriate certain foreign earnings on which United States taxes have not been previously accrued. We currently expect that our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate will be higher than our fiscal 2015 effective tax rate. For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change January 2, 2016 January 3, 2015 December 28, 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments$711.2 $1,022.6 $633.0 $(311.4) $389.6Net working capital$428.5 $458.6 $72.9 $(30.1) $385.7Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term InvestmentsAs of January 2, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $711.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $1,022.6 million as of January 3, 2015.Our primary sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2015 were proceeds from convertible notes hedges, cash generated from operations, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.Our primary uses of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2015 were payments related to salaries and benefits, other employee-related costs and operating expenses, payments related to our 2015 Notes, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of property, plant and equipment, tax payments and interest payments. The 2015 Notes matured on June 1, 2015, at which time we paid net cash of $353.8 million of outstanding principal balance and accrued interest to holders of the 2015 Notes upon conversion or maturity. Approximately 61% of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of January 2, 2016. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations. We do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are indefinitely reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations. In the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently indefinitely reinvested are needed to fund United States liquidity, we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds. For further discussion regarding our income taxes see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.We maintain an investment portfolio of approximately $100 million in marketable debt securities, including corporate debt securities, United States Treasury securities, United States government agency securities, bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are included in short-term investments as of January 2, 2016. Our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy, which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio. Our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk, interest rate risk and general market risk, as outlined in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”We expect that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, cash flows that are generated from operations, proceeds from additional domestic borrowings and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions, if any, and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.36Table of ContentsNet Working CapitalNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in our net working capital as of January 2, 2016, as compared to January 3, 2015, is primarily due the reclassification of our current deferred tax assets to long term on the balance sheet as the result of the adoption of a new accounting standard intended to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, partially offset by an increase in receivables, net and prepaid expenses and other current assets. For additional information relating to the impact of new accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$378.2 $316.7 $367.6 $61.5 $(50.9)Cash flows provided by operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements.The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to improved profitability and the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers, working capital requirements, payments under our recent restructuring plans, payments for our voluntary early retirement program and an increase in cash paid for taxes, net of tax refunds. We expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including our operating results, tax payments and the timing of our billings, collections and disbursements.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions)Cash used for investing activities$(44.5) $(198.0) $(426.9) $153.5 $228.9The decrease in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, and during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for business combinations because we did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal 2015 and paid less for acquired businesses in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, and purchasing software licenses.37Table of ContentsCash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows provided by (used for) financing activities during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In millions)Cash provided by (used for) financing activities$(626.3) $289.0 $(116.3) $(915.3) $405.3The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to payments made to settle the principal value of the 2015 Notes and an increase in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of our 2024 notes, partially offset by payments made for the repurchase of our common stock. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Repurchase ProgramAs of January 2, 2016, we had approximately $960 million remaining under our authorized stock repurchase program. We expect to execute this program through the end of fiscal 2016. The actual timing and amount of repurchases will be subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, acquisition opportunities and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and will be funded by U.S. cash on hand, future U.S. cash flow and additional debt. For an additional description of our share repurchase programs and repurchase authorizations, see Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”2019 Term LoanOn January 28, 2016, Cadence entered into a $300.0 million three-year senior unsecured non-amortizing term loan facility, or the 2019 Term Loan, with a group of lenders led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2019 Term Loan is unsecured, and the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our common stock. For additional information relating the 2019 Term Loan, see Note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.2024 NotesIn October 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. The proceeds from the 2024 Notes are available for general corporate purposes, which may include the retirement of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic transactions.Revolving Credit FacilityWe maintain a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The credit facility provides for borrowings up to $250.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $150.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $400.0 million. The credit facility, as amended, expires on September 19, 2019 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on September 19, 2019. Outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. 38Table of ContentsContractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of January 2, 2016 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions)Operating lease obligations$54.3 $21.0 $21.9 $8.8 $2.6Purchase obligations (1)48.2 34.4 11.8 2.0 —Long-term debt350.0 — — — 350.0Contractual interest payments139.7 15.8 31.6 31.0 61.3Current income tax payable11.0 11.0 — — —Other long-term contractual obligations (2)24.8 — 3.2 12.3 9.3Total$628.0 $82.2 $68.5 $54.1 $423.2_________________(1) With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, this table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of January 2, 2016 or the earliest cancellation date.(2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $11.1 million that we estimate will be paid or settled within 3 to 5 years. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of January 2, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition, business combinations, intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Accounting for Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.39Table of ContentsWe only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition We begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: •we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; •delivery has occurred; •the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement; and •collectibility of the fee is probable.Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. For installment contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment, we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. If we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. We have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable, without providing concessions on payments, products or services.Generally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. Key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment, including public information, historical and current financial statements and past collection history. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment. Revenue associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license, commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product. In general, product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, exists for the undelivered maintenance, is recognized up front, upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met, and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. If certain other criteria are met, revenue for design IP is recognized upon delivery and we accrue the expected costs of maintenance. A relatively small percentage of our revenue from software and IP licenses is recognized on an upfront basis. Our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software, and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software. Consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 40Table of ContentsRevenue from services and customized IP arrangements is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. If a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement, or MEA, that includes a software contract, revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances, and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations.If a group of contracts is so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such arrangements are deemed to be an MEA. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, an MEA. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an MEA can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts, which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved. For example, a perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an MEA when it is executed within close proximity, or in contemplation of, other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer, in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the MEA instead of up front. For an MEA that includes software and nonsoftware elements, we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met. In these circumstances, there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows: •Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE;•Third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE; and •Best estimate of the selling price, or BESP. We calculate the BESP of our hardware products based on our pricing practices, including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products, because VSOE or TPE cannot be established. Our process for determining BESP for our software deliverables without VSOE or TPE takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Key external and internal factors considered in developing the BESPs include prices charged by us for similar arrangements, historical pricing practices and the nature of the product. In addition, when developing BESPs, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the BESP of the deliverables in our arrangements.Business CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.41Table of ContentsFair Value of Financial InstrumentsOn a quarterly basis, we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities. Inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions.While we believe the observable and unobservable inputs we use to measure the fair value are reasonable, different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations. For an additional description of our fair value measurements, see Note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.New Accounting Standards For information regarding new accounting standards applicable to us, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “New Accounting Standards.”42Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activities are transacted in the U.S. dollar. In certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in U.S. dollars, a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets.In certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency, Japan in particular, our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts, except for our operations in Japan because we receive some cash payments and make most expense payments in Japanese yen.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of January 2, 2016. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts mature before or during February 2016.

In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents, any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges. Pursuant to our investment policy, we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer, other than in securities issued by the United States Treasury and United States government agencies.Our short-term investments as of January 2, 2016 include $92.3 million of marketable debt securities that may decline in value if market interest rates rise. Such variability in market interest rates may result in a negative impact on the results of our investment activities. As of January 2, 2016, an increase in the market rates of interest of 1% would result in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable debt securities by approximately $0.8 million.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of January 2, 2016.Interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable, so interest expense for periods when the credit facility is utilized could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Interest rates under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of January 2, 2016, we had no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. For additional description of this revolving credit facility see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Equity Price RiskEquity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments. Our non-marketable investments had a carrying value of $3.9 million as of January 2, 2016, and $6.1 million as of January 3, 2015.44Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:47:09.967147

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe continue to focus on executing our system design enablement strategy to deliver the tools necessary for our customers to develop complete and functional electronic products. Our growing core electronic design automation business is at the heart of our strategy and is complemented by our business in intellectual property, system interconnect and analysis, system level design and hardware-software development.Our business serves customers that are driven by end-user demand for electronics systems, integrated circuits and devices that are smaller, use less power and provide more functionality. We must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. We offer innovative solutions to help our customers meet these demands and our future performance depends on our ability to innovate, commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Results of OperationsFinancial results for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 and 2014, reflect the following:•increased product and maintenance revenue, primarily because of increased demand for our emulation and prototyping hardware and digital IC product offerings;•continued investment in research and development activities focused on creating and enhancing our products to maintain the pace of innovation required by our customers;•increased stock-based compensation included in operating expenses; and•restructuring activities.Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were 52-week years, whereas fiscal 2014 was a 53-week year. Revenue and expenses included in the results of operations for fiscal 2014 were impacted by the additional week. RevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized in a recurring manner over multiple periods or up front, upon completion of delivery. Approximately 90% of our revenue is recurring in nature, and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front, upon completion of delivery. Recurring revenue includes revenue from our time-based software arrangements, certain IP license arrangements where revenue is recognized over multiple periods, services, royalties from certain IP arrangements, maintenance on perpetual software licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. Upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and perpetual software and certain IP licenses. Our ability to maintain this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers. For an additional description of the impact of emulation hardware sales on the timing of revenue recognition, see the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates – Revenue Recognition.” 28Table of Contents We believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: •competitiveness of our technology; and •size, duration, timing, terms and type of:◦contract renewals with existing customers;◦additional sales to existing customers; and◦sales to new customers.Revenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 and the change in revenue between years: Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$1,683.8 $1,578.9 $1,479.2 $104.9 7% $99.7 7%Services132.3 123.2 101.8 9.1 7% 21.4 21%Total revenue$1,816.1 $1,702.1 $1,581.0 $114.0 7% $121.1 8%Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily because of an increase in revenue from our Palladium Z1 enterprise emulation system and our digital IC product offerings, offset by a reduction in revenue from our IP offerings. Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to increased demand for our software, emulation and prototyping hardware and IP offerings. Services revenue increased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the timing of incremental revenue from certain customer agreements that was recognized at the completion of the contract when all specified deliverables were made available. Services revenue increased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to increased demand for our service and IP offerings. Total revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for, and our resources to fulfill, our services, emulation hardware and IP offerings.No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.Revenue by Product GroupThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014: 2016 2015 2014Functional Verification, including Emulation and Prototyping Hardware25% 23% 22%Digital IC Design and Signoff29% 28% 29%Custom IC Design25% 26% 27%System Interconnect and Analysis10% 11% 11%IP11% 12% 11%Total100% 100% 100%As described in Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. 29Table of ContentsRevenue by Geography Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions, except percentages)United States$832.6 $782.4 $696.6 $50.2 6 % $85.8 12 %Other Americas31.3 26.0 23.4 5.3 20 % 2.6 11 %Asia445.5 413.6 360.3 31.9 8 % 53.3 15 %Europe, Middle East and Africa346.7 316.7 328.7 30.0 9 % (12.0) (4)%Japan160.0 163.4 172.0 (3.4) (2)% (8.6) (5)%Total revenue$1,816.1 $1,702.1 $1,581.0 $114.0 7 % $121.1 8 %For the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the United States, Other Americas, Asia, and Europe, Middle East and Africa during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, see the general description under “Revenue by Year” above.

Revenue for Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to a reduction of services revenue as we shifted our resources from design services to our IP offerings. Revenue for Japan decreased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the continued depreciation of the Japanese yen as well as difficult business conditions facing our Japanese customers. Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies.

Costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include materials, assembly, applicable reserves and overhead. These hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products.A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows: Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$140.9 $115.2 $119.4 $25.7 22% $(4.2) (4)%Amortization of acquired intangibles42.4 40.5 36.9 1.9 5% 3.6 10 %Total cost of product and maintenance$183.3 $155.7 $156.3 $27.6 18% $(0.6) — %Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period. Cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology.31Table of ContentsThe changes in product and maintenance-related costs were due to the following: Change 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions)Emulation and prototyping hardware costs$28.0 $(5.1)Other items(2.3) 0.9 $25.7 $(4.2)Emulation and prototyping hardware costs increased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher emulation hardware volume and an increase in charges for reserves on inventory during fiscal 2016 as we approach the end of the product life cycle of Palladium XP, a previous generation of our Palladium hardware platform. Emulation and prototyping hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily because charges for inventory reserves were higher during fiscal 2014. Gross margins on our hardware products will fluctuate based on customer pricing strategies, product mix, product competition and product life cycle.Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2016 acquisitions. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2014 acquisitions. For an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets, see Note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects or on internal development projects. Cost of services decreased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and increased during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to variation in the number of personnel dedicated to deliver and support our services and custom IP offerings. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Factors that cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, restructuring activities, foreign exchange rates, stock-based compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results.Many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. During fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, we experienced a favorable impact on expenses as a result of the strengthening value of the United States dollar against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Our operating expenses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$395.2 $402.4 $399.7 $(7.2) (2)% $2.7 1 %Research and development735.3 637.6 603.0 97.7 15 % 34.6 6 %General and administrative125.1 110.0 113.6 15.1 14 % (3.6) (3)% $1,255.6 $1,150.0 $1,116.3 $105.6 9 % $33.7 3 %32Table of ContentsOur operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: 2016 2015 2014Marketing and sales22% 24% 26%Research and development40% 38% 38%General and administrative7% 6% 7%Operating expenses69% 68% 71% Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$(6.3) $0.9Professional services(2.7) 2.8Other items1.8 (1.0) $(7.2) $2.7Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs decreased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to headcount reductions within our sales organization.

Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.34Table of ContentsThe following table presents restructuring and other charges (credits), net for our restructuring plans:SeveranceandBenefits ExcessFacilities Other Total (In millions)Fiscal 2016$40.4 $0.6 $— $41.0Fiscal 2015$3.6 $1.1 $(0.2) $4.5Fiscal 2014$8.0 $(0.9) $3.2 $10.3For an additional description of our restructuring plans, see Note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of the following: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense: 2015 Notes$— $3.0 $9.32019 Term Loan5.6 — —2024 Notes15.3 15.3 3.6Revolving credit facility1.6 0.5 0.7Amortization of debt discount: 2015 Notes— 7.5 17.72024 Notes0.1 0.1 —Amortization of deferred financing costs: 2015 Notes— 1.0 2.42019 Term Loan0.2 — —2024 Notes0.5 0.5 0.1Other0.4 0.4 0.3Total interest expense$23.7 $28.3 $34.1For an additional description of our debt arrangements, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Provision for income taxes$34.1 $15.2 $22.1Effective tax rate14.4% 5.7% 12.2%During fiscal 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for stock-based compensation that requires all income tax effects of stock-based awards to be recognized in our consolidated income statement as the awards vest or are settled. For further discussion regarding new accounting standards, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards.”Our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our United States earnings. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2016 income and includes the tax benefit resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the United States research tax credit in December 2015. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 includes $17.2 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or settled during the period. 35Table of ContentsOur provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2015 income, which was partially offset by $13.8 million of tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax examination of a foreign subsidiary. Our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of $10.1 million resulting from the enactment of the United States research tax credit in December 2015. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015 primarily resulted from federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2014 income. Our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of $8.1 million resulting from the enactment of the United States research tax credit in December 2014. Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or if we were to repatriate certain foreign earnings on which United States taxes have not been previously accrued. We currently expect that our fiscal 2017 effective tax rate will be similar to our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate. For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change December 31, 2016 January 2, 2016 January 3, 2015 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments$468.3 $711.2 $1,022.6 $(242.9) $(311.4)Net working capital$116.5 $427.9 $458.6 $(311.4) $(30.7)Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term InvestmentsAs of December 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $468.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $711.2 million as of January 2, 2016.Our primary sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2016 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings, proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.Our primary uses of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2016 were payments related to salaries and benefits, repurchases of our common stock, other employee-related costs and operating expenses, payments on our revolving credit facility, purchases of property, plant and equipment, acquisitions, and tax payments. Approximately 63% of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations. We do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are indefinitely reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations. In the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently indefinitely reinvested are needed to fund United States liquidity, we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds. For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.We expect that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.Net Working CapitalNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in our net working capital as of December 31, 2016, as compared to January 2, 2016, is primarily due to a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments resulting from financing activities, including repurchases of our common stock.36Table of ContentsCash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$444.9 $378.2 $316.7 $66.7 $61.5Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements.The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to improved profitability and the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors. We expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including our operating results, the timing of our billings, collections, disbursements and tax payments.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows provided by (used for) investing activities during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions)Cash provided by (used for) investing activities$1.4 $(44.5) $(198.0) $45.9 $153.5The increase in cash flows provided by investing activities during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to an increase in proceeds resulting from the sale and maturity of our available-for-sale securities, partially offset by an increase in cash used for business combinations and asset acquisitions. The decrease in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for business combinations because we did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal 2015. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making long-term equity investments.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows provided by (used for) financing activities during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (In millions)Cash provided by (used for) financing activities$(592.7) $(626.3) $289.0 $33.6 $(915.3)The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to proceeds from the 2019 Term Loan and our revolving credit facility and a decrease in payments made to settle outstanding borrowings, offset by an increase in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock. The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to payments made to settle the principal value of the 2015 Notes and an increase in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock.On January 28, 2016, we entered into a $300.0 million three-year senior unsecured non-amortizing term loan facility due on January 28, 2019, or the 2019 Term Loan, with a group of lenders led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2019 Term Loan is unsecured. For additional information relating to the 2019 Term Loan, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.37Table of ContentsOur revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, provided for borrowings up to $250.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $150.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $400.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $50.0 million. This revolving credit facility was replaced by a new revolving credit facility on January 30, 2017, as described below.Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources2024 NotesIn October 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. The proceeds from the 2024 Notes are available for general corporate purposes, which may include the retirement of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic transactions.Revolving Credit FacilityOn January 30, 2017, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, which replaced our existing revolving credit facility. The new credit facility provides for borrowings up to $350.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million. The credit facility expires on January 28, 2022 and has no subsidiary guarantors. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on January 28, 2022. Outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. For additional information relating to our new revolving credit facility, see Note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions)Operating lease obligations$91.0 $20.7 $31.6 $16.5 $22.2Purchase obligations (1)30.4 19.2 9.6 0.8 0.8Long-term debt650.0 — 300.0 — 350.0Contractual interest payments142.6 24.0 42.1 30.6 45.9Current income tax payable18.4 18.4 — — —Other long-term contractual obligations (2)27.5 — 10.4 7.9 9.2Total$959.9 $82.3 $393.7 $55.8 $428.1_________________(1) With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, this table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of December 31, 2016 or the earliest cancellation date.(2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $14.4 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. Of the $14.4 million,we estimate $7.6 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years and $6.8 million within 3 to 5 years. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.38Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition, business combinations, intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Accounting for Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.We only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition We begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: •we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; •delivery has occurred; •the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement; and •collectibility of the fee is probable.Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. For contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment, we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. If we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on time-based licenses, revenue from such licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a time-based arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. We have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable, without providing concessions on payments, products or services.39Table of ContentsGenerally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. Key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment, including public information, historical and current financial statements and past collection history. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment. Revenue associated with our time-based licenses is recognized on a recurring basis over the term of the arrangement, commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product. In general, product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, exists for the undelivered maintenance, is recognized up front, upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met, and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. If certain other criteria are met, revenue for design IP is recognized upon delivery and we accrue the expected costs of maintenance. A relatively small percentage of our revenue from software and IP licenses is recognized on an upfront basis. Our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software, and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software. Consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Revenue from services and customized IP arrangements is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. If a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement, or MEA, that includes a software contract, revenue is generally recognized on a recurring basis over the duration of the software contract. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances, and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations.If a group of contracts is so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such arrangements are deemed to be an MEA. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, an MEA. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an MEA can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts, which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved. For example, a perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an MEA when it is executed within close proximity, or in contemplation of, other license agreements that require recurring revenue recognition with the same customer, in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the MEA instead of up front. For an MEA that includes software and nonsoftware elements, we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met. In these circumstances, there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows: •Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE;•Third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE; and •Best estimate of the selling price, or BESP. We calculate the BESP of our hardware products based on our pricing practices, including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products, because VSOE or TPE cannot be established. Our process for determining BESP for our software deliverables without VSOE or TPE takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Key external and internal factors considered in developing the BESPs include prices charged by us for similar arrangements, historical pricing practices and the nature of the product. In addition, when developing BESPs, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the BESP of the deliverables in our arrangements.40Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsOn a quarterly basis, we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities. Inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions.While we believe the observable and unobservable inputs we use to measure the fair value are reasonable, different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations. For an additional description of our fair value measurements, see Note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.New Accounting Standards Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. The new standard will be effective for us beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). While we continue to assess all potential impacts of the standard, our preliminary assessment is that we expect to continue to recognize revenue for our time-based software arrangements over time, which represents a significant percentage of our total revenue. This preliminary assessment is based on the conclusion that the multiple software licenses and related updates in our time-based arrangements constitute a single, combined performance obligation. The timing of revenue recognition for our hardware and professional services is expected to remain substantially unchanged. 41Table of ContentsWe currently believe the most significant impact of the adoption of this new standard relates to our accounting for multiple element arrangements, or MEAs, that combine many software-related deliverables, which may include multiple software contracts with varying terms, IP licenses, and/or service elements.Using the current accounting guidance that requires vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, to recognize revenue separately for the different software elements, the revenue related to these MEAs is generally recognized over time beginning with the delivery of the last specified deliverable and ending on the latest end date. For example, under the current accounting guidance, an MEA that included a perpetual IP license (delivered at contract execution) with 12 months of maintenance and a 36-month time-based software contract would all be recognized over the 36-month term of the software contract. Under the new standard, amounts will be allocated to each of the performance obligations and the related revenue will be recognized as each performance obligation is fulfilled. In the example above, an amount would be allocated to the IP, the maintenance and the time-based software contract, and those respective revenue amounts would be recognized upon delivery of the IP, over the 12-month maintenance term and over the 36-month time-based software term. The allocation of revenue for each performance obligation noted above is determined based on the standalone selling price, or SSP, of each performance obligation. More judgment and estimates will be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under current GAAP, including estimating the SSP for each performance obligation identified within our contracts. We are currently performing analyses to determine the SSP for each of the performance obligations that have been identified. In addition, we are currently implementing systems and processes to assist in the adoption of this new accounting standard. We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the cumulative catch-up transition method.Financial InstrumentsIn January 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that will impact certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring, among other things, the recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet by lessees for certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard. The updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted, and requires the use of a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets and may require changes to our systems and processes. We have not yet made any decision on the timing of adoption.Income TaxIn October 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that will amend the accounting for income taxes on intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer when the transfer occurs. For intra-entity transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.Business CombinationsIn January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that revises the definition of a business as it relates to acquisitions, disposals, goodwill impairments and consolidations. The updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of adopting the new standard.Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that simplifies the required test of goodwill for impairment by eliminating “Step 2” from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance is required to be applied on a prospective basis. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.For information regarding new accounting standards adopted during fiscal 2016, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards.”42Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activities are transacted in the U.S. dollar. In certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in U.S. dollars, a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets.In certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of December 31, 2016. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts mature before or during February 2017.

In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents, any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges. Pursuant to our investment policy, we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer, other than in securities issued by the United States Treasury and United States government agencies.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 31, 2016.Interest rates under our revolving credit facility and 2019 Term Loan are variable, so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when we maintain an outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility. Interest rates for our revolving credit facility and 2019 Term Loan can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2016, we had a $50.0 million outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. For additional description of this revolving credit facility see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Equity Price RiskEquity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments. Our non-marketable investments had a carrying value of $3.2 million as of December 31, 2016, and $3.9 million as of January 2, 2016.",2023-12-30 20:47:05.204833
813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe continue to focus on executing our system design enablement strategy to deliver the tools necessary for our customers to develop complete and functional electronic products. Our growing core electronic design automation business is at the heart of our strategy and is complemented by our business in intellectual property, system interconnect and analysis, system level design and hardware-software development.Our business serves customers that are driven by end-user demand for electronics systems, integrated circuits and devices that are smaller, use less power and provide more functionality. We must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. We offer innovative solutions to help our customers meet these demands and our future performance depends on our ability to innovate, commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products. Our acquisitions may increase the speed at which we can deliver innovative solutions to our customers. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Results of OperationsFinancial results for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016 and 2015, reflect the following:•increased product and maintenance revenue resulting from overall growth in our software and IP business, particularly in Asia and Europe;•continued investment in research and development activities focused on creating and enhancing our products to maintain the pace of innovation required by our customers; and•provisional tax effects from the enactment of the Tax Act.Our fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were each 52-week fiscal years.RevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over multiple periods or up front, upon completion of delivery. Our revenue may also be affected by our ability to bring to market newly developed or acquired technology. During fiscal 2017, we acquired technology that is not expected to generate significant incremental revenue during fiscal 2018. For an additional description of our acquisitions, see Note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Approximately 90% of our revenue is recognized over time, and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front, upon completion of delivery. Revenue recognized over time includes revenue from our time-based software arrangements, certain IP license arrangements where revenue is recognized over multiple periods, services, royalties from certain IP arrangements, maintenance on perpetual software licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. Upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and perpetual software and certain IP licenses. Our ability to maintain this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers. For an additional description of the impact of emulation hardware sales on the timing of revenue recognition, see the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates – Revenue Recognition.” Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we will recognize revenue based on the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” Under the new standard, we will continue to recognize revenue over time for our software arrangements, and the timing of revenue recognition for our hardware and professional services is expected to remain substantially unchanged. For additional information on the impact the new accounting standard will have on our revenue, see the discussion under the heading “New Accounting Standards.” 29Table of Contents We believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: •competitiveness of our technology; and •size, duration, timing, terms and type of:◦contract renewals with existing customers;◦additional sales to existing customers; and◦sales to new customers.Revenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the change in revenue between years: Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$1,814.0 $1,683.8 $1,578.9 $130.2 8 % $104.9 7%Services129.0 132.3 123.2 (3.3) (2)% 9.1 7%Total revenue$1,943.0 $1,816.1 $1,702.1 $126.9 7 % $114.0 7%Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily because of growth in our software and IP businesses, partially offset by lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware. Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily because of an increase in revenue from our Palladium Z1 enterprise emulation system and our digital IC product offerings, offset by a reduction in revenue from our IP offerings. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for, and our available resources to fulfill, our services and IP offerings.No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.Revenue by Product GroupThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015: 2017 2016 2015Functional Verification, including Emulation and Prototyping Hardware22% 25% 23%Digital IC Design and Signoff29% 29% 28%Custom IC Design27% 25% 26%System Interconnect and Analysis10% 10% 11%IP12% 11% 12%Total100% 100% 100%Revenue by product group fluctuates from period to period based on demand for, and our available resources to deliver and support our products and services. As described in Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. 30Table of Contents Revenue by Geography Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions, except percentages)United States$829.4 $832.6 $782.4 $(3.2) — % $50.2 6 %Other Americas35.1 31.3 26.0 3.8 12 % 5.3 20 %Asia526.2 445.5 413.6 80.7 18 % 31.9 8 %Europe, Middle East and Africa385.7 346.7 316.7 39.0 11 % 30.0 9 %Japan166.6 160.0 163.4 6.6 4 % (3.4) (2)%Total revenue$1,943.0 $1,816.1 $1,702.1 $126.9 7 % $114.0 7 %Revenue for the United States decreased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware and services, partially offset by growth in revenue from software and IP.

For the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the United States, Other Americas, Asia, and Europe, Middle East and Africa during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, see the general description under “Revenue by Year” above. Revenue for Japan decreased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to difficult business conditions facing our Japanese customers.Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue 2017 2016 2015United States42% 46% 46%Other Americas2% 2% 1%Asia27% 25% 24%Europe, Middle East and Africa20% 19% 19%Japan9% 8% 10%Total100% 100% 100%Revenue by geography fluctuates from period to period based on demand for, and our available resources to deliver and support, our products and services.Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion under Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Cost of Revenue Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$156.7 $183.3 $155.7 $(26.6) (15)% $27.6 18 %Services80.7 73.2 82.8 7.5 10 % (9.6) (12)%Total cost of revenue$237.4 $256.5 $238.5 $(19.1) (7)% $18.0 8 %31Table of ContentsThe following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015: 2017 2016 2015Product and maintenance9% 11% 10%Services63% 55% 67%Cost of Product and MaintenanceCost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and IP products, certain employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, cost of our customer support services, amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles, costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include materials, assembly, testing, applicable reserves and overhead. These hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products.A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$114.9 $140.9 $115.2 $(26.0) (18)% $25.7 22%Amortization of acquired intangibles41.8 42.4 40.5 (0.6) (1)% 1.9 5%Total cost of product and maintenance$156.7 $183.3 $155.7 $(26.6) (15)% $27.6 18%Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period. Cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology.The changes in product and maintenance-related costs were due to the following: Change 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions)Emulation and prototyping hardware costs$(22.9) $28.0Other items(3.1) (2.3) $(26.0) $25.7Costs of emulation and prototyping hardware decreased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower revenue for emulation and prototyping hardware. Gross margins on our hardware products will fluctuate based on product life cycle, product competition, product mix and pricing strategies. Emulation and prototyping hardware costs increased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher emulation hardware volume and an increase in charges for reserves on inventory during fiscal 2016 as we approached the end of the product life cycle of Palladium XP, a previous generation of our Palladium hardware platform. Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects or on internal development projects. Cost of services increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, and decreased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to variation in the number of personnel dedicated to deliver and support our services and custom IP offerings.32Table of Contents Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Factors that cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, restructuring activities, foreign exchange rates, stock-based compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results.Stock-based compensation included in our operating expenses increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, and during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily because successive increases in the price of our common stock have resulted in higher grant-date fair values for the mix of stock awards expensed in each period. Many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Our operating expenses for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$419.2 $395.2 $402.4 $24.0 6% $(7.2) (2)%Research and development804.2 735.3 637.6 68.9 9% 97.7 15 %General and administrative134.2 125.1 110.0 9.1 7% 15.1 14 % $1,357.6 $1,255.6 $1,150.0 $102.0 8% $105.6 9 %Our operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 2017 2016 2015Marketing and sales22% 22% 24%Research and development41% 40% 38%General and administrative7% 7% 6%Operating expenses70% 69% 68% Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$18.5 $(6.3)Facilities and other infrastructure costs4.8 0.4Stock-based compensation4.1 1.0Professional services(1.6) (2.7)Other items(1.8) 0.4 $24.0 $(7.2)Costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2017 and an increase in incentive compensation. Costs included in marketing and sales decreased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to year-over-year headcount reductions within our sales organization. 33Table of ContentsResearch and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$44.4 $75.7Stock-based compensation13.2 14.3Facilities and other infrastructure costs9.8 9.9Professional services3.2 (0.7)Materials and other pre-production costs0.3 (6.7)Travel and professional development(1.4) 3.2Other items(0.6) 2.0 $68.9 $97.7We must invest significantly in product research and development to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology. The demand for new IC manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products and we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. Costs included in research and development increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, and during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to incremental investments in research and development as a result of additional hiring. General and AdministrativeThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions)Professional services$4.4 $0.5Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs3.3 4.4Stock-based compensation3.0 2.6Bad debt expense2.3 0.2Acquisition-related costs(4.9) 4.9Other items1.0 2.5 $9.1 $15.1General and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in accounting and tax services and an increase in employee salaries and benefits. General and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased headcount and merit adjustments for existing employees and costs associated with our fiscal 2016 acquisitions.Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Amortization of acquired intangibles$14.7 $18.1 $23.7 $(3.4) (19)% $(5.6) (24)%34Table of ContentsThe changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following: Change 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions)Increase due to additions of acquired intangibles$0.3 $1.0Decrease due to completed amortization of acquired intangibles(3.7) (6.6) $(3.4) $(5.6)Restructuring and Other ChargesWe have initiated several restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.The following table presents restructuring and other charges (credits), net for our restructuring plans:SeveranceandBenefits ExcessFacilities Other Total (In millions)Fiscal 2017$9.0 $0.4 $— $9.4Fiscal 2016$40.4 $0.6 $— $41.0Fiscal 2015$3.6 $1.1 $(0.2) $4.5For an additional description of our restructuring plans, see Note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of the following: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense: 2015 Notes$— $— $3.02019 Term Loan7.6 5.6 —2024 Notes15.3 15.3 15.3Revolving credit facility1.3 1.6 0.5Amortization of debt discount: 2015 Notes— — 8.52019 Term Loan0.2 0.2 —2024 Notes0.7 0.6 0.6Other0.6 0.4 0.4Total interest expense$25.7 $23.7 $28.3For an additional description of our debt arrangements, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.35Table of ContentsIncome TaxesThe following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Provision for income taxes$110.9 $34.1 $15.2Effective tax rate35.2% 14.4% 5.7%The Tax Act included several provisions that affected us significantly, such as a one-time, mandatory transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings (the “transition tax”) and a reduction in the federal corporation income tax rate to 21% as of January 1, 2018.Because the Tax Act requires complex computations that require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced, and because certain tax and accounting effects are currently uncertain, we were unable to complete our accounting for the Tax Act in fiscal 2017. We recorded provisional amounts for the changes to the tax law for which a reasonable estimate could be determined. If a reasonable estimate could not be made, we continued to apply the tax rules in effect prior to the Tax Act. We expect to refine our provisional amounts and to complete our accounting for the Tax Act during fiscal 2018 as we obtain, prepare and analyze additional information that we expect to be available during fiscal 2018. For further discussion regarding our accounting for the Tax Act, see Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to income tax effects of the Tax Act. The provisional amount related to the transition tax was $67.2 million and the provisional amount related to the re-measurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities for the U.S. tax rate reduction was $25.2 million. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 included $32.0 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or settled during the period.Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2016 income and includes the tax benefit resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the United States research tax credit in December 2015. During fiscal 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for stock-based compensation that requires all income tax effects of stock-based awards to be recognized in our consolidated income statement as the awards vest or are settled. We adopted the accounting standard on a prospective basis and prior fiscal periods were not restated. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 includes $17.2 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or settled during the period.Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2015 income, which was partially offset by $13.8 million of tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax examination of a foreign subsidiary. Our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of $10.1 million resulting from the enactment of the United States research tax credit in December 2015. Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. We currently expect that our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 13%. We expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. We may also revise our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate as a result of further analyzing the implications of the Tax Act and as we complete the accounting for the Tax Act. For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.36Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 January 2, 2016 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments$692.5 $468.3 $711.2 $224.2 $(242.9)Net working capital$337.6 $116.5 $427.9 $221.1 $(311.4)Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term InvestmentsAs of December 30, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $692.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $468.3 million as of December 31, 2016.Our primary sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2017 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.Our primary uses of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2017 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, payments on our revolving credit facility, purchases of property, plant and equipment, and tax payments. Approximately 80% of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. We expect that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.Net Working CapitalNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The increase in our net working capital as of December 30, 2017, as compared to December 31, 2016, is primarily due to a net increase in cash and cash equivalents.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$470.7 $444.9 $378.2 $25.8 $66.7Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors and improved profitability.We expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including our operating results, the timing of our billings, collections, disbursements and tax payments.37Table of ContentsCash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows provided by (used for) investing activities during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions)Cash provided by (used for) investing activities$(191.2) $1.4 $(44.5) $(192.6) $45.9The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for business combinations and a decrease in net proceeds from our investment portfolio. The increase in cash flows provided by investing activities during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to an increase in proceeds resulting from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by an increase in cash used for business combinations and asset acquisitions. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making long-term equity investments.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In millions)Cash used for financing activities$(70.1) $(592.7) $(626.3) $522.6 $33.6The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock, partially offset by a net decrease in proceeds from borrowings. The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to proceeds from the 2019 Term Loan and our revolving credit facility and a decrease in payments made to settle outstanding borrowings, offset by an increase in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesTax ActThe Tax Act provides an election to pay the net tax liability for the transition tax in eight annual installments. We have currently estimated a provisional net tax liability of approximately $3 million for the transition tax. The provisional net tax liability is less than the provisional federal income tax expense for the transition tax primarily because we expect to utilize tax credit carryforwards to reduce our transition tax payable. The re-measurement of our deferred tax assets for the U.S. tax rate reduction is a non-cash expense. We currently do not expect the Tax Act to otherwise significantly impact the amount of our cash used to pay income taxes in fiscal 2018. However, we continue to review the impact of the Tax Act on our cash taxes.The Tax Act provides that we may repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2018 and future years without additional U.S. federal income taxes. We are currently evaluating our plans for our earnings from foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not expect to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from our foreign subsidiaries although we continue to assess our plans, including the impact of the Tax Act. We are also evaluating our plans for dividends from our foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2018. 38Table of ContentsStock Repurchase ProgramIn January 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to $525.0 million in the aggregate. We expect to repurchase approximately $50 million of our common stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, acquisition opportunities and other factors. As of December 30, 2017, approximately $425 million remained available under this authorization. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information.Revolving Credit FacilityOur senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $350.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million. The credit facility expires on January 28, 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on January 28, 2022. Outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. As of December 30, 2017, there were $85.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.2019 Term LoanIn January 2016, we entered into a $300.0 million three-year senior unsecured non-amortizing term loan facility due on January 28, 2019 (the “2019 Term Loan”) with a group of lenders led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2019 Term Loan is unsecured and may be settled at any time if we elect to do so. 2024 NotesIn October 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. The proceeds from the 2024 Notes are available for general corporate purposes, which may include the retirement of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic transactions.Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 30, 2017 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions)Operating lease obligations$100.0 $28.1 $33.2 $17.0 $21.7Purchase obligations (1)31.8 23.9 7.2 0.3 0.4Long-term debt650.0 — 300.0 — 350.0Revolving credit facility85.0 85.0 — — —Contractual interest payments121.7 27.3 32.6 31.2 30.6Current income tax payable3.9 3.9 — — —Other long-term contractual obligations (2)36.6 — 13.7 11.5 11.4Total$1,029.0 $168.2 $386.7 $60.0 $414.1_________________(1) With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, this table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of December 30, 2017 or the earliest cancellation date.(2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $20.7 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. Of the $20.7 million, we estimate $9.4 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years, $9.4 million within 3 to 5 years and $1.9 million in more than 5 years. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.39Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 30, 2017, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Accounting for Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Tax Act has many provisions that require additional guidance on specific interpretations of the tax law changes. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.We only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition We begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: •we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; •delivery has occurred; •the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement; and •collectibility of the fee is probable.Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. For contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment, we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. If we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on time-based licenses, revenue from such licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.40Table of ContentsWe must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a time-based arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. We have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable, without providing concessions on payments, products or services.Generally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. Key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment, including public information, historical and current financial statements and past collection history. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment. Revenue associated with our time-based licenses is recognized over the term of the arrangement, commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product. In general, product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) exists for the undelivered maintenance, is recognized up front, upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met, and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. If certain other criteria are met, revenue for design IP is recognized upon delivery and we accrue the expected costs of maintenance. A relatively small percentage of our revenue from software and IP licenses is recognized on an upfront basis.Our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software, and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software. Consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Revenue from services and customized IP arrangements is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. If a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement (“MEA”) that includes a software contract, revenue is generally recognized over the duration of the software contract. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances, and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations.If a group of contracts is so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such arrangements are deemed to be an MEA. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, an MEA. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an MEA can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts, which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved. For example, a perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an MEA when it is executed within close proximity, or in contemplation of, other license agreements with the same customer that require revenue recognition over time, in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the MEA instead of up front. For an MEA that includes software and nonsoftware elements, we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met. In these circumstances, there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows: •VSOE of fair value;•Third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”); and •Best estimate of the selling price (“BESP”). We calculate the BESP of our hardware products based on our pricing practices, including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products, because VSOE or TPE cannot be established. Our process for determining BESP for our software deliverables without VSOE or TPE takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Key external and internal factors considered in developing the BESPs include prices charged by us for similar arrangements, historical pricing practices and the nature of the product. In addition, when developing BESPs, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the BESP of the deliverables in our arrangements.41Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.New Accounting Standards Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605).” Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, Topic 606 requires enhanced disclosures, including disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. Topic 606 permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of applying the guidance as of the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). We will adopt the standard using the cumulative catch-up transition method.Topic 606 is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In preparation for adoption of the standard, we implemented changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within them. The most significant impacts of our adoption of Topic 606 are as follows:•Our revenue mix is expected to remain approximately 90% recognizable over time under Topic 606, as it was under Topic 605;•The use of the cumulative catch-up method upon adoption of Topic 606 requires us to evaluate only contracts that were in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under Topic 606 from the beginning of their terms;•We expect approximately 3% of our existing backlog at the beginning of fiscal 2018 will be adjusted through retained earnings upon adoption of Topic 606, and such backlog will not be recognized as revenue in future periods under Topic 606. Because this revenue would have been recognized in prior periods had Topic 606 then been in effect, we will also have related changes to our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances;•Because of the transition method, revenue generated under Topic 606 is expected to be slightly lower than revenue would have been under Topic 605 in 2018; and•In 2018, the year of adoption, we will report revenue under Topic 606 with supplemental disclosures of what revenue would have been under Topic 605.We will continue to recognize revenue over time for our time-based software arrangements, which represent a large majority of our total revenue, because the multiple software licenses and related updates in our time-based arrangements constitute a single, combined performance obligation. The timing of revenue recognition for our hardware and professional services is expected to remain substantially unchanged.42Table of ContentsThe adoption of Topic 606 will impact our accounting for MEAs that combine many software-related deliverables, which may include multiple software contracts with varying terms, IP licenses, and/or service elements. Topic 605 requires VSOE to recognize revenue separately for the different undelivered elements. We have not established VSOE under Topic 605, thus the revenue related to these agreements is generally recognized over time beginning with the delivery of the last specified deliverable and ending on the latest end date. Topic 606 requires us to separate the different elements through the use of stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”), and to recognize the revenue allocated to the different elements as if those elements had been sold on a standalone basis, either up front or over time. Certain IP license agreements will be recognized up front under Topic 606, as opposed to over time under Topic 605. In addition, certain software agreements will be recognized over time under Topic 606, as opposed to up front under Topic 605. Despite these changes, we expect our revenue mix will be similar, such that approximately 90% of our revenue is recognized over time.More judgments and estimates are required under Topic 606 than are required under Topic 605, including estimating the SSP for each performance obligation identified within our contracts. Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and vary in some instances.Under the cumulative catch-up transition method, we have evaluated our contracts that were in effect on the adoption date as if they had been accounted for under Topic 606 from contract inception. Some revenue related to the MEAs and IP arrangements noted above that would have been recognized in future periods under Topic 605 will be recast under Topic 606 as if the revenue had been recognized in prior periods. As this transition method requires that we not adjust historical reported revenue amounts, the revenue that would have been recognized under this method prior to the adoption date will be an adjustment to retained earnings and will not be recognized as revenue in future periods as previously planned. Because of this transition method, approximately 3% of our year-end backlog will be adjusted to retained earnings upon adoption.Topic 606 also requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. This requires that we capitalize commission costs that are directly related to obtaining customer contracts and amortize them over the life of the contract. We anticipate the amount of the amortization of capitalized commissions under Topic 606 will be similar to the amount of commissions expense for fiscal 2018 bookings under Topic 605 and will not have a significant impact on our consolidated income statements.Financial InstrumentsIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” which will impact certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The updated standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Upon the effective date of the new standard, all equity investments in unconsolidated entities, other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting, will generally be measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification for equity investments and therefore, the changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities will no longer be reported in other comprehensive income (loss).The updated standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment of investments at each reporting period. The new guidance must be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures based on our current holdings of equity investments.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” requiring, among other things, the recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet by lessees for certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard. While we are continuing to assess the potential impacts of the standard, we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets and may require changes to our systems and processes. We currently expect the most significant impact will be the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. The updated standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.43Table of ContentsIncome TaxIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income taxes (Topic 740): Intra-entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer when the transfer occurs. For intra-entity transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The new standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate the potential for increased volatility in future effective tax rates from the adoption of this guidance.In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) regarding the accounting for income taxes in the reporting period that includes the date on which the United States enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that will affect businesses. U.S. GAAP generally requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. SAB 118 will allow registrants to record provisional amounts for a period of up to one year from the date of enactment when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the changes in tax law. This provisional period ends when a company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond December 22, 2018. Because the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations are expected in the future, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax remeasurement, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We expect to refine our provisional amounts and to complete our accounting for the Tax Act during fiscal 2018. For further discussion, see Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Business CombinationsIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business,” that revises the definition of a business as it relates to acquisitions, disposals, goodwill impairments and consolidations. The updated standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” that eliminates “Step 2” from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.Stock-based CompensationIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting,” that provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.Income Tax Effects within Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive income,” that allows a reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The new guidance may be applied at the beginning of the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in federal income tax rate from the Tax Act is recognized. The new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.44Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activities are transacted in the U.S. dollar. In certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in U.S. dollars, a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets.In certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of December 30, 2017. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured during January 2018.

We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 30, 2017.Interest rates under our revolving credit facility and 2019 Term Loan are variable, so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Interest rates for our revolving credit facility and 2019 Term Loan can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 30, 2017, there were $85.0 million borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. For an additional description of the revolving credit facility and 2019 Term Loan, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Equity Price RiskEquity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments. Our non-marketable investments had a carrying value of $3.0 million as of December 30, 2017, and $3.2 million as of December 31, 2016.",2023-12-30 20:47:10.768753
813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe enable our customers to design electronic products. Our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic systems, ICs, electronic devices and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products. Our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. We offer software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks, which are commonly referred to as IP.Our strategy, which we call SDE, is to provide the technologies necessary for our customers to develop a complete and functional electronic product. Our SDE strategy enables us to address the growing trends of electronic systems companies developing their own ICs as part of their end product systems, as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of the systems into which their IC products are integrated. Our products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products, so demand for our products is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as EDA. Today, our offerings include and extend beyond EDA tools to include SDE.We combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities:•Functional Verification, including Emulation and Prototyping Hardware;•Digital IC Design and Signoff;•Custom IC Design and Simulation;•System Interconnect and Analysis; and •IP.For additional information about our products, see the discussion in Item 1, “Business,” under the heading “Products and Product Strategy.”We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Results of OperationsFinancial results for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017 and 2016, reflect the following:•the effects of adopting ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which provided a new basis of accounting for our revenue arrangements during fiscal 2018;•increased product and maintenance revenue resulting from overall growth in our software, hardware and IP business, particularly in the United States and Asia; and•continued investment in research and development activities focused on creating and enhancing our products.The adoption of Topic 606 limits the comparability of revenue and certain expenses, including sales commissions, presented in the results of operations for fiscal 2018, when compared to the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. For additional information regarding the adoption of this and other accounting standards at the beginning of fiscal 2018, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards.”Our fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were each 52-week fiscal years.RevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.Approximately 90% of our revenue is recognized over time, and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized at the point in time that control is transferred to the customer. Revenue recognized over time includes revenue from our software arrangements, services, royalties from certain IP arrangements, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. Revenue recognized at a point in time is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and IP licenses. Our ability to maintain this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers.24Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2018, we recognized revenue based on ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” whereas during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we recognized revenue based on “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605).” Therefore, the periods are not directly comparable. For additional information on the impact of the new accounting standard on our revenue, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards.”Revenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 and the change in revenue between years: Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$1,997.9 $1,814.0 $1,683.8 $183.9 10% $130.2 8 %Services140.1 129.0 132.3 11.1 9% (3.3) (2)%Total revenue$2,138.0 $1,943.0 $1,816.1 $195.0 10% $126.9 7 %Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily because of increased investments by our customers in new, complex designs for their products resulting in revenue growth in each of our five product categories. Product and maintenance revenue may fluctuate from period to period and by geography based on demand for our hardware and IP offerings. Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily because of growth in our software and IP businesses, partially offset by lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware.Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and IP performance obligations. No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.Revenue by Product GroupThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016: 2018 2017 2016Functional Verification, including hardware for emulation and prototyping24% 22% 25%Digital IC Design and Signoff29% 29% 29%Custom IC Design and Simulation26% 27% 25%System Interconnect and Analysis9% 10% 10%IP12% 12% 11%Total100% 100% 100%Revenue by product group fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services and our available resources to deliver and support them. Certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. 25Table of Contents Revenue by Geography Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions, except percentages)United States$924.6 $829.4 $832.6 $95.2 11 % $(3.2) — %Other Americas32.5 35.1 31.3 (2.6) (7)% 3.8 12 %Asia605.4 526.2 445.5 79.2 15 % 80.7 18 %Europe, Middle East and Africa406.9 385.7 346.7 21.2 5 % 39.0 11 %Japan168.6 166.6 160.0 2.0 1 % 6.6 4 %Total revenue$2,138.0 $1,943.0 $1,816.1 $195.0 10 % $126.9 7 %For the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the United States, Asia, and Europe, Middle East and Africa during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, see the general description under “Revenue by Year” above. Revenue for the United States decreased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware and services, partially offset by growth in revenue from software and IP. For the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for Other Americas, Asia, and Europe, Middle East and Africa and Japan during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, see the general description under “Revenue by Year” above.

Costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components, assembly, testing, applicable reserves and overhead. These costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products.A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$133.8 $114.9 $140.9 $18.9 16 % $(26.0) (18)%Amortization of acquired intangibles39.2 41.8 42.4 (2.6) (6)% (0.6) (1)%Total cost of product and maintenance$173.0 $156.7 $183.3 $16.3 10 % $(26.6) (15)%Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period. Cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology.The changes in product and maintenance-related costs were due to the following: Change 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions)Emulation and prototyping hardware costs$17.7 $(22.9)Other items1.2 (3.1) $18.9 $(26.0)Costs of emulation and prototyping increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to increased sales volume for emulation and prototyping hardware and related costs. Costs of emulation and prototyping hardware decreased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to decreased sales volume for emulation and prototyping hardware. Gross margins on our hardware products will fluctuate based on product life cycle, product competition, product mix and pricing strategies. Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects or on internal development projects. Cost of services increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to variation in the number of personnel dedicated to deliver and support our services and custom IP offerings. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, restructuring activities, foreign exchange rate movements, stock-based compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results.Stock-based compensation included in our operating expenses increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily because successive increases in the price of our common stock between grant dates have resulted in higher grant date fair values for the mix of stock awards expensed in each period. We expect stock-based compensation to increase operating expenses during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. For further discussion regarding stock-based compensation, see Note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.27Table of ContentsMany of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Our operating expenses for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$439.7 $419.2 $395.2 $20.5 5 % $24.0 6%Research and development884.8 804.2 735.3 80.6 10 % 68.9 9%General and administrative133.4 134.2 125.1 (0.8) (1)% 9.1 7% $1,457.9 $1,357.6 $1,255.6 $100.3 7 % $102.0 8%Our operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: 2018 2017 2016Marketing and sales21% 22% 22%Research and development41% 41% 40%General and administrative6% 7% 7%Operating expenses68% 70% 69% Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$9.0 $18.5Stock-based compensation7.8 4.1Professional services2.2 (1.6)Facilities and other infrastructure costs0.8 4.8Other items0.7 (1.8) $20.5 $24.0Costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2018 and an increase in incentive compensation. 28Table of ContentsResearch and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$52.5 $44.4Stock-based compensation27.1 13.2Depreciation2.7 (0.5)Facilities and other infrastructure costs0.4 9.8Materials and other pre-production costs(1.9) 0.3Software license and maintenance costs(1.7) 0.6Professional services(0.1) 3.2Other items1.6 (2.1) $80.6 $68.9We must invest significantly in product research and development to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology. The demand for new IC manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products and we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. Costs included in research and development increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to incremental investments in research and development as a result of additional hiring and incremental costs resulting from our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.

General and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in accounting and tax services and an increase in employee salaries and benefits.Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions, except percentages)Amortization of acquired intangibles$14.1 $14.7 $18.1 $(0.6) (4)% $(3.4) (19)%29Table of ContentsThe changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following: Change 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions)Increase due to additions of acquired intangibles$0.6 $0.3Decrease due to completed amortization of acquired intangibles(1.2) (3.7) $(0.6) $(3.4)Restructuring and Other ChargesWe have initiated restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.The following table presents restructuring and other charges, net for our restructuring plans:2018 2017 2016 (In millions)Severance and Benefits$10.3 $9.0 $40.4Excess Facilities0.8 0.4 0.6Total$11.1 $9.4 $41.0For an additional description of our restructuring plans, see Note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was comprised of the following: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense: 2019 Term Loan$5.3 $7.6 $5.62024 Notes15.3 15.3 15.3Revolving credit facility1.1 1.3 1.6Amortization of debt discount: 2019 Term Loan0.2 0.2 0.22024 Notes0.7 0.7 0.6Other0.5 0.6 0.4Total interest expense$23.1 $25.7 $23.7 During fiscal 2018, we prepaid the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on our $300.0 million 2019 Term Loan. For an additional description of our debt arrangements, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages)Provision for income taxes$30.6 $110.9 $34.1Effective tax rate8.1% 35.2% 14.4%Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 primarily resulted from the federal income tax effects of the Tax Act and state and foreign income taxes on fiscal 2018 income, partially offset by $21.3 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the year.30Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2018, we finalized our fiscal 2017 deemed repatriation transition tax calculation and reduced our estimate from $67.2 million to $65.8 million. We finalized our other fiscal 2017 provisional estimates without change. For further discussion regarding our accounting for the Tax Act, see Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 is primarily attributable to income tax effects of the Tax Act. The provisional amount related to the transition tax was $67.2 million and the provisional amount related to the re-measurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities for the U.S. tax rate reduction was $25.2 million. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 included $32.0 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or settled during the period.Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 is primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2016 income and includes the tax benefit resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the United States research tax credit in December 2015. During fiscal 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for stock-based compensation that required all income tax effects of stock-based awards to be recognized in our consolidated income statement as the awards vest or are settled. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 includes $17.2 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or settled during the period.Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. We currently expect that our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will be approximately 10%. We expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. We may also revise our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate as a result of further analyzing the implications of the Tax Act, including future guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS. For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$533.3 $688.1 $465.2 $(154.8) $222.9Net working capital$242.1 $337.6 $116.5 $(95.5) $221.1Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of December 29, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $533.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $688.1 million as of December 30, 2017.Our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2018 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.Our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2018 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, principal payments on the 2019 Term Loan, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of non-marketable investments, payments on our revolving credit facility, tax payments and purchases of property, plant and equipment. Approximately 75% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 29, 2018. We expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.Net Working CapitalNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in our net working capital as of December 29, 2018, as compared to December 30, 2017, is primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increases in current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.31Table of ContentsCash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$604.8 $470.7 $444.9 $134.1 $25.8Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows provided by (used for) investing activities during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions)Cash provided by (used for) investing activities$(173.8) $(191.2) $1.4 $17.4 $(192.6)The decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily because we did not acquire any businesses in fiscal 2018, offset by payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities. The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for business combinations and a decrease in net proceeds from our investment portfolio. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (In millions)Cash used for financing activities$(567.9) $(70.1) $(592.7) $(497.8) $522.6The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily due to the prepayment of the outstanding principal balance on our $300.0 million 2019 Term Loan, an increase in repurchases of common stock and a decrease in net proceeds on our revolving credit facility. The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock, partially offset by a net decrease in proceeds from borrowings. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Repurchase ProgramIn January 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to $525.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 29, 2018, approximately $175.0 million remained available under this authorization. In February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the additional repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information.32Table of ContentsRevolving Credit FacilityOur senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $350.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million. The credit facility expires on January 28, 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on January 28, 2022. Outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. As of December 29, 2018, there were $100.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility.2024 NotesIn October 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. As of December 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 Notes.For additional information relating to our debt arrangements, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2018 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions)Operating lease obligations$112.0 $26.3 $42.9 $25.7 $17.1Purchase obligations (1)24.7 18.1 5.8 0.7 0.1Long-term debt350.0 — — — 350.0Revolving credit facility100.0 100.0 — — —Contractual interest payments97.4 19.7 31.7 30.7 15.3Current income tax payable5.1 5.1 — — —Other long-term contractual obligations (2)37.7 0.1 23.0 3.1 11.5Total$726.9 $169.3 $103.4 $60.2 $394.0_________________(1) With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, this table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of December 29, 2018 or the earliest cancellation date.(2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $18.7 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. Of the $18.7 million, we estimate $17.5 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years and $1.2 million within 3 to 5 years. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 29, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.33Table of ContentsAccounting for Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Tax Act has many provisions that require additional guidance on specific interpretations of the tax law changes. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.We only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or IP licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. Determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. In some arrangements, such as most of our IP license arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. In other arrangements, like our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. Our time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation.Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”) for each distinct performance obligation. We rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the SSP for each performance obligation. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the SSP.Revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses, updates, and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations. For our professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. For our other performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized using a time-based measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term.If a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.We are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.34Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.New Accounting Standards LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” requiring, among other things, the recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet by lessees for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. A modified retrospective approach is required, applying the new standard to leases existing as of the date of initial application. An entity may choose to apply the standard as of either its effective date or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We adopted the new standard on December 30, 2018, the first day of fiscal 2019, and used the effective date as our date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to carry forward our prior conclusions about lease identification and classification. We estimate the key change upon adoption of the standard will result in balance sheet recognition of additional lease assets and lease liabilities ranging from $75 to $85 million as of December 30, 2018, which is based on the present value of committed lease payments. We do not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of lease expenses within our consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The new standard also provides updated guidance for lessor accounting; however, we do not expect the new standard to have a material effect on our financial statements for arrangements in which we are the lessor.Credit LossesIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which supersedes current guidance requiring recognition of credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred. The new standard requires the establishment of an allowance for estimated credit losses on financial assets, including trade and other receivables, at each reporting date. The new standard will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses on trade and other receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash. The new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” that eliminates “Step 2” from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.35Table of ContentsIncome Tax Effects within Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,” which allows a reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The new guidance may be applied at the beginning of the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in federal income tax rate from the Tax Act is recognized. The new standard became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will impact our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.Stock-based CompensationIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, “Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” to simplify the accounting for share-based transactions with nonemployees in which the grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed. Under the new standard, most of the guidance on recording share-based compensation granted to nonemployees will be aligned with the requirements for share-based compensation granted to employees. This standard became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Fair Value MeasurementsIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,” which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. While we continue to assess the potential impact of this standard, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.Internal-use SoftwareIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,” which clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.36Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activities are transacted in the U.S. dollar. In certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in U.S. dollars, a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets.In certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of December 29, 2018. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured during February 2019.

We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 29, 2018.Interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable, so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Interest rates for our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 29, 2018, there were $100.0 million borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. For an additional description of the revolving credit facility, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Equity Price RiskEquity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us.

813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe enable our customers to develop electronic products. Our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic devices and systems, SoCs, ICs and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products. Our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. We offer software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks, which are commonly referred to as IP.Our strategy, which we call Intelligent System Design™, is to provide the technologies necessary for our electronic system and semiconductor customers to develop electronic products across a variety of vertical markets including mobile, consumer, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and medical segments. Our products and services enable our customers to develop complex and innovative electronic products, so demand for our technology is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as EDA. Today, our offerings include and extend beyond EDA.We combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities:•Functional Verification, including Emulation and Prototyping Hardware;•Digital IC Design and Signoff;•Custom IC Design and Simulation;•System Interconnect and Analysis; and •IP.For additional information about our products, see the discussion in Item 1, “Business,” under the heading “Products and Product Strategy.”On January 15, 2020, we completed our acquisition of AWR. On February 6, 2020, we also acquired Integrand Software. The aggregate cash consideration for these acquisitions of approximately $195 million will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. These acquisitions enhance our technology portfolio to address growing RF/microwave design activity, driven by expanding use of 5G communications. We expect these acquisitions will result in more expenses, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, than revenue during fiscal 2020.We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Results of OperationsThe discussion of our fiscal 2019 consolidated results of operations include year-over-year comparisons versus fiscal 2018 for revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, other non-operating expenses, income taxes and cash flows. For a discussion of the fiscal 2018 changes compared to fiscal 2017, see the discussion in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, filed on February 27, 2019.Results of operations for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, reflect the following:•increased product and maintenance revenue resulting from overall growth in each geographic area, particularly in China and Other Asia;•increased IP revenue; •increased selling costs, including additional investment in technical sales support in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements; and•continued investment in research and development activities focused on creating and enhancing our products; and•a non-cash tax benefit resulting from intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary.Our fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2019 and 2018 were each 52-week fiscal years. Fiscal 2020 will be a 53-week fiscal year.26Table of ContentsRevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.Between 85% and 90% of our revenue is characterized as recurring revenue. Revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our IP Access Agreements. The remainder of our revenue is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual IP licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue may be impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers in any single fiscal period.Revenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2019 and 2018 and the change in revenue between years: Change 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$2,204.6 $1,997.9 $206.7 10 %Services131.7 140.1 (8.4) (6)%Total revenue$2,336.3 $2,138.0 $198.3 9 %Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily because of increased investments by our customers in new, complex designs for their products that include the design of electronic systems for AI, 5G networks, aerospace and defense, automotive, cloud data center and other market segments. This demand has resulted in revenue growth in each geographic area and each of our five product categories. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and IP performance obligations.No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2019 or 2018.Revenue by Product CategoryThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product categories and services during fiscal 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018Functional Verification, including hardware for emulation and prototyping23% 24%Digital IC Design and Signoff30% 29%Custom IC Design and Simulation25% 26%System Interconnect and Analysis9% 9%IP13% 12%Total100% 100%Revenue by product group fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services and our available resources to deliver and support them. Certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. 27Table of Contents Revenue by Geography Change 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions, except percentages)United States$982.4 $924.6 $57.8 6%Other Americas43.5 32.5 11.0 34%China241.5 210.2 31.3 15%Other Asia459.0 395.2 63.8 16%Europe, Middle East and Africa433.3 406.9 26.4 6%Japan176.6 168.6 8.0 5%Total revenue$2,336.3 $2,138.0 $198.3 9%For the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for each geographic area during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, see the general description under “Revenue by Year"" above. Revenue in China increased during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in revenue for IP, digital IC design and signoff, and system interconnect software products. Revenue growth in China slowed during the second half of fiscal 2019 because we were unable to deliver maintenance or support for certain customers in China due to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s designation of certain customers to the “Entity List.” We expect these restrictions will continue to impact revenue from certain customers in China in fiscal 2020.Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue 2019 2018United States42% 43%Other Americas2% 2%China10% 10%Other Asia20% 18%Europe, Middle East and Africa18% 19%Japan8% 8%Total100% 100%Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar.

Costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components, assembly, testing, applicable reserves and overhead. These costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products.A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2019 and 2018 is as follows: Change 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$148.1 $133.8 $14.3 11%Amortization of acquired intangibles41.0 39.2 1.8 5%Total cost of product and maintenance$189.1 $173.0 $16.1 9%Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period.

Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization. Cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects rather than internal development projects. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, foreign exchange rate movements, stock-based compensation, restructuring activities and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results.Many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”29Table of ContentsOur operating expenses for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows: Change 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$481.7 $439.7 $42.0 10%Research and development935.9 884.8 51.1 6%General and administrative139.8 133.4 6.4 5%Total operating expenses$1,557.4 $1,457.9 $99.5 7%Our operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 2019 2018Marketing and sales21% 21%Research and development40% 41%General and administrative6% 6%Total operating expenses67% 68% Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$30.6Stock-based compensation4.4Travel and sales meetings2.8Facilities and other infrastructure costs2.4Other items1.8Total change in marketing and sales expense$42.0Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to additional headcount as a result of hiring and an increase in employee incentive compensation.Research and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$33.6Stock-based compensation10.3Depreciation4.3Product development costs3.3Other items(0.4)Total change in research and development expense$51.1Costs included in research and development increased during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to additional headcount as a result of hiring.30Table of ContentsGeneral and AdministrativeThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions)Professional services$4.5University endowment3.0Acquisition-related costs2.2Bad debt expense(4.5)Other items1.2Total change in general and administrative expense$6.4 Professional services included in general and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to consulting fees related to an internal realignment of our international operating structure.

Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.The following table presents restructuring and other charges, net for our restructuring plans:2019 2018 (In millions)Severance and benefits$8.6 $10.3Excess facilities— 0.8Total$8.6 $11.1For an additional description of our restructuring plans, see Note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.31Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseInterest expense for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was comprised of the following: 2019 2018 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense: 2019 Term Loan$— $5.32024 Notes15.3 15.3Revolving credit facility2.4 1.1Amortization of debt discount: 2019 Term Loan— 0.22024 Notes0.7 0.7Other0.4 0.5Total interest expense$18.8 $23.1 During fiscal 2018, we prepaid the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on our $300.0 million 2019 Term Loan. For an additional description of our debt arrangements, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe following table presents the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 (In millions, except percentages)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$(510.0) $30.6Effective tax rate(106.5)% 8.1%During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary, which resulted in the establishment of a net deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $575.6 million. We expect to be able to realize the deferred tax asset in future periods and did not provide for a valuation allowance. This income tax benefit was partially offset by the federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2019 income. We also recognized $36.8 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the year.Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 primarily resulted from the federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2018 income, partially offset by $21.3 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the year. During fiscal 2018, we finalized our fiscal 2017 deemed repatriation transition tax calculation and reduced our estimate from $67.2 million to $65.8 million. We finalized our other fiscal 2017 provisional estimates without change. For further discussion regarding our accounting for the Tax Act, see Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. We currently expect that our fiscal 2020 effective tax rate will be approximately 20%. We expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2020 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.32Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources As of Change December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$705.2 $533.3 $688.1 $171.9 $(154.8)Net working capital497.0 242.1 337.6 254.9 (95.5)Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of December 28, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $705.2 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $533.3 million as of December 29, 2018.Our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2019 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.Our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2019 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, repurchases of our common stock, payments on our revolving credit facility, purchases of property, plant and equipment and purchases of non-marketable investments. Approximately 43% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 28, 2019. Our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings. We expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.Net Working CapitalNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The increase in our net working capital as of December 28, 2019, as compared to December 29, 2018, is primarily due to improved results from operations, the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows: Change 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$729.6 $604.8 $124.8Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows: Change 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions)Cash used for investing activities$(105.7) $(173.8) $68.133Table of ContentsThe decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed two business combinations for cash consideration of approximately $195 million, which will be classified as cash used for investing activities.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows: Change 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 (In millions)Cash used for financing activities$(443.9) $(567.9) $124.0The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in net cash paid for debt arrangements, partially offset by an increase in payments for repurchases of our common stock.Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Repurchase ProgramIn February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $500 million of our common stock. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. As of December 28, 2019, approximately $369.0 million remained available under this authorization. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information.Revolving Credit FacilityOur senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $350.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million. The credit facility expires on January 28, 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on January 28, 2022. Outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. As of December 28, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility.2024 NotesIn October 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. As of December 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 Notes.For additional information relating to our debt arrangements, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.34Table of ContentsContractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 28, 2019 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions)Operating lease obligations$124.8 $29.3 $50.1 $26.0 $19.4Purchase obligations (1)42.7 20.3 16.5 5.6 0.3Long-term debt350.0 — — 350.0 —Contractual interest payments77.6 15.8 31.2 30.6 —Current income tax payable9.5 9.5 — — —Other long-term contractual obligations (2)38.6 — 19.6 4.7 14.3Total$643.2 $74.9 $117.4 $416.9 $34.0_________________(1) With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, this table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of December 28, 2019 or the earliest cancellation date.(2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $18.7 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. Of the $18.7 million, we estimate $16.6 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years, $2.0 million within 3 to 5 years and $0.1 million in more than 5 years. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 28, 2019, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Accounting for Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Tax Act has provisions that require additional guidance on specific interpretations of the tax law changes. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.35Table of ContentsWe only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.During fiscal 2019, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary, which resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $575.6 million. To determine the value of the deferred tax asset, we were required to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of the transferred IP rights. These estimates included, but are not limited to, the income and cash flows that the IP rights are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate discount rate to apply to the income and cash flow projections, and the useful lives of the IP rights. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, it would impact the fair value of the IP rights and the related value of the deferred tax asset and the income tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2019 and in future periods when the deferred tax asset is realized. In addition, we reviewed the need to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of $575.6 million by evaluating whether there is a greater than 50% likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make significant estimates and predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. We give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. Based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence, we concluded that it is greater than 50% likely that the deferred tax asset of $575.6 million will be realized in future periods and that a valuation allowance was not currently required. If, in the future, we evaluate that this deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized, an increase in the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax expense in the period such determination is made.Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or IP licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. Determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. In some arrangements, such as most of our IP license arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. In other arrangements, like our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. Our time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation.Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”) for each distinct performance obligation. We rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the SSP for each performance obligation. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the SSP.Revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses, updates, and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations. For our professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. For our other performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized using a time-based measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term.If a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.We are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.36Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.New Accounting Standards Credit LossesIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which supersedes current guidance requiring recognition of credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred. The new standard requires the establishment of an allowance for estimated credit losses on financial assets, including trade and other receivables, at each reporting date. The new standard will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses on trade and other receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” that eliminates “Step 2” from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.Fair Value MeasurementsIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,” which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing ArrangementIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,” which clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements. The new standard aligns the treatment of implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts with the treatment of similar costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Under the new standard, implementation costs are deferred and presented in the same line item as a prepayment of related arrangement fees. The deferred costs are recognized over the term of the arrangement in the same line item as the related fees of the arrangement. The new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and will be applied prospectively to costs incurred after the date of adoption. The adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.Accounting for Income TaxesIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impacts of the provisions of this standard on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.37Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activities are transacted in the U.S. dollar. In certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in U.S. dollars, a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets.In certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency, our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of December 28, 2019. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured during February 2020.

We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 28, 2019.Interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable, so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Interest rates for our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 28, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. For an additional description of the revolving credit facility, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Equity Price RiskEquity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments.",2023-12-30 20:46:50.907873
813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe enable our customers to develop electronic products. Our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of ICs, SoCs, and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. Our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market, improving engineering productivity and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. We offer software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks, which are commonly referred to as IP.Our strategy, which we call Intelligent System Design™, is to provide the technology necessary for our customers to develop electronic products across a variety of vertical markets including consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. Our products and services enable our customers to develop complex and innovative electronic products, so demand for our technology is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as EDA. Today, our offerings include and extend beyond EDA.We group our products into categories related to major design activities:•Custom IC Design and Simulation;•Digital IC Design and Signoff;•Functional Verification;•IP; and•System Design and Analysis.For additional information about our products, see the discussion in Item 1, “Business,” under the heading “Products and Product Strategy.”During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed our acquisitions of AWR and Integrand. The aggregate cash consideration for these acquisitions of approximately $196 million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions enhance our technology portfolio to address growing radio frequency design activity, driven by expanding use of 5G communications. These acquisitions increased expenses, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, more than revenue during fiscal 2020.During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity of Belgium-based NUMECA, a leader in CFD, mesh generation, multi-physics simulation and optimization. The addition of NUMECA’s technologies and talent supports our Intelligent System Design™ strategy. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.Management uses certain performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”COVID-19 ImpactIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures. Our compliance with these containment measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our key customers, suppliers (including contract manufacturers) and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, a vast majority of our employees are still working remotely as of February 22, 2021.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused some volatility in our usual delivery timing for our hardware and IP products to certain customers. Many of our customers' employees are working remotely, and, in some cases, we have experienced delivery lead times that are longer than normal because of delays in getting access to customer sites to complete our deliveries. In other cases, the amount of our hardware and IP products that we have been able to deliver has been greater than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the respective period. We have also received numerous COVID-19 pandemic-related requests from our customers to allow them to delay their payments to us, while we continue to provide services to these customers. Despite the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has posed to our operations, it did not have material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows during fiscal 2020. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information on the impact of COVID-19.29Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe discussion of our fiscal 2020 consolidated results of operations include year-over-year comparisons to fiscal 2019 for revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other non-operating expenses, income taxes and cash flows. For a discussion of the fiscal 2019 changes compared to fiscal 2018, see the discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, filed on February 24, 2020.Our fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year, compared to 2019 and 2018, which were each 52-week fiscal years. The additional week in fiscal 2020 resulted in additional revenue of approximately $45 million and additional expense, including stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles, of approximately $35 million.Results of operations for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, reflect the following:•increased product and maintenance revenue, resulting from growth in software, IP and hardware, particularly in China and the United States;•higher selling costs, including additional investment in technical sales support in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements; •continued investment in research and development activities focused on expanding and enhancing our product portfolio; •decreased operating expenses for travel, meetings and events due to various measures implemented to contain COVID-19; •a 3 percentage point increase in operating margin driven primarily by revenue growth and temporary decreases in certain operating expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and•changes in our provision (benefit) for income taxes due to a non-cash tax benefit resulting from intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary during fiscal 2019.RevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.In any fiscal year, we expect that between 85% and 90% of our annual revenue will be characterized as recurring revenue. Revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our IP Access Agreements. The remainder of our revenue is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual IP licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue may be impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers in any single fiscal period.Revenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019 and the change in revenue between years: Change 202020192020 vs. 2019 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$2,536.6 $2,204.6 $332.0 15 %Services146.3 131.7 14.6 11 %Total revenue$2,682.9 $2,336.3 $346.6 15 %Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily because of increased investments by our customers in new, complex designs for their products that include the design of electronic systems for consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and IP performance obligations.No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2020 or 2019.30Table of ContentsRevenue by Product CategoryThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product categories and services during fiscal 2020 and 2019: 20202019Custom IC Design and Simulation25 %25 %Digital IC Design and Signoff29 %30 %Functional Verification, including Emulation and Prototyping Hardware22 %23 %IP14 %13 %System Design and Analysis10 %9 %Total100 %100 %Revenue by product category fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services, our available resources and our ability to deliver and support them. Certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product categories based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ.

We experienced an increase in demand in the first half of fiscal 2020 that resulted in approximately 13% of our total revenue being generated from customers in China, as compared to approximately 11% during the first half of fiscal 2019. This was followed by an additional increase in demand in the second half of fiscal 2020 that resulted in approximately 17% of our revenue being generated from customers in China, as compared to approximately 10% during the second half of fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2021, we expect revenue from our customers in China to be consistent, as a percentage of total revenue, with the first half of fiscal 2020. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we have not been able to deliver maintenance or support for certain customers in China due to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s designation of these customers to the “Entity List.” We expect these restrictions and new or expanded trade restrictions to continue to impact revenue from certain customers in China.For the primary factors contributing to the change in revenue for other geographies during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, see the general description under “Revenue by Year” and “Revenue by Product Category” above.31Table of ContentsRevenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue 20202019United States41 %42 %Other Americas1 %2 %China15 %10 %Other Asia18 %20 %Europe, Middle East and Africa18 %18 %Japan7 %8 %Total100 %100 %Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion under Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Cost of Revenue Change 202020192020 vs. 2019 (In millions, except percentages)Cost of product and maintenance$231.0 $189.1 $41.9 22 %Cost of services74.5 77.2 (2.7)(3)%Total cost of revenue$305.5 $266.3 $39.2 15 %The following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019: 20202019Cost of product and maintenance9 %9 %Cost of services51 %59 %Cost of Product and MaintenanceCost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and IP products, certain employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, cost of our customer support services, amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles, costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period, but is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, license third-party technology or IP, and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed technology or IP. A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2020 and 2019 is as follows: Change 202020192020 vs. 2019 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$184.8 $148.1 $36.7 25 %Amortization of acquired intangibles46.2 41.0 5.2 13 %Total cost of product and maintenance$231.0 $189.1 $41.9 22 %32Table of ContentsProduct and maintenance-related costs increased during fiscal 2020, when compared to fiscal 2019, due to the following: Change 2020 vs. 2019 (In millions)Emulation and prototyping hardware costs34.1 Professional services2.5 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs1.8 Other items(1.7)Total change in product and maintenance-related costs$36.7 Costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components, assembly, testing, applicable reserves and overhead. These costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products. The increase in emulation and prototyping hardware costs during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to increased demand for our emulation and prototyping hardware, increased reserves for inventory, and the mix of products generating revenue. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased by $9.4 million during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to technology-related intangible assets acquired from AWR and Integrand during fiscal 2020 and in-process technology being placed into service during fiscal 2020 and 2019. This increase was partially offset by certain technology-related intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2020 and 2019.Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization. Cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects rather than internal development projects. Despite an increase in services revenue, cost of services decreased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to a higher margin on the mix of services arrangements in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, and temporary savings due to the COVID pandemic.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, stock-based compensation, restructuring activities, foreign exchange rate movements, and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results. During fiscal 2020 we experienced decreased operating expenses for travel, meetings and events due to various measures implemented to contain COVID-19.Many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Our operating expenses for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: Change 202020192020 vs. 2019 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$516.5 $481.7 $34.8 7 %Research and development1,033.7 935.9 97.8 10 %General and administrative154.4 139.8 14.6 10 %Total operating expenses$1,704.6 $1,557.4 $147.2 9 %Our operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: 20202019Marketing and sales19 %21 %Research and development39 %40 %General and administrative6 %6 %Total operating expenses64 %67 %33Table of Contents Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2020 vs. 2019 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$41.7 Stock-based compensation3.0 Home office-related expenses2.0 Travel and sales meetings(13.0)Other items1.1 Total change in marketing and sales expense$34.8 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in marketing and sales expense increased due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions and variable compensation as we continue to invest in technical sales support in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements. This increase was partially offset by reduced costs for marketing events and travel due to COVID-19.Research and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2020 vs. 2019 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs95.7 Stock-based compensation10.3 Product development costs3.7 Home office-related expenses5.3 Facilities and other infrastructure costs(2.2)Professional services(2.8)Travel(11.8)Other items(0.4)Total change in research and development expense$97.8 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in research and development expense increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions and variable compensation as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio. This increase was partially offset by reduced costs for travel due to COVID-19. General and AdministrativeThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2020 vs. 2019 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$6.5 Facilities and other infrastructure costs2.6 University endowment2.0 Stock-based compensation2.0 Other items1.5 Total change in general and administrative expense$14.6 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in general and administrative expense increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to an increase in variable compensation and additional headcount from hiring.34Table of ContentsAmortization of Acquired IntangiblesAmortization of acquired intangibles consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks and patents. Amortization in any given period depends primarily the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets. Change 202020192020 vs. 2019 (In millions, except percentages)Amortization of acquired intangibles$18.0 $12.1 $5.9 49 %Amortization of acquired intangibles increased by $7.3 million during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to intangibles assets acquired from AWR and Integrand during fiscal 2020. This increase was partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2020 and 2019.Restructuring and Other ChargesWe have initiated restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.The following table presents restructuring and other charges, net for our restructuring plans:20202019(In millions)Severance and benefits$7.5 $8.6 Excess facilities1.7 — Total$9.2 $8.6 For an additional description of our restructuring plans, see Note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Operating marginOperating margin represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue. Our operating margin for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was as follows:20202019Operating margin24 %21 %Operating margin increased during fiscal, 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, because revenue growth exceeded the growth of our costs and expenses. During fiscal 2021, we expect growth in operating margin will be more moderate due to an increase in costs and expenses associated with acquisitions, including increased amortization of intangibles. We also expect an increase in expenses related to travel, meetings and events if measures implemented to contain COVID-19 are lifted.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was comprised of the following: 20202019 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense:2024 Notes$15.5 $15.3 Revolving credit facility4.4 2.4 Amortization of debt discount:2024 Notes0.8 0.7 Other— 0.4 Total interest expense$20.7 $18.8 Interest expense increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to borrowings of $350 million under our revolving credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as a precautionary measure to provide additional liquidity in light of global economic uncertainty. All outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. For an additional description of our debt arrangements, including our revolving credit facility, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.35Table of ContentsIncome TaxesThe following table presents the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 and 2019: 20202019 (In millions, except percentages)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$42.1 $(510.0)Effective tax rate6.7 %(106.5)%In June 2020, the State of California enacted legislation that, for a three-year period beginning in fiscal 2020, will limit our utilization of California research and development tax credits to $5 million annually and will suspend the use of California net operating loss deductions. We accounted for the effects of the California tax law change and we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $22.2 million due to a partial release of the valuation allowance on our California research and development tax credit deferred tax assets as a result of certain tax elections made in our 2019 California tax return.Our provision for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2020 income, partially offset by the tax benefit of $22.2 million related to the partial release of the valuation allowance on our California research and development tax credit deferred tax assets and the tax benefit of $60.1 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during fiscal 2020.During fiscal 2019, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary, which resulted in the establishment of a net deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $575.6 million. We expected to realize the deferred tax asset in future periods and did not provide for a valuation allowance. This income tax benefit was partially offset by the federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2019 income. We also recognized $36.8 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the year.Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. We currently expect that our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate will be approximately 14%. We expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources As ofChange January 2,2021December 28,20192020 vs. 2019 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$928.4 $705.2 $223.2 Net working capital681.8 497.0 184.8 Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of January 2, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $928.4 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $705.2 million as of December 28, 2019.Our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2020 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.Our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2020 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, repurchases of our common stock, payments on our revolving credit facility, payments for business combinations, net of cash acquired, and purchases of property, plant and equipment.36Table of Contents Approximately 61% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of January 2, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings. We expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.Net Working CapitalNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The increase in our net working capital as of January 2, 2021, as compared to December 28, 2019, is primarily due to improved results from operations, the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: Change 202020192020 vs. 2019 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$904.9 $729.6 $175.3 Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: Change 202020192020 vs. 2019 (In millions)Cash used for investing activities$(292.2)$(105.7)$(186.5)The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid in business combinations, net of cash acquired, and an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: Change 202020192020 vs. 2019 (In millions)Cash used for financing activities$(415.3)$(443.9)$28.6 The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in net cash paid for debt arrangements, partially offset by an increase in payments for repurchases of our common stock.37Table of ContentsOther Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Repurchase ProgramAt the end of fiscal 2019, approximately $369 million remained available under our previously announced authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock. In July 2020, Cadence’s Board of Directors increased the previously announced authorization to repurchase shares of Cadence common stock by an additional $750 million. The actual timing and amount of repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. As of January 2, 2021, approximately $739 million remained available to repurchase shares of Cadence common stock. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information.Revolving Credit FacilityOur senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $350.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million. The credit facility expires on January 28, 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on January 28, 2022. Outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. As of January 2, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility.2024 NotesIn October 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. As of January 2, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 Notes.For additional information relating to our debt arrangements, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Contractual ObligationsA summary of our contractual obligations as of January 2, 2021 is as follows:Payments Due by PeriodTotalLessThan 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMoreThan 5 Years(In millions)Operating lease obligations(1)$173.5 $38.4 $51.9 $35.6 $47.6 Purchase obligations46.8 36.3 8.7 1.3 0.5 Long-term debt350.0 — — 350.0 — Contractual interest payments61.8 15.8 30.7 15.3 — Current income tax payable7.8 7.8 Other long-term contractual obligations (2)40.4 — 19.8 4.0 16.6 Total$680.3 $98.3 $111.1 $406.2 $64.7 _________________(1) This table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of January 2, 2021 as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of January 2, 2021.(2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $17.6 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. Of the $17.6 million, we estimate $16.3 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years, $1.2 million within 3 to 5 years and $0.1 million in more than 5 years. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of January 2, 2021, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.38Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or IP licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. These contracts require us to apply judgement in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition. Determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. In some arrangements, such as most of our IP license arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. In other arrangements, like our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. Our time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation.Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”) for each distinct performance obligation. We rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the SSP for each performance obligation. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the SSP.Revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses, updates, and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations. For our professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. For our other performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized using a time-based measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term.If a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.We are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.Accounting for Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.39We only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.During fiscal 2019, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary, which resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $575.6 million. To determine the value of the deferred tax asset, we were required to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of the transferred IP rights. These estimates included, but are not limited to, the income and cash flows that the IP rights are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate discount rate to apply to the income and cash flow projections, and the useful lives of the IP rights. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, it would impact the fair value of the IP rights and the related value of the deferred tax asset and the income tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2019 and in future periods when the deferred tax asset is realized. In addition, we reviewed the need to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of $575.6 million by evaluating whether there is a greater than 50% likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make significant estimates and predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. We give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. Based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence, we concluded that it is greater than 50% likely that the deferred tax asset of $575.6 million will be realized in future periods and that a valuation allowance was not currently required. If, in the future, we evaluate that this deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized, an increase in the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax expense in the period such a determination is made.Business CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we acquired intangible assets of $101.3 million with our acquisition of AWR and Integrand. The fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets acquired with these acquisitions was determined using variations of the income approach. For existing technology, the fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset. To estimate royalty savings over time, we projected revenue from existing technology over the estimated remaining life of the technology, including the effect of technological obsolescence which was estimated at rate between 5% and 7.5% annually, before applying an assumed royalty rate of 20%. The present value of after-tax royalty savings were determined using discount rates ranging from 10% to 11.5%.The fair value for customer contracts and related relationships was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. Projected income from existing customer relationships considered customer retention rates ranging between 85% and 95%. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customer was determined using discount rates 10% and 11.5%.40We also assumed obligations related to deferred revenue of $6.9 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with our acquisition of AWR. The fair value of these obligations was estimated using the cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value using estimates of the costs required to fulfill the contracted obligations plus an assumed profit margin, which approximates the amount that AWR would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation.Cadence believes that its estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of its acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.New Accounting StandardsFor additional information about the adoption of new accounting standards, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.41Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activities are transacted in the U.S. dollar. In certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in U.S. dollars, a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets.In certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency, our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of January 2, 2021. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured during February 2021.NotionalPrincipalWeightedAverageContractRate (In millions) Forward Contracts:European Union euro$133.0 0.84 British pound103.2 0.75 Israeli shekel68.4 3.34 Japanese yen31.0 103.96 Swedish krona29.9 8.49 Chinese renminbi24.4 6.59 Indian rupee27.4 74.57 Taiwan dollar14.8 28.02 Canadian dollar7.9 1.3Other 6.6 N/ATotal$446.6 Estimated fair value$8.9 We actively monitor our foreign currency risks, but our foreign currency hedging activities may not substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.42Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and balances outstanding on our revolving credit facility, if any. We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of January 2, 2021.Interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable, so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Interest rates for our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of January 2, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. For an additional description of the revolving credit facility, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Equity Price RiskEquity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us.

813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewWe enable our customers to develop electronic products. Our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of ICs, SoCs, and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. Our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market, improving engineering productivity and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. We offer software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks, which are commonly referred to as IP.Our strategy, which we call Intelligent System Design, is to provide the technology necessary for our customers to develop electronic products across a variety of vertical markets including consumer, hyperscale computing, mobile, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. Our products and services enable our customers to develop complex and innovative electronic products, so demand for our technology is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as EDA. Today, our offerings include and extend beyond EDA.We group our products into categories related to major design activities:•Custom IC Design and Simulation;•Digital IC Design and Signoff;•Functional Verification;•IP; and•System Design and Analysis.28Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2021, we continued to execute our Intelligent System Design strategy with our announcement of the next generation of hardware-software products in our Functional Verification product category, which consists of the integrated Palladium Z2 emulation and Protium X2 prototyping systems, to accelerate hardware debug and software validation. We also completed our acquisitions of Belgium-based NUMECA, a leader in computational fluid dynamics (“CFD”), and Pointwise Inc, a leading provider of CFD Meshing technology. The addition of these technologies and talent broadens our System Design and Analysis portfolio and expertise. These acquisitions increased expenses, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, more than revenue during fiscal 2021.For additional information about our products, see the discussion in Item 1, “Business,” under the heading “Products and Product Strategy.”Management uses certain performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we offered a voluntary retirement program to eligible employees in the United States. This program resulted in a one-time charge for voluntary termination and post-employment benefits of $26.8 million. As of January 1, 2022, liabilities related to the voluntary retirement program were $17.5 million and were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to make cash payments to settle these liabilities through fiscal 2023, including $17.0 million that is expected to be paid in the next twelve months.COVID-19 ImpactIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The effects of the ongoing global pandemic have been widespread and have resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business limitations and shutdowns. We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and the distribution, acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines. Our efforts to comply with these containment measures have impacted our day-to-day operations and could disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our key customers, suppliers (including contract manufacturers) and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, a vast majority of our employees are still working remotely as of January 1, 2022. However, we have begun a limited pilot program for employees to begin voluntarily returning to work in certain jurisdictions with lower rates of new COVID-19 cases and higher vaccination rates.Since its inception, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused some volatility in our delivery timing for our hardware and IP products to certain customers. Many of our customers’ employees are working remotely, and, in some cases, we have experienced delivery lead times that are longer than normal because of delays in getting access to customer sites to complete our deliveries. In other cases, the amount of our hardware and IP products that we have been able to deliver has been greater than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the respective period. Despite the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has posed to our operations, it did not have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows during fiscal 2021. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information on the impact of COVID-19 on our business.Results of OperationsThe discussion of our fiscal 2021 consolidated results of operations include year-over-year comparisons to fiscal 2020 for revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other non-operating expenses, income taxes and cash flows. For a discussion of the fiscal 2020 changes compared to fiscal 2019, see the discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021, filed on February 22, 2021.Our fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2021 was a 52-week fiscal year, compared to 2020, which was a 53-week fiscal year. The additional week in fiscal 2020 resulted in additional revenue of approximately $45 million and additional expense, including stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles, of approximately $35 million.Results of operations for fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, reflect the following:•revenue growth that exceeded the growth of our costs and expenses;•increased product and maintenance revenue, primarily from growth in our software and hardware product offerings; •continued investment in research and development activities focused on expanding and enhancing our product portfolio; and•higher selling costs, including additional investment in technical sales support in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements.29Table of ContentsRevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.In any fiscal year, we expect that between 85% and 90% of our annual revenue will be characterized as recurring revenue. Revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our IP Access Agreements that include non-cancellable commitments from customers. The remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual IP licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue and fluctuations in revenue within our geographies are impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers in any single fiscal period.Revenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2021 and 2020 and the change in revenue between years: Change 202120202021 vs. 2020 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$2,812.9 $2,536.6 $276.3 11 %Services175.3 146.3 29.0 20 %Total revenue$2,988.2 $2,682.9 $305.3 11 %Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily because of increased revenue from each of our five product categories. This growth is driven by our customers investing in new, complex designs for their products including electronic systems for consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. Services revenue increased during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the timing of performance obligations being fulfilled for certain customer contracts during fiscal 2021. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and IP performance obligations.No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2021 or 2020.Revenue by Product CategoryThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product categories and services during fiscal 2021 and 2020: 20212020Custom IC Design and Simulation23 %25 %Digital IC Design and Signoff29 %29 %Functional Verification, including Emulation and Prototyping Hardware24 %22 %IP13 %14 %System Design and Analysis11 %10 %Total100 %100 %Revenue by product category fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services, our available resources and our ability to deliver and support them. Certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product categories based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. 30Table of Contents Revenue by Geography Change 202120202021 vs. 2020 (In millions, except percentages)United States$1,293.0 $1,096.3 $196.7 18 %Other Americas42.1 43.6 (1.5)(3)%China378.1 406.6 (28.5)(7)%Other Asia566.8 487.4 79.4 16 %Europe, Middle East and Africa523.4 469.8 53.6 11 %Japan184.8 179.2 5.6 3 %Total revenue$2,988.2 $2,682.9 $305.3 11 %The increase in revenue in the United States and Other Asia during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was attributable to growth in revenue from each of our five product categories.The decrease in revenue in China during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was due to higher-than-typical volume in China during fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2020, we experienced an increase in demand for our emulation and prototyping hardware and IP product offerings from our customers in China that resulted in a larger percentage of total revenue coming from that geography.The increase in revenue in Europe, Middle East and Africa during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was attributable to growth in revenue from System Design and Analysis, Digital IC Design and Custom IC Design product offerings.Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue 20212020United States43 %41 %Other Americas2 %1 %China13 %15 %Other Asia19 %18 %Europe, Middle East and Africa17 %18 %Japan6 %7 %Total100 %100 %Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar.

Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period, but is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, license third-party technology or IP, and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed technology or IP.A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2021 and 2020 is as follows: Change 202120202021 vs. 2020 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$175.0 $184.8 $(9.8)(5)%Amortization of acquired intangibles47.6 46.2 1.4 3 %Total cost of product and maintenance$222.6 $231.0 $(8.4)(4)%Product and maintenance-related costs decreased during fiscal 2021, when compared to fiscal 2020, due to the following: Change 2021 vs. 2020 (In millions)Emulation and prototyping hardware costs$(12.3)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs2.6 Other items(0.1)Total change in product and maintenance-related costs$(9.8)Costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components, assembly, testing, applicable reserves and overhead. These costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products. The decrease in emulation and prototyping hardware costs during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was primarily due to the mix of products generating revenue and a decrease in charges related to previous generations of our emulation hardware. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to technology-related intangible assets acquired with our acquisitions of NUMECA and Pointwise during the first half of fiscal 2021 and in-process technology being placed into service during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. This increase was partially offset by certain technology-related intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2021 and during fiscal 2020.Cost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization. Cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects rather than internal development projects.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, our annual merit cycle, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other employment separation activities (such as the voluntary retirement program), foreign exchange rate movements, volatility in variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results and charitable donations. Many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”32Table of ContentsOur operating expenses for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Change 202120202021 vs. 2020 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$560.3 $516.5 $43.8 8 %Research and development1,134.3 1,033.7 100.6 10 %General and administrative189.0 154.4 34.6 22 %Total operating expenses$1,883.6 $1,704.6 $179.0 11 %Our operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 20212020Marketing and sales19 %19 %Research and development38 %39 %General and administrative6 %6 %Total operating expenses63 %64 % Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2021 vs. 2020 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$35.2 Voluntary retirement program6.7 Professional services3.8 Home office-related expenses(2.0)Other items0.1 Total change in marketing and sales expense$43.8 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions and increased variable compensation. This increase was partially offset by reduced home office-related expenses associated with the transition to a remote work environment during fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Research and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2021 vs. 2020 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$75.9 Voluntary retirement program14.7 Facilities and other infrastructure costs7.7 Stock-based compensation6.2 Professional services2.7 Home office-related costs(5.3)Other items(1.3)Total change in research and development expense$100.6 33Table of ContentsSalary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in research and development expense increased during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio. This increase was partially offset by reduced home office-related expenses associated with the transition to a remote work environment during fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.General and AdministrativeThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2021 vs. 2020 (In millions)Contributions to non-profit organizations$15.0 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs5.9 Stock-based compensation4.5 Professional services3.2 Voluntary retirement program2.2 Other items3.8 Total change in general and administrative expense$34.6 The increase in contributions to non-profit organizations is the result of our continued commitment to support charitable initiatives. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we launched the Cadence Giving Foundation, a stand-alone, non-profit organization that was established to partner with other charitable initiatives to give back to the communities where we live and work. The Cadence Giving Foundation will also support critical needs in areas such as diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental sustainability and STEM education.Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in general and administrative expense increased during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions.Amortization of Acquired IntangiblesAmortization of acquired intangibles consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks and patents. Amortization in any given period depends primarily on the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets. Change 202120202021 vs. 2020 (In millions, except percentages)Amortization of acquired intangibles$19.6 $18.0 $1.6 9 %Amortization of acquired intangibles increased during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to intangibles assets acquired from Pointwise and Numeca during fiscal 2021. Restructuring We have initiated restructuring plans in recent years, most recently in fiscal 2020, to better align our resources with our business strategy. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. For additional information about our restructuring plans, see Note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Operating marginOperating margin represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue. Our operating margin for fiscal 2021 and 2020 was as follows:20212020Operating margin26 %24 %Operating margin increased during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily because revenue growth in each of our five product categories exceeded growth in operating expenses.34Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseInterest expense for fiscal 2021 and 2020 was comprised of the following: 20212020 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense:2024 Notes$15.3 $15.5 Revolving credit facility0.7 4.4 Amortization of debt discount:2024 Notes0.8 0.8 Other0.2 — Total interest expense$17.0 $20.7 Interest expense decreased during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a decrease in outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit facility. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we had outstanding borrowings of $350 million under our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to provide additional liquidity in light of global economic uncertainty that was present at that time. All outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. For an additional description of our debt arrangements, including our revolving credit facility, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 and 2020: 20212020 (In millions, except percentages)Provision for income taxes$72.5 $42.1 Effective tax rate9.4 %6.7 %Our provision for fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2021 income, partially offset by the tax benefit of $22.1 million related to our foreign-derived intangible income, and the tax benefit of $64.3 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the period. We also recognized a tax benefit of $10.5 million related to the release of the valuation allowance on our Massachusetts R&D tax credits because we expect to utilize these tax credits prior to expiration based on strong current earnings and future taxable income projections.Our provision for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2020 income, partially offset by the tax benefit of $22.2 million related to the partial release of the valuation allowance on our California R&D tax credit deferred tax assets and the tax benefit of $60.1 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during fiscal 2020.The United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 that requires companies to capitalize all of their R&D costs, including software development costs, incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Beginning in fiscal 2022, we must capitalize and amortize R&D costs over five years for domestic research and 15 years for international research rather than expensing these costs as incurred. If the United States doesn’t repeal or defer the effective date of the law in the future, then we expect our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate and our cash tax payments to increase significantly as compared to fiscal 2021. We also expect to recognize increases to our deferred tax assets as we begin to capitalize domestic research costs.Our future effective tax rates may also be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. We currently expect that our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. We expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.35Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources As ofChange January 1,2022January 2,20212021 vs. 2020 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$1,088.9 $928.4 $160.5 Net working capital744.5 681.8 62.7 Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of January 1, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1,088.9 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $928.4 million as of January 2, 2021.Our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2021 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.Our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2021 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, repurchases of our common stock, payments for business combinations, net of cash acquired, payments for income taxes, purchases of inventory, payment of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock and purchases of property, plant and equipment. Approximately 55% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of January 1, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings.Net Working CapitalNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The increase in our net working capital as of January 1, 2022, as compared to January 2, 2021, is primarily due to improved results from operations, the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Change 202120202021 vs. 2020 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$1,101.0 $904.9 $196.1 Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was primarily due to improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesCash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Change 202120202021 vs. 2020 (In millions)Cash used for investing activities$(293.0)$(292.2)$(0.8)Cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, consisted primarily of cash paid in business combinations, net of cash acquired, and payments for purchases of property, plant and equipment. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments.36Table of ContentsCash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Change 202120202021 vs. 2020 (In millions)Cash used for financing activities$(643.8)$(415.3)$(228.5)The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was primarily due to an increase in payments for repurchases of our common stock.Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Repurchase ProgramAs of the end of fiscal 2020, approximately $739 million remained available under the previously announced authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock. In August 2021, our Board of Directors increased the prior authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock by authorizing an additional $1 billion. The actual timing and amount of repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. As of January 1, 2022, approximately $1.1 billion remained available to repurchase shares of our common stock. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information.Revolving Credit FacilityOn June 30, 2021, we terminated our then-existing revolving credit facility, dated January 30, 2017, and entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “2021 Credit Facility”). The 2021 Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to $700.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $350.0 million upon receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $1.05 billion. The 2021 Credit Facility expires on June 30, 2026. Any outstanding loans drawn under the 2021 Credit Facility are due at maturity on June 30, 2026, subject to an option to extend the maturity date. Outstanding borrowings may be repaid at any time prior to maturity. As of January 1, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with such credit facility.2024 NotesIn October 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. As of January 1, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 Notes.For additional information relating to our debt arrangements, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Other Liquidity RequirementsA summary of other capital and liquidity requirements as of January 1, 2022 is as follows:TotalDue in LessThan 1 Year(In millions)Operating lease obligations(1)$171.1 $32.0 Purchase obligations62.4 50.9 Contractual interest payments48.7 15.9 Voluntary retirement program17.5 17.0 Income tax payable8.0 8.0 Other long-term contractual obligations (2)47.9 — Total$355.6 $123.8 _________________(1) This table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of January 1, 2022 as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of January 1, 2022.(2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $23.1 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.37Table of Contents We expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of January 1, 2022, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our operating results or financial condition.Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or IP licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. These contracts require us to apply judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition. Determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. In some arrangements, such as most of our IP license arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. In other arrangements, like our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. Our time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation.Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”) for each distinct performance obligation. We rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the SSP for each performance obligation. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the SSP.Revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses, updates, and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations. For our professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. For our other performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized using a time-based measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term.If a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.We are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.38Table of ContentsAccounting for Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations. We only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.During fiscal 2019, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary, which resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $575.6 million. To determine the value of the deferred tax asset, we were required to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of the transferred IP rights. These estimates included, but are not limited to, the income and cash flows that the IP rights are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate discount rate to apply to the income and cash flow projections, and the useful lives of the IP rights. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, it would impact the fair value of the IP rights and the related value of the deferred tax asset and the income tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2019 and in future periods when the deferred tax asset is realized. In addition, we reviewed the need to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of $575.6 million by evaluating whether there is a greater than 50% likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make significant estimates and predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. We give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. Based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence, we concluded that it is greater than 50% likely that the deferred tax asset of $575.6 million will be realized in future periods and that a valuation allowance was not currently required. If, in the future, we evaluate that this deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized, an increase in the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax expense in the period such a determination is made.Business CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.During fiscal 2021, we acquired intangible assets of $88.9 million with our acquisition of NUMECA and Pointwise. The fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets acquired with these acquisitions was determined using variations of the income approach.39Table of ContentsFor acquired existing technology, the fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset. To estimate royalty savings over time, we projected revenue from the acquired existing technology over the estimated remaining life of the technology, including the effect of assumed technological obsolescence, before applying an assumed royalty rate. For NUMECA, we assumed technological obsolescence at a rate of 6.7% annually, before applying an assumed royalty rate of 22%. For Pointwise, we assumed technological obsolescence at a rate of 10.0% annually, before applying an assumed royalty rate of 25%. The present value of after-tax royalty savings were determined using discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 12.0%.The fair value for acquired agreements and relationships was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. Projected income from existing customer relationships considered a customer retention rate of 95% for both NUMECA and Pointwise. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 12.0%.We believe that our estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of its acquired intangible assets are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.New Accounting StandardsFor additional information about the adoption of new accounting standards, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.40Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activities are transacted in the U.S. dollar. In certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in U.S. dollars, a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets.In certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency, our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of January 1, 2022. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured during February, 2022.NotionalPrincipalWeightedAverageContractRate (In millions) Forward Contracts:European Union euro$140.8 0.88 British pound104.3 0.74 Israeli shekel84.1 3.10 Japanese yen57.5 114.50 Indian rupee29.4 75.23 Swedish krona22.3 9.01 Canadian dollar11.7 1.26 Chinese renminbi7.3 6.43 Taiwan dollar5.6 27.62Other 6.4 N/ATotal$469.4 Estimated fair value$(0.3)We actively monitor our foreign currency risks, but our foreign currency hedging activities may not substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.41Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and balances outstanding on our revolving credit facility, if any. We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges.All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of January 1, 2022.Interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable, so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Interest rates for our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Assuming all loans were fully drawn and we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $2.6 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. As of January 1, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. For an additional description of the revolving credit facility, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Equity Price RiskEquity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments.",2023-12-30 20:46:27.149802
813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business OverviewCadence is a leader in electronic system design, building upon more than 30 years of computational software expertise. We apply our underlying Intelligent System Design strategy to deliver computational software, hardware and IP that turn design concepts into reality. We enable our customers to develop electronic products. Our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of integrated ICs, SoCs, and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. Our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market, improving engineering productivity and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs.Our strategy is to provide the technology necessary for our customers to develop products across a variety of vertical markets including consumer, hyperscale computing, mobile, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial, healthcare and life sciences. Our products and services enable our customers to develop complex and innovative electronic products, so demand for our technology is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as Electronic Design Automation (“EDA”). Today, our offerings include and extend beyond EDA.We group our products into categories related to major design activities:•Custom IC Design and Simulation;•Digital IC Design and Signoff;•Functional Verification;•IP; and•System Design and Analysis.28Table of ContentsConsistent with our Intelligent System Design strategy, we completed our acquisitions of OpenEye and Future Facilities during fiscal 2022. Both of these acquisitions are expected to add important new technologies and capabilities to our System Design and Analysis technology portfolio that we believe will enhance our ability to pursue attractive opportunities in the markets we serve. During fiscal 2022, these acquisitions increased expenses, including amortization of acquired intangible assets more than revenue.For additional information about our products, see the discussion in Item 1, “Business,” under the heading “Products and Product Categories.”Management uses certain performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Fiscal Year EndOn September 7, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year to December 31 of each year. Our fiscal quarters will end on March 31, June 30, and September 30. The fiscal year change is effective beginning with our 2023 fiscal year, which began on January 1, 2023.Macroeconomic EnvironmentOur business is subject to the effects of expanded trade restrictions, the ongoing geopolitical conflict in Ukraine and other areas of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, global inflation and the rise in interest rates. We have been impacted by expanded trade restrictions, including restrictions concerning advanced node IC production in China, the inclusion of additional Chinese technology companies on the BIS’s “Unverified List” and regulations governing the sale of certain technologies. Based on our current assessments, we expect the impact of these expanded trade restrictions on our business to be limited. We also continuously monitor geopolitical conflicts around the world and their effects on our business. During the first half of fiscal 2022, due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the corresponding sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, we terminated our operations in Russia. The termination of our operations in Russia has not limited our ability to develop or support our products and has not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. We do not have operations or employees in Ukraine.Since its inception, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a variety of challenges to our day-to-day operations. Despite these challenges, the pandemic has not had a material, adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 and its continuing repercussions will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, we have implemented policies and practices that have enabled us to support critical operations and execute our strategy. While our business model provides some resilience against these factors, we will continue to monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these or similar circumstances on our business and financial results. For additional information on the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Results of OperationsThe discussion of our fiscal 2022 consolidated results of operations include year-over-year comparisons to fiscal 2021 for revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other non-operating expenses, income taxes and cash flows. For a discussion of the fiscal 2021 changes compared to fiscal 2020, see the discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022, filed on February 22, 2022.Results of operations for fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, reflect the following:•revenue growth that exceeded the growth of our costs and expenses;•increased revenue from software, IP and other arrangements where revenue is recognized over time;•growth in revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware and IP where revenue is recognized up-front;•continued investment in research and development activities and technical sales support; and•increased provision for income taxes primarily due to changes to tax laws in the United States.RevenueWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.29Table of ContentsGenerally, between 85% and 90% of our annual revenue is characterized as recurring revenue. Recurring revenue includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. Recurring revenue also includes revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of other arrangements with non-cancelable commitments, whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of products or services. The remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual IP licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue and fluctuations in revenue within our geographies are impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers in any single fiscal period. The following table shows the percentage of our revenue that is classified as recurring or up-front for fiscal 2022 and 2021: 20222021Revenue recognized over time83 %85 %Revenue from arrangements with non-cancelable commitments2 %3 %Recurring revenue85 %88 %Up-front revenue15 %12 %Total100 %100 %While the percentage of revenue characterized as recurring compared to revenue characterized as up-front may vary between fiscal quarters, the overall mix of revenue is relatively consistent on an annual basis or over the course of twelve consecutive months. The following table shows the percentage of recurring revenue for the twelve-month periods ending concurrently with our five most recent fiscal quarters: Trailing Twelve Months Ended December 31,2022October 1,2022July 2,2022April 2,2022January 1,2022Recurring revenue85 %86 %87 %87 %88 %Up-front revenue15 %14 %13 %13 %12 %Total100 %100 %100 %100 %100 %Revenue by YearThe following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2022 and 2021 and the change in revenue between years: Change 202220212022 vs. 2021 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance$3,340.2 $2,812.9 $527.3 19 %Services221.5 175.3 46.2 26 %Total revenue$3,561.7 $2,988.2 $573.5 19 %Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to increased revenue in each of our five product categories. This growth was driven by our customers investing in new, complex designs for their products that include the design of electronic systems for consumer, hyperscale computing, mobile, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. Services revenue increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to increased revenue from our custom IP offerings. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and IP performance obligations.No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2022 or 2021.30Table of ContentsRevenue by Product CategoryThe following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product categories and services during fiscal 2022 and 2021: 20222021Custom IC Design and Simulation22 %23 %Digital IC Design and Signoff28 %29 %Functional Verification, including Emulation and Prototyping Hardware26 %24 %IP12 %13 %System Design and Analysis12 %11 %Total100 %100 %Revenue by product category fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services, our available resources and our ability to deliver and support them. Certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product categories based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ.

Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period, but is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, license third-party technology or IP, and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed technology or IP.A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2022 and 2021 is as follows: Change 202220212022 vs. 2021 (In millions, except percentages)Product and maintenance-related costs$232.3 $175.0 $57.3 33 %Amortization of acquired intangibles41.3 47.6 (6.3)(13)%Total cost of product and maintenance$273.6 $222.6 $51.0 23 %Product and maintenance-related costs increased during fiscal 2022, when compared to fiscal 2021, due to the following: Change 2022 vs. 2021 (In millions)Emulation and prototyping hardware costs$51.6 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs4.9 Other items0.8 Total change in product and maintenance-related costs$57.3 Costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components, assembly, testing, applicable reserves and overhead. These costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products. The increase in emulation and prototyping hardware costs during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to increased revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware products.Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance decreased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to certain technology-related intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2022 and during fiscal 2021, partially offset by technology-related intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2022.32Table of ContentsCost of ServicesCost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization. Cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects rather than internal development projects.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expense. Factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, our annual mid-year promotion and pay raise cycle, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other employment separation activities, foreign exchange rate movements, acquisition-related costs, volatility in variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results, and charitable donations. During fiscal 2021, we offered a voluntary retirement program to eligible employees in the United States. This program resulted in a one-time charge for voluntary termination and post-employment benefits of $26.8 million. As of December 31, 2022, liabilities related to the voluntary retirement program were $0.4 million and were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to make cash payments to settle these liabilities during fiscal 2023.Many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.”Our operating expenses for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Change 202220212022 vs. 2021 (In millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$604.2 $560.3 $43.9 8 %Research and development1,251.6 1,134.3 117.3 10 %General and administrative242.1 189.0 53.1 28 %Total operating expenses$2,097.9 $1,883.6 $214.3 11 %Our operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 20222021Marketing and sales17 %19 %Research and development35 %38 %General and administrative7 %6 %Total operating expenses59 %63 %33Table of Contents Marketing and SalesThe changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2022 vs. 2021 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$24.0 Stock-based compensation11.5 Marketing programs and events9.9 Facilities and other infrastructure costs3.9 Travel and sales meetings3.3 Professional services(3.2)Voluntary retirement program(6.7)Other items1.2 Total change in marketing and sales expense$43.9 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs and stock-based compensation included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to increased business levels and our continued investment in attracting and retaining talent dedicated to technical sales support. Costs related to marketing programs and events increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increased number of in-person meetings and events.Research and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2022 vs. 2021 (In millions)Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs$76.6 Stock-based compensation27.7 Facilities and other infrastructure costs11.5 Professional services9.3 Travel5.2 Voluntary retirement program(14.7)Other items1.7 Total change in research and development expense$117.3 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs and stock-based compensation included in research and development expense increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to our continued investment in attracting and retaining talent for research and development activities. Facilities and other infrastructure costs increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with our acquisitions and our growing work force.34Table of ContentsGeneral and AdministrativeThe changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2022 vs. 2021 (In millions)Stock-based compensation$20.0 Professional services15.2 Legal fees and related costs12.5 Contributions to non-profit organizations8.7 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs8.5 Voluntary retirement program(2.6)Foreign service tax refund(13.5)Other items4.3 Total change in general and administrative expense$53.1 As a result of the transition of our Chief Executive Officer and creation of the Executive Chair role in December of 2021, general and administrative expense for fiscal 2022 includes incremental compensation costs, as compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in stock-based compensation included in general and administrative expense during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, is primarily due to equity awards granted to executives. Professional services and legal fees included in general and administrative expense increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increase in acquisition-related professional services, legal fees and costs for other matters. The increase in contributions to non-profit organizations during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, is primarily related to increased contributions to the Cadence Giving Foundation in an effort to give back to the communities where our employees live and work.During fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, we benefited from a non-recurring foreign service tax refund, offsetting the increase in other categories of general and administrative expense.Amortization of Acquired IntangiblesAmortization of acquired intangibles consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks and patents. Amortization in any given period depends primarily on the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets. Change 202220212022 vs. 2021 (In millions, except percentages)Amortization of acquired intangibles$18.5 $19.6 $(1.1)(6)%Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the first half of fiscal 2022 and during fiscal 2021, partially offset by intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2022.Operating marginOperating margin represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue. Our operating margin for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was as follows:20222021Operating margin30 %26 %Operating margin increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily because revenue growth in each of our five product categories exceeded growth in operating expenses.35Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseInterest expense for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was comprised of the following: 20222021 (In millions)Contractual cash interest expense:2024 Notes$15.3 $15.3 2025 Term Loan4.1 — Revolving credit facility2.8 0.7 Amortization of debt discount:2024 Notes0.9 0.8 Other(0.2)0.2 Total interest expense$22.9 $17.0 Interest expense increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to increased interest expense associated with amounts outstanding under our 2025 Term Loan and our 2021 Credit Facility. Interest rates under our 2025 Term Loan and 2021 Credit Facility are variable, so interest expense is affected by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings of $100.0 million under our 2021 Credit Facility to fund domestic working capital and for other general corporate requirements. For an additional description of our debt arrangements, including our 2025 Term Loan and 2021 Credit Facility, see Note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021: 20222021 (In millions, except percentages)Provision for income taxes$196.4 $72.5 Effective tax rate18.8 %9.4 %The United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, which requires companies to capitalize all of their R&D costs, including software development costs, incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Beginning in fiscal 2022, we began capitalizing and amortizing R&D costs over five years for domestic research and fifteen years for international research rather than expensing these costs as incurred. As a result, our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate and our cash tax payments increased significantly as compared to fiscal 2021. We recognized increases to our deferred tax assets as we begin to capitalize domestic research costs.Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2022 income, partially offset by the tax benefit of $42.1 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the period. We also recognized a tax benefit of $68.7 million related to the release of the valuation allowance on our California R&D tax credits because we expect to utilize these tax credits based on strong current earnings and future taxable income projections. Our provision for fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2021 income, partially offset by the tax benefit of $22.1 million related to our foreign-derived intangible income, and the tax benefit of $64.3 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the period. We also recognized a tax benefit of $10.5 million related to the release of the valuation allowance on our Massachusetts R&D tax credits because we expect to utilize these tax credits prior to expiration based on strong current earnings and future taxable income projections.We maintain valuation allowances on certain federal, state, and foreign deferred tax assets. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. In the event we determine that we will be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, the valuation allowance will be reversed in the period in which we make such determination. The release of a valuation allowance would result in an increase to our net deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense in the period in which the release is recorded. 36Table of ContentsOur future effective tax rates may also be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. We currently expect that our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate will be approximately 26%. We expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources As ofChange December 31,2022January 1,20222022 vs. 2021 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$882.3 $1,088.9 $(206.6)Net working capital359.1 744.5 (385.4)Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $882.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $1,088.9 million as of January 1, 2022.Our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2022 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from debt, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.Our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2022 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, repurchases of our common stock, payments for business combinations, net of cash acquired, payments for income taxes, purchases of inventory, payment of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock and purchases of property, plant and equipment. Approximately 76% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings. We expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows that are generated from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.Net Working CapitalNet working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in our net working capital as of December 31, 2022, as compared to January 1, 2022, is primarily due to our use of cash for investing and financing activities and the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Change 202220212022 vs. 2021 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$1,241.9 $1,101.0 $140.9 Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.37Table of ContentsCash Flows Used for Investing ActivitiesCash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Change 202220212022 vs. 2021 (In millions)Cash used for investing activities$(738.6)$(293.0)$(445.6)The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid in business combinations, net of cash acquired, and an increase in payments for purchases of property, plant and equipment. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, acquiring other companies and businesses, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments.Cash Flows Used for Financing ActivitiesCash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Change 202220212022 vs. 2021 (In millions)Cash used for financing activities$(657.0)$(643.8)$(13.2)The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to an increase in payments for repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from debt.Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Repurchase ProgramIn August 2022, our Board of Directors increased the prior authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock by authorizing an additional $1.0 billion. The actual timing and amount of repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $1.1 billion of the share repurchase authorization remained available to repurchase shares of our common stock. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information on share repurchases.Revolving Credit FacilityIn June 2021, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, as amended in September 2022 (the “2021 Credit Facility”). The 2021 Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to $700.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $350.0 million upon receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $1.05 billion. The 2021 Credit Facility expires on June 30, 2026. Any outstanding loans drawn under the 2021 Credit Facility are due at maturity on June 30, 2026, subject to an option to extend the maturity date. Outstanding borrowings may be repaid at any time prior to maturity. Interest rates associated with the 2021 Credit Facility are variable, so interest expense is impacted by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, there were $100.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with such credit facility.38Table of Contents2024 NotesIn October 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 Notes.2025 Term LoanIn September 2022, we entered into a $300.0 million three-year senior non-amortizing term loan facility due on September 7, 2025 with a group of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “2025 Term Loan”). The 2025 Term Loan is unsecured and ranks equal in right of payment to all of our unsecured indebtedness. Proceeds from the 2025 Term Loan were used to fund our acquisition of OpenEye. Interest rates associated with the 2025 Term Loan are variable, so interest expense is impacted by changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the 2025 Term Loan. For additional information relating to our debt arrangements, see Note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. For additional information relating to OpenEye and other acquisitions, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Other Liquidity RequirementsA summary of other capital and liquidity requirements as of December 31, 2022 is as follows:TotalDue in LessThan 1 Year(In millions)Operating lease obligations(1)$207.6 $41.4 Purchase obligations92.6 80.3 Contractual interest payments (2)73.6 31.9 Tax assessment (3)48.7 48.7 Income tax payable18.5 18.5 Other long-term contractual obligations (4)89.7 — Total$530.7 $220.8 _________________(1) This table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of December 31, 2022 as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of December 31, 2022.(2) Contractual interest payments on our variable rate indebtedness were calculated based on outstanding borrowings and the weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2022.(3) In 2022, we received a tax audit assessment from the Korea taxing authorities primarily related to value-added taxes for years 2017-2019. We are required to pay these assessed taxes, prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the assessment. We paid the assessment in January 2023. Payment of this amount is not an admission that we are subject to such taxes, and we continue to defend our position vigorously. (4) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $63 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.We expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our operating results or financial condition.39Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or IP licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. These contracts require us to apply judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition. Determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. In some arrangements, such as most of our IP license arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. In other arrangements, like our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. Our time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation.Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”) for each distinct performance obligation. We rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the SSP for each performance obligation. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the SSP.Revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses, updates, and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations. For our professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. For our other performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized using a time-based measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term.If a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.We are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.Accounting for Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations. 40Table of ContentsWe only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.Business CombinationsWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.During fiscal 2022, we acquired intangible assets of $178.6 million. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired was determined using variations of the income approach that utilizes unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 measurements.With our acquisitions of OpenEye and Future Facilities, we acquired combined intangible assets of $155.5 million. For existing technology acquired with OpenEye and Future Facilities, the fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset. To estimate royalty savings over time, we projected revenue from the acquired existing technology over the estimated remaining life of the technology, including the effect of assumed technological obsolescence, before applying an assumed royalty rate. For both OpenEye and Future Facilities, we assumed technological obsolescence at a rate of 10% annually, before applying an assumed royalty rate of 25%.The fair value for agreements and relationships acquired with our acquisitions of OpenEye and Future Facilities was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. Projected income from existing customer relationships was determined using customer retention rates between 95% and 100% for OpenEye and 95% for Future Facilities. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates ranging from 10% to 11%.We also completed three other business combinations with combined intangible assets of $23.1 million. The fair value of certain intangible assets acquired was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, a variation of the income approach that utilizes unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 measurements. This method estimates the revenue and cash flows derived from the acquired assets, net of investment in supporting assets. The resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the assets acquired, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the associated risk of the asset to calculate the present value. We assumed discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 24.5%. The fair value of the remaining intangible assets acquired was determined using the relief-from-royalty method using a technological obsolescence rate of approximately 12% annually, before applying a royalty rate of 25%.We believe that our estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of our acquired intangible assets are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.New Accounting StandardsFor additional information about the adoption of new accounting standards, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.41Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency RiskA material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activities are transacted in the U.S. dollar. In certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in U.S. dollars, a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets.In certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency, our revenue benefits from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenue from existing contracts.We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets.We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures, and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures.The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of December 31, 2022. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured during February 2023.NotionalPrincipalWeightedAverageContractRate (In millions) Forward Contracts:European union euro$139.5 0.95 British pound105.7 0.83 Japanese yen68.3 135.15 Israeli shekel58.5 3.42 Indian rupee35.9 81.84 Swedish krona26.4 10.35 Chinese renminbi18.2 6.99 Canadian dollar15.5 1.33 South Korean Won9.9 1,303.03 Taiwan dollar7.1 30.47 Singapore dollar4.0 1.37 Total$489.0 Estimated fair value$5.3 As of January 1, 2022, our foreign currency exchange contracts had an aggregate principal amount of $469.4 million, and an estimated fair value of negative $0.3 million.42Table of ContentsWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to applicable foreign currency exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at each respective date. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease to the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts of $4.2 million and $5.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, while a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in an increase to the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts of $7.2 million and $8.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively.We actively monitor our foreign currency risks, but our foreign currency hedging activities may not substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and any balances outstanding on our 2021 Credit Facility and 2025 Term Loan. We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges. All highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 31, 2022.Interest rates under our 2021 Credit Facility and 2025 Term Loan are variable, so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, there were $100.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our 2021 Credit Facility and $300.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our 2025 Term Loan. Interest rates for our 2021 Credit Facility and 2025 Term Loan can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in interest rate margins that vary based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. Assuming all loans were fully drawn and we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our 2021 Credit Facility and made no prepayments on our 2025 Term Loan, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $3.4 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our 2021 Credit Facility and 2025 Term Loan. For an additional description of the 2021 Credit Facility and 2025 Term Loan, see Note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Equity Price RiskEquity InvestmentsWe have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable investments. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us.

813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the extent and timing of future revenues and expenses and customer demand, statements regarding the deployment of our products, statements regarding our reliance on third parties and other statements using words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “should,” “will” and “would,” and words of similar import and the negatives thereof, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are predictions based upon our current expectations about future events. Actual results could vary materially as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those expressed in these statements. We refer you to the “Competition,” “Proprietary Technology,” “Risk Factors,” “Results of Operations,” “Disclosures About Market Risk” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections contained in this Annual Report and the risks discussed in our other SEC filings, which identify important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We urge you to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. All subsequent written or spoken forward-looking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report are made only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update these forward-looking statements. Overview We develop electronic design automation, or EDA, software and hardware. We license software, sell or lease hardware technology, provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide design and methodology services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics product development processes. Our broad range of products and services are used by the world’s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and personal and commercial electronics systems. 28 Table of Contents With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation steps. We combine our design technologies into “platforms” for four major design activities: functional verification, digital IC design, custom IC design and system interconnect. The four Cadence design platforms are Incisive functional verification, Encounter digital IC design, Virtuoso custom design and Allegro system interconnect platforms. In addition, we augment these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of DFM products that service both the digital and custom IC design flows. These four platforms, together with our DFM products, comprise our primary product lines. Functional verification was the fastest growing product group of our business in 2006, driven by our Incisive verification solutions. We offer a complete solution for verification management from planning to closure. During 2006, we also introduced a significant upgrade of our Virtuoso platform. An early adopter program for this platform helped stimulate demand. This release is the most significant upgrade to the custom product line in many years. Finally, in late 2006 we introduced the Logic Design Team solution, which combines technology from our Incisive verification and Encounter digital design platforms to create an integrated, front-end environment for logic designers. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items more fully below under the heading “Results of Operations” below. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes, restructuring charges and valuation of stock-based awards have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue recognition We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9, “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,” to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental. We also apply the provisions of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists. We license software using three different license types: • Subscription licenses; • Term licenses; and • Perpetual licenses. Subscription licenses – Our subscription license arrangements offer our customers the right to: • Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement, generally two to three years, with no rights to return; 29 Table of Contents • Use unspecified additional software products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement; and • Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other unspecified additional software products that may become available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software because all software products have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to use them. In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product. Subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance that was established in connection with the sale of our term licenses. Term licenses – Our term license arrangements offer our customers the right to: • Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement, generally two to three years, with no rights to return; and • Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software because all software products have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to use them. In general, revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product. Perpetual licenses – Our perpetual licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software. In general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement – Generally, we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does not exist, we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service projects, such as training classes and small methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other service engagements, we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement. Sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Product delivery – Software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of free-on-board, or F.O.B., shipping point. Our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point. Fee is fixed or determinable – We assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. We have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments, products or services. For our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment, we may only determine that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the 30 Table of Contents payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable. We must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Collection is probable – We assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the customer’s payment history and its current creditworthiness. We have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement, particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value – Our VSOE for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate VSOE. Finance fee revenue – Finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees are recognized using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented approximately 2% of total revenue for each of the years ended December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005. Upon the sale of an installment contract, we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract. Services revenue – Services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing design and methodology services. These services are not related to the functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. 31 Table of Contents Accounting for income taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense (benefit) is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from potential sources including tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus materially affecting our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Restructuring charges We account for restructuring charges in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, “Restructuring and Impairment Charges,” as amended. From fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2005, we undertook significant restructuring initiatives. All restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” and EITF No. 88-10, “Costs Associated with Lease Modifications or Terminations.” For restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002, we accounted for the leased facilities in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” In addition, for all periods presented, we accounted for the asset-related portions of these restructurings in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For all periods presented, the severance and benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, “Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits – An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43.” These restructuring initiatives have required us to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly estimating when, if at all, we will be able to sublet vacated facilities and, if we do, the sublease terms. Closure and space reduction costs that are part of our restructuring charges include payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities during the abandonment period. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our restructuring accrual, and adjust the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions. We may incur future charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded. Valuation of stock-based awards We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” Under SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected volatility of our stock, the expected term of stock options, the risk-free interest rate for the period, expected dividends and expected forfeitures. The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes pricing model for option grants is based on implied volatility calculated using an average of the volatility of publicly traded 32 Table of Contents options for our common stock and our 2023 Notes. We use this approach to determine volatility because options for our common stock are actively traded, the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee stock options, the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee stock options, and the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year. When establishing the expected life assumption, we review annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to option grants having similar vesting periods. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that we expect to be forfeited. We calculate a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock options and restricted stock issuances based on historical trends. The valuation of all options and the expected forfeiture rates for options and restricted stock are calculated based on one employee pool as there is no significant difference in exercise behavior between classes of employees. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected. Results of Operations We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design and methodology services. We principally utilize three license types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types provide a customer with different terms of use for our products, such as: • The right to access new technology; • The duration of the license; and • Payment terms. Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed term of use, this will result in either a subscription or term license. A business implication of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups, rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license. See the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates” above for an additional description of license types and timing of revenue recognition. A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over multiple periods. As a result, we do not believe that pricing volatility has been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period. The amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the terms and timing of our contract renewals or additional product sales with existing customers, the size of such transactions and sales to new customers. The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription, term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms. The timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements (e.g., subscription to term) with existing customers. Revenue and Revenue Mix We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into “platforms,” which are included in the various product groups described below. Our product groups are: Functional Verification: Products in this group, which include the Incisive functional verification platform, are used to verify that the high level, logical specification of an IC design is correct. 33 Table of Contents Digital IC Design: Products in this group, which include the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to accurately convert the high-level, logical specification of a digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the IC will be physically implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture. Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, which include the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for ICs that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, radio frequency, memories, high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries. Detailed design information showing how an IC will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture. System Interconnect: This product group consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro and OrCAD products. The Allegro system interconnect platform offering focuses on system interconnect design platform, which enables consistent co-design of ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions. Design for Manufacturing: Included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. Revenue by Year The following table shows our revenue for the fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 and the percentage change in revenue between years: % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In millions) Product $ 982.7 $ 851.5 $ 729.8 15% 17% Services 134.9 126.2 137.0 7% (8)% Maintenance 366.3 351.5 330.7 4% 6% Total revenue $ 1,483.9 $ 1,329.2 $ 1,197.5 12% 11% 2006 compared to 2005 Product revenue was higher in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Functional Verification and Custom IC Design products, partially offset by a small decrease in revenue from licenses for Design for Manufacturing products. Functional verification was the fastest growing platform in 2006. Services revenue increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to an increase in utilization and realization rates for our services personnel. 2005 compared to 2004 Product revenue was higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital IC Design, Functional Verification and Custom IC products. Services revenue was lower in 2005, as compared to 2004, due to our reduced capacity to satisfy demand for our design services after having implemented certain restructuring activities. 34 Table of Contents Revenue by Product Group The following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups, and Services and other in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 Functional Verification 24% 21% 17% Digital IC Design 24% 28% 25% Custom IC Design 27% 25% 27% System Interconnect 9% 8% 9% Design for Manufacturing 7% 9% 9% Services and other 9% 9% 13% Total 100% 100% 100% As described under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates” above, certain of our licenses allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have licensed a combination of our products to customers with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and therefore the revenue allocated in the above table may differ. Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement. However, during the term of the arrangement, we reevaluate the allocation of revenue based on actual deployment of our products. The decrease in percentage of Services and other in 2005, as compared to 2004, is primarily due to $11.0 million of revenue recognized from the sale of IP in 2004. This sale of IP in 2004 is included in Services and other in the preceding table and in Product revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. Revenue by Geography % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In millions) United States $ 765.1 $ 613.2 $ 598.9 25% 2% Other North America 31.3 20.3 27.0 54% (25)% Europe 284.4 245.0 261.9 16% (6)% Japan 247.9 333.2 191.2 (26)% 74% Asia 155.2 117.5 118.5 32% (1)% Total revenue $ 1,483.9 $ 1,329.2 $ 1,197.5 12% 11% Revenue by Geography as a Percentage of Total Revenue 2006 2005 2004 United States 52% 46% 50% Other North America 2% 2% 2% Europe 19% 18% 22% Japan 17% 25% 16% Asia 10% 9% 10% Total revenue 100% 100% 100% 35 Table of Contents The rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those regions. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2006, 2005 or 2004. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to fluctuations of the Japanese yen in relation to the United States dollar, caused our revenue to decrease by $12.0 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, and to decrease by $5.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004. Additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock-based Compensation Expense Summary We adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, which resulted in an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $64.1 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Stock-based compensation expense is reflected throughout our costs and expenses in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Cost of product $ 0.2 $ ---- $ 0.1 Cost of services 4.0 0.6 1.4 Cost of maintenance 2.5 0.4 0.9 Marketing and sales 23.9 9.1 7.5 Research and development 50.9 19.3 17.1 General and administrative 22.5 10.5 4.4 Total $ 104.0 $ 39.9 $ 31.4 Cost of Revenue % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In millions) Product $ 66.8 $ 79.7 $ 82.0 (16)% (3)% Services $ 96.5 $ 91.9 $ 91.0 5% 1% Maintenance $ 63.8 $ 59.8 $ 53.1 7% 13% Cost of Revenue as a Percentage of Related Revenue 2006 2005 2004 Product 7% 9% 11% Services 72% 73% 66% Maintenance 17% 17% 16% Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to Cadence products, the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials, assembly labor and overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software product. A summary of Cost of product in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Product related costs $ 33.6 $ 29.1 $ 38.0 Amortization of acquired intangibles 33.2 50.6 44.0 Total Cost of product $ 66.8 $ 79.7 $ 82.0 36 Table of Contents 2006 compared to 2005 Cost of product decreased $12.9 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • A decrease of $17.4 million in amortization of acquired intangibles due to the full amortization of certain acquired intangibles; partially offset by • An increase of $5.3 million in hardware costs attributable to increased hardware sales. Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period. Assuming no changes to our current portfolio of intangibles, we expect the Amortization of acquired intangibles component of Cost of product to continue decreasing as the amortization periods assigned upon the purchase of certain intangibles are completed. Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services increased $4.6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to: • An increase of $3.4 million in stock-based compensation expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; and • An increase of $1.2 million in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs. Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs for certain employees, and documentation of maintenance updates. Cost of maintenance increased $4.0 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to: • An increase of $2.1 million in stock-based compensation due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; and • An increase of $1.0 million in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs. 2005 compared to 2004 Cost of product decreased $2.3 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to: • A decrease of $13.5 million in the cost of hardware products sold as a result of sales of products with lower costs; partially offset by • An increase of $6.6 million in amortization of intangibles due to an increase in acquired intangibles associated with our acquisition of Verisity; and • An increase of $1.6 million in royalty expenses. Cost of services increased $0.9 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to: • An increase of $3.2 million in salary and benefits costs; partially offset by • A decrease of $1.5 million in other operating expenses; and • A decrease of $0.8 million in stock-based compensation. Cost of maintenance increased $6.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to: • An increase of $3.7 million in salary and benefit costs; and • An increase of $3.1 million in amortization of intangible assets. Operating Expenses % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In millions) Marketing and sales $ 405.6 $ 366.2 $ 333.1 11% 10% Research and development 460.1 390.7 368.1 18% 6% General and administrative 143.3 129.6 87.9 11% 47% Total operating expenses $ 1,009.0 $ 886.5 $ 789.1 14% 12% 37 Table of Contents Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Total Revenue 2006 2005 2004 Marketing and sales 27% 28% 28% Research and development 31% 29% 31% General and administrative 10% 10% 7% Operating Expense Summary 2006 compared to 2005 Overall operating expenses increased $122.5 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $58.4 million in stock-based compensation expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; and • An increase of $49.2 million in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, primarily due to an increased number of employees and increases in bonus and commission costs, in part due to our acquisition of Verisity Ltd., or Verisity, in the second quarter of 2005. 2005 compared to 2004 Operating expenses increased $97.4 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to: • An increase of $63.3 million in employee salary and benefit costs, primarily due to our acquisition of Verisity and increased bonus and commission costs; • An increase of $9.9 million in stock-based compensation expense due to grants of restricted stock and the assumption of options in our acquisitions; • An increase of $8.6 million in losses associated with the sale of installment contract receivables; and • An increase of $7.1 million in costs related to the retirement of our Executive Chairman and former President and Chief Executive Officer in 2005; partially offset by • Our restructuring activities, as discussed below. Marketing and Sales 2006 compared to 2005 Marketing and sales expenses increased $39.4 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $14.8 million in stock-based compensation expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; • An increase of $18.2 million in employee salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs due to increased hiring of sales and technical personnel, and higher commissions earned resulting from an increase in 2006 sales performance; and • An increase of $7.8 million in marketing programs and customer-focused conferences due to our new marketing initiatives and increased travel to visit our customers. 2005 compared to 2004 Marketing and sales expenses increased $33.1 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to: • An increase of $29.4 million in employee salary, commission and benefit costs due to increased hiring of sales and technical personnel and higher employee bonuses and commissions; and • An increase of $1.6 million in stock-based compensation expense due to grants of restricted stock and the assumption of options in our acquisitions; partially offset by • A decrease of $1.9 million in marketing program costs. 38 Table of Contents Research and Development 2006 compared to 2005 Research and development expenses increased $69.4 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $31.6 million in stock-based compensation expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; • An increase of $28.3 million in employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs due to increased staffing to support product development and higher employee salaries; • An increase of $3.9 million in third-party development costs; and • An increase of $3.3 million in computer equipment lease costs and maintenance costs associated with third-party software. 2005 compared to 2004 Research and development expense increased $22.6 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to: • An increase of $24.0 million in employee salary and benefit costs, primarily due to our acquisition of Verisity and increased staffing to support product development; and • An increase of $2.2 million in stock-based compensation expense due to grants of restricted stock and the assumption of options in our acquisitions; partially offset by • A decrease of $3.9 million in depreciation expense. General and Administrative 2006 compared to 2005 General and administrative expenses increased $13.7 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $12.0 million in stock-based compensation expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; and • An increase of $9.6 million in losses on the sale of installment contract receivables due to higher discount rates; partially offset by • A decrease of $7.1 million in costs related to the retirement of our Executive Chairman and former President and Chief Executive Officer in 2005; and • A decrease of $3.6 million in bad debt expense. 2005 compared to 2004 General and administrative expense increased $41.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to: • An increase of $9.9 million in employee salary and benefit costs due to higher employee salaries and increased bonuses; • An increase of $8.6 million in losses on the sale of installment contract receivables due to an increase in the number of sales of installment contract receivables; • An increase of $7.1 million in costs related to the retirement of our Executive Chairman and former President and Chief Executive Officer in 2005; • An increase of $6.1 million in stock-based compensation expense due to grants of restricted stock and the assumption of options in our acquisitions; and • An increase of $5.2 million in legal and consulting services; partially offset by • A decrease of $1.2 million in professional fees related to our annual audit and Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. 39 Table of Contents Amortization of Acquired Intangibles 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 23.1 $ 47.8 $ 55.7 Assuming no changes to our current portfolio of intangibles, we expect the Amortization of acquired intangibles to continue decreasing as the amortization periods assigned upon the purchase of certain intangibles are completed. 2006 compared to 2005 Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $24.7 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. Amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior year acquisitions decreased $27.5 million during 2006 due to the full amortization of certain acquired intangibles. This decrease was partially offset by $2.8 million of amortization of intangibles acquired during 2006. 2005 compared to 2004 Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $7.9 million in 2005, as compared to 2004. Amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior year acquisitions decreased $21.0 million during 2005 due to the full amortization of certain acquired intangibles. This decrease was partially offset by $13.1 million of amortization of intangibles acquired during 2005. Restructuring and Other Charges We initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year from 2001 through 2005 in an effort to operate more efficiently while improving operating margins and cash flows. The restructuring plans initiated each year from 2001 through 2005, or the 2001 Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring, 2003 Restructuring, 2004 Restructuring and 2005 Restructuring, respectively, were intended to decrease costs through workforce reductions and facility and resource consolidation, in order to improve our cost structure. The 2001 and 2002 Restructurings primarily related to our design services business and certain other business or infrastructure groups throughout the world. The 2003 Restructuring, 2004 Restructuring and 2005 Restructuring were targeted at reducing costs throughout the company. The 2004 Restructuring has been completed and there was no remaining balance accrued for this restructuring as of December 30, 2006. In addition, we have recorded estimated provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset impairments, and other restructuring costs. Each reporting period, we evaluate the adequacy of the lease loss accrual for each plan of restructuring. We adjust the lease loss accrual for changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect estimated costs or sublease income. We also consider executed sublease agreements and adjust the lease loss accrual if sublease income under the agreement differs from initial estimates. During 2005, in conjunction with the workforce reduction in our European design services business, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction involving land and a building in Livingston, Scotland. Proceeds from the sale were $33.6 million and the total gain on the sale was $3.6 million. We leased back a portion of the facility for the next two years and another portion for ten years, with an option to terminate the ten year lease after five years. We deferred the gain on the sale and are recognizing the gain ratably over the maximum lease term of ten years. 40 Table of Contents A summary of restructuring and other charges by plan of restructuring in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: Severance and Asset- Excess Benefits Related Facilities Other Total (In millions) 2006: 2005 Plan $ (0.1 ) $ ---- $ ---- $ ---- $ (0.1 ) 2003, 2002 and 2001 Plans ---- ---- (0.7 ) ---- (0.7 ) Total 2006 $ (0.1 ) $ ---- $ (0.7 ) $ ---- $ (0.8 ) 2005: 2005 Plan $ 20.8 $ 2.4 $ 2.4 $ ---- $ 25.6 2004 Plan (0.4 ) ---- ---- ---- (0.4 ) 2003, 2002 and 2001 Plans ---- ---- 10.1 ---- 10.1 Total 2005 $ 20.4 $ 2.4 $ 12.5 $ ---- $ 35.3 2004: 2004 Plan $ 7.0 $ 0.2 $ ---- $ 9.4 $ 16.6 2003, 2002 and 2001 Plans (1.3 ) (4.0 ) 2.2 ---- (3.1 ) Total 2004 $ 5.7 $ (3.8 ) $ 2.2 $ 9.4 $ 13.5 Due to the immateriality of the 2003 Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring and 2001 Restructuring, they have been combined in the above table. Frequently, asset impairments are based on significant estimates and assumptions, particularly regarding remaining useful life and utilization rates. We may incur other charges in the future if management determines that the useful life or utilization of certain long-lived assets has been reduced. The initial facility closure and space reduction costs included in these restructurings were comprised of payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs and other contractual charges. To estimate the initial lease loss, which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing all or part of a building, management made certain assumptions related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms, including sublease rates and contractual common area charges. As of December 30, 2006, our accrued estimate of the lease loss related to all restructuring activities initiated since 2001 was $31.3 million. This amount may be adjusted in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. Since 2001, we have recorded facilities consolidation charges, net of credits, of $97.0 million under the 2001 through 2005 Restructurings related to space reductions or facility closures of 49 sites. As of December 30, 2006, 28 of these sites had been vacated and space reductions had occurred at the remaining 21 sites. We expect to pay all of the facilities-related restructuring liabilities for all our restructuring plans prior to 2016. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring activities may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. Our workforce reduction activities related to the 2004 Restructuring and the 2005 Restructuring were completed prior to December 31, 2005. We recorded a credit during the twelve months ended December 30, 41 Table of Contents 2006 to remove the remaining severance and benefits accrual related to the 2005 Restructuring. The other activity recorded in each of the restructuring plans for the year ended December 30, 2006 relates to payment of remaining lease obligations net of sublease payments received and changes in estimate related to lease loss accruals. We expect to incur an additional $1.0 million to $2.0 million of future costs in connection with the 2005 Restructuring and an additional $3.0 million to $5.0 million of future costs in connection with the 2003 Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges, which will be expensed as incurred. The actual amount of additional costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities. Write-off of Acquired In-Process Research and Development Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to expense any acquired in-process research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired in-process research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established. The values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process research and development. The following table summarizes our write-offs of acquired in-process research and development charges in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Verisity Ltd. $ ---- $ 9.4 $ ---- Neolinear, Inc. ---- ---- 7.0 Other 2004 acquisition ---- ---- 2.0 Other 2006 acquisition 0.9 ---- ---- Total in process research and development $ 0.9 $ 9.4 $ 9.0 The following table summarizes, as of December 30, 2006, the status of in-process research and development acquired in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004: Estimated Expenditures Remaining Incurred to Expenditures Complete to Complete In-Process In-Process Discount Commercial Research and Research and Rates Feasibility Development Development (In millions) Verisity Inc. 19% to 32% December 2006 $ 4.3 $ ---- Neolinear, Inc. 28% December 2004 7.2 ---- Other 2004 acquisition 30% December 2004 0.8 ---- Other 2006 acquisition 33% January 2007 0.3 ---- Total Expenditures $ 12.6 $ ---- 42 Table of Contents Loss on Extinguishment of Debt We recorded a Loss on extinguishment of debt of $40.8 million during the year ended December 30, 2006, which includes a premium paid to repurchase a portion of the 2023 Notes of $38.9 million and a write-off of the related portion of unamortized deferred costs of issuing the 2023 Notes of $1.9 million. Interest Expense 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Interest expense $ 12.3 $ 5.4 $ 6.2 2006 compared to 2005 Interest expense increased $6.9 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to the increased interest of $6.4 million related to the Term Loan. 2005 compared to 2004 Interest expense decreased $0.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a decrease of $0.6 million in imputed interest on acquisition-related payments that occur over time. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Interest income $ 39.3 $ 15.6 $ 5.6 Gains on sale of non-marketable securities 19.9 2.5 5.7 Gains on available-for-sale securities 6.7 9.2 6.8 Gains (losses) on trading securities in Cadence’s non-qualified deferred compensation trust 3.7 6.6 (5.0 ) Gains on sale of non-marketable securities in Cadence’s non-qualified deferred compensation trust 2.7 ---- ---- Gains (losses) on foreign exchange 1.9 4.5 (1.4 ) Telos termination costs ---- (2.6 ) ---- Telos management fees (0.9 ) (2.4 ) (2.5 ) Equity loss from investments (1.2 ) (6.5 ) (16.9 ) Write-down of investments (2.5 ) (10.9 ) (4.2 ) Other income (expense) 0.8 (0.9 ) 0.4 Total other income (expense), net $ 70.4 $ 15.1 $ (11.5 ) The increases in interest income in 2006, as compared to 2005, and in 2005, as compared to 2004, were due to increases in our Cash and cash equivalents balances as well as higher interest rates applicable to those balances. In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held by Telos Venture Partners L.P., a limited partnership in which we and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust were the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration of $6.53 per share of common stock. Under the purchase agreement, 10% of the consideration was held in escrow to pay the cost of resolving any claims that could have been asserted against KhiMetrics on or before the first anniversary of the acquisition. The escrow amount remaining after resolution of such claims was distributed to the former stockholders of KhiMetrics in January and February 2007. No gain was recorded on amounts held in escrow during 2006. In connection with this sale, we received approximately $20.2 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately $17.1 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. 43 Table of Contents In addition, our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust received $2.9 million in cash and recorded a gain of $2.5 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (In millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 99.7 $ 79.1 $ 12.0 Effective tax rate 41% 62% 14% 2006 compared to 2005 Our effective tax rate decreased in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to the $30.1 million of non-recurring federal, state and foreign income taxes incurred upon our 2005 repatriation of $500.0 million of certain foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act, which increased the 2005 annual effective tax rate by approximately 23 percentage points. 2005 compared to 2004 Our effective tax rate increased in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to the non-recurring income taxes related to our 2005 repatriation of certain foreign earnings, and an increase in foreign income tax expense from operations in 2005. Outlook for 2007 In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” which prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal year 2007. The cumulative effect of applying FIN No. 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet) for fiscal year 2007. We are currently studying the transition effects of adopting FIN No. 48 and we are not yet able to assess the impact of FIN No. 48 on our 2007 financial statements and, therefore, we are not currently able to disclose the expected effect of its adoption nor our outlook for the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate. As of December 30, 2006, we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately $150.1 million. Realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however, could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts, including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from those estimated. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million. The most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary. We have filed a protest to certain of the proposed adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS where the matter is currently being considered. In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency 44 Table of Contents for the three-year period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period. The proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately $152.0 million. The remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we have with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income. The IRS took similar positions with respect to our transfer pricing arrangements in the prior examination period and may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements in future examinations. We have filed a timely protest with the IRS and will seek resolution of the issues through the Appeals Office of the IRS. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously. The RARs are not final Statutory Notices of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four and ten percent since 1997. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations including the RARs for the tax years 1997 through 2002. We provide for tax liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets unless we consider it probable that additional taxes will not be due. However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, we cannot assure you that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination, we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods. Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and costs associated with foreign currency hedges. We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. 45 Table of Contents All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 30, 2006. The following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified as Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2006. Carrying Average Value Interest Rate (In millions) Interest-Bearing Instruments: Commercial Paper – fixed rate $ 848.3 5.43% Cash – variable rate 46.1 2.85% Cash equivalents – variable rate 6.0 5.19% Cash equivalents – fixed rate 11.6 1.64% Total interest-bearing instruments $ 912.0 5.25% Foreign Currency Risk Our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening United States dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other assets. Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures. 46 Table of Contents The following table provides information, as of December 30, 2006, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured prior to January 12, 2007. Weighted Average Notional Contract Principal Rate (In millions) Forward Contracts: Japanese yen $ 116.9 117.08 British pound sterling 41.9 0.51 European Union euro 15.3 0.75 Indian rupee 10.8 44.95 Other 19.9 Total $ 204.8 Estimated fair value $ 2.0 While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Equity Price Risk 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes and collectively, the Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions, sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For an additional description of the Convertible Senior Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see the discussion under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with one of the initial purchasers and in a separate transaction, sold warrants to one of the initial purchasers to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2023 Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For an additional description of the 2023 Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see the discussion under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. Investments We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. 47 Table of Contents Under our strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. The fair value of our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable equity securities, which are included in Short-term investments on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $23.7 million as of December 30, 2006 and $33.0 million as of December 31, 2005. While we actively monitor these investments, we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we own, would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be able to liquidate a particular investment when desired. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $31.4 million as of December 30, 2006 and $37.9 million as of December 31, 2005. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists for a non-marketable equity security, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write-down as an investment loss in our Consolidated Income Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of and for the years ended December 30, % December 31, % January 1, 2006 Change 2005 Change 2005 (In millions, except percentages) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 958.4 7% $ 894.6 51% $ 593.0 Net working capital $ 763.9 14% $ 670.5 29% $ 521.0 Cash provided by operating activities $ 421.2 (1)% $ 426.3 14% $ 372.5 Cash used for investing activities $ (111.8 ) (50)% $ (222.7) 4% $ (215.0) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ (233.9 ) (214)% $ 205.3 (1,073)% $ (21.1) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments As of December 30, 2006, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $958.4 million of Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $894.6 million as of December 31, 2005 and $593.0 million as of January 1, 2005. The primary sources of our cash in 2006 and 2005 were: • Customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or lease of our hardware products; • Customer payments for design and methodology services; • Borrowings under the Term Loan; • Proceeds from the sale of receivables and proceeds from the exercise of stock options; • Proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in 2006; • Proceeds from the separate warrant sale transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in 2006; • Proceeds from the termination of a portion of the hedge transactions originally entered into in connection with the issuance of our 2023 Notes; and • Common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans. 48 Table of Contents Our primary uses of cash in 2006 and 2005 consisted of: • Payments relating to payroll, product, services and other operating expenses; • Payments of taxes; • Purchases of property, plant and equipment; • Payments of long-term debt and repurchases of a portion of the 2023 Notes; • Payments made to purchase the hedges in connection with our issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes; • Payments made to terminate a portion of the warrant transactions originally entered in connection with the issuance of our 2023 notes; • Purchases of treasury stock; and • Payments related to business acquisitions. Net working capital Net working capital increased $93.4 million as of December 30, 2006, as compared to December 31, 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $73.0 million in Cash and cash equivalents; • A decrease of $40.8 million in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities; • A decrease of $13.0 million in Current portion of deferred revenue; partially offset by • A decrease of $43.6 million in Accounts receivable, net; and • A decrease of $9.2 million in Short-term investments. Net working capital increased $149.5 million as of December 31, 2005, as compared to January 1, 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $301.6 million in Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments; partially offset by • A decrease of $102.0 million in Accounts receivable, net; • An increase of $22.6 million in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and • An increase of $32.0 million in Current portion of long-term debt. Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities are provided by net income, adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the balance of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our receivables. We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During 2006, we transferred accounts receivable, net of the losses on the sale of the receivables, totaling $180.6 million, which approximated fair value, to financing institutions on a non-recourse basis, as compared to $192.1 million in 2005 and $30.1 million in 2004. 2006 compared to 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5.1 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily due to: • An increase of $71.8 million in payments of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities; 49 Table of Contents • A decrease of $68.3 million in cash received from the collection of Receivables and Installment contract receivables; and • A decrease of $37.6 million in Depreciation and amortization; partially offset by • An increase of $93.2 million in net income; • An increase of $40.8 million in Loss on extinguishment of debt; and • An increase of $64.1 million in Stock-based compensation. 2005 compared to 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $53.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004. The increase was primarily due to: • An increase of $162.0 million in Proceeds from the sale of receivables; and • A decrease of $18.3 million in payments of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities; partially offset by • A decrease of $25.1 million in net income; • A decrease of $71.9 million in cash received from collection of Receivables and Installment contract receivables; and • An increase of $14.8 million in Other assets. Cash flows from investing activities Our primary investing activities consisted of: • Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment; • Purchases and proceeds from short-term investments; • Acquiring businesses, assets and intangibles; and • Investing in venture capital partnerships and equity investments. In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held by Telos Venture Partners L.P., a limited partnership in which we and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust were the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration of $6.53 per share of common stock. Under the purchase agreement, 10% of the consideration was held in escrow to pay the cost of resolving any claims that could have been asserted against KhiMetrics on or before the first anniversary of the acquisition. The escrow amount remaining after resolution of such claims was distributed to the former stockholders of KhiMetrics in January and February 2007. No gain was recorded on amounts held in escrow during 2006. In connection with this sale, we received approximately $20.2 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately $17.1 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. In addition, our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust received $2.9 million in cash and recorded a gain of $2.5 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. 2006 compared to 2005 Net cash used for investing activities decreased by $110.9 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily due to: • A decrease of $180.8 million in Purchases of short-term investments; and • A decrease of $231.4 million in Cash paid in business combinations, net of cash acquired and acquisition of intangibles; partially offset by • A decrease of $289.2 million in Proceeds from the sale of short-term investments; and • A decrease of $33.3 million in Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. 2005 compared to 2004 Net cash used for investing activities increased by $7.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004. The increase was primarily due to: • An increase of $182.0 million in Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired; partially offset by 50 Table of Contents • An increase of $141.2 million in Proceeds from the sale of short-term investments, net of Purchases of short-term investments; and • An increase of $30.0 million in Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Cash flows from financing activities Financing cash flows consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in 2006, including payments for the hedge transactions and the proceeds from the separate warrant transactions, payments on the Term Loan in 2006, proceeds received from the Term Loan in 2005, the repurchase of treasury stock and the issuance of stock under certain employee plans in both 2006 and 2005. 2006 compared to 2005 Net cash used for financing activities was $233.9 million in 2006, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $205.3 million in 2005, a decrease of $439.2 million. The decrease was primarily due to: • An increase of $393.0 million in Purchases of treasury stock; • The repurchase of $228.5 million of the 2023 Notes; • A decrease of $160.0 million in Proceeds from Term Loan; • An increase of $131.9 million in Principal payments on long-term debt, primarily the Term Loan; and • An increase of $119.8 million in Purchase of call options, or hedges, in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes; partially offset by • An increase of $500.0 million in Proceeds from issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes; • An increase of $55.9 million in Proceeds from sale of call options, or hedges, in connection with the 2023 Notes; and • An increase of $39.4 million in Proceeds from sale of common stock warrants in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes. 2005 compared to 2004 Net cash provided by financing activities was $205.3 million in 2005, as compared to net cash used for financing activities of $21.1 million in 2004, an increase of $226.4 million. The increase of cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to: • An increase of $160.0 million in Proceeds from the Term Loan; and • An increase of $71.2 million in Proceeds from issuances of common stock; partially offset by • An increase of $7.0 million in Purchases of treasury stock. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources Income Taxes We provide for United States income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered permanently invested outside of the United States. As of December 30, 2006, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $274.0 million. As of December 30, 2006, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $84.0 million. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million. In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period to be approximately $318.0 million. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously. The RARs are not final Statutory Notices of Deficiency but the IRS imposes 51 Table of Contents interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four and ten percent since 1997. For an additional description of the IRS examinations for the years 1997 through 1999 and 2000 through 2002, see the discussion under the heading “Provision for Income Taxes” above. Term Loan In December 2005, our Irish subsidiary, Castlewilder, entered into a syndicated term facility agreement, or Credit Agreement, with Banc of America Securities LLC as lead arranger, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a three-year $160.0 million unsecured term loan, or Term Loan. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, Castlewilder, at its election, may prepay the loan, in whole or in part, with no prepayment fee. During the year ended December 30, 2006, Castlewilder made quarterly principal payments of $32.0 million, plus additional prepayments of $100.0 million of the principal amount due under the loan, thereby reducing principal payments due under the Term Loan in 2007 and 2008. As of December 30, 2006, scheduled principal payments on the Term Loan due during 2007 are $28.0 million. 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively, the Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of approximately $487.0 million after transaction fees of approximately $13.0 million, including $12.0 million of underwriting discounts, that were recorded in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2006 and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes. A portion of the net proceeds totaling $228.5 million was used to purchase $189.6 million principal amount of our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, or the 2023 Notes. Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events: • The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes; • Specified corporate transactions occur; or • The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below a certain threshold. On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of 2013 Notes, until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. We may not redeem the Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity. The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is 47.2813 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $21.15 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each day, during a specified observation period following the conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of the observation period consists of: • Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and • Our common stock to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity, we will, in certain cases, increase the conversion rate by an amount up to $8.27 per share, for a holder that elects to convert its Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such fundamental change, which amount will be paid entirely in cash. A fundamental change is any transaction or event (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) in connection with which more than 50% of our common stock is 52 Table of Contents exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive, consideration which is not at least 90% shares of common stock, or depositary receipts representing such shares, that are: • Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or • Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national securities exchange. As of December 30, 2006, none of the conditions allowing the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met. Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each December 15th and June 15th. Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with various parties whereby we have the option to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $21.15 per share, subject to adjustment. These options expire on December 15, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and December 15, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net shares. The aggregate cost of these hedge transactions was $119.8 million and has been recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF No. 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock.” The estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was $118.3 million as of December 30, 2006. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity. In separate transactions, we also sold warrants to various parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2012 through April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes, and February 2014 through April 2014 in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net shares. We received $39.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants, which has been recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF No. 00-19. The estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was $42.6 million as of December 30, 2006. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these warrants will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity. The warrants will be included in diluted earnings per share, or EPS, to the extent the impact is not considered anti-dilutive. Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of $406.4 million after transaction fees of $13.6 million that were recorded in Other long-term assets and are being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over five years, which is the duration of the first redemption period. The 2023 Notes were issued by us at par and bear no interest. The 2023 Notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in December 2006, we repurchased $189.6 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes, reducing the aggregate number of shares to be issued upon conversion to 14.7 million. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The holders of the 2023 Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2023 Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount, by providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice. The repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase date. In addition, we may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or after August 15, 2008 53 Table of Contents for 100.00% of the principal amount, except for those 2023 Notes that holders have required us to repurchase on August 15, 2008 or on other repurchase dates, as described above. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2023 Notes will initially be convertible into 63.8790 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes prior to maturity only if: • The price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during certain periods of time specified in the 2023 Notes; • Specified corporate transactions occur; • The 2023 Notes have been called for redemption; or • The trading price of the 2023 Notes falls below a certain threshold. In the event of a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their 2023 Notes for 100.00% of the principal amount. Upon a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure, in certain circumstances we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of December 30, 2006, none of the conditions allowing the holders of the 2023 Notes to convert had been met. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in December 2006, a portion of the proceeds were used to purchase in the open market 2023 Notes with a principal balance of $189.6 million for a total purchase price of $228.5 million. In connection with this purchase, we incurred expenses of $40.8 million for the early extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt included the call premium on the purchased 2023 Notes and the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with a financial institution whereby we originally acquired options to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the hedge transactions to us was $134.6 million. In connection with the purchase of a portion of the 2023 Notes in December 2006, we also sold 12.1 million of the hedges that were originally purchased in connection with the 2023 Notes and received proceeds of $55.9 million. In addition, we sold warrants for our common stock to a financial institution for the purchase of up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net shares. We received $56.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. In connection with the purchase of a portion of the 2023 Notes in December 2006, we also purchased 12.1 million of the warrants for our common stock that were originally issued in connection with the 2023 Notes at a cost of $10.2 million. The remaining outstanding warrants will be included in diluted EPS to the extent the impact is not considered anti-dilutive. As of December 30, 2006, the estimated fair value of the remaining hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes was $68.3 million and the estimated fair value of the remaining warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes was $12.0 million. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these hedge and warrant transactions will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity. Sale-leaseback Agreement In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in San Jose, California for a sale price of $46.5 million. Concurrently with the sale, we leased back from the purchaser approximately 262,500 square feet of office space, which represents all available space in the buildings. The lease agreement includes an initial term of two years, with two options to extend the lease for six months each. We have committed to lease payments related to this lease of $2.2 million in 2007, $2.4 million in 2008 and $0.2 million in 2009. We received cash payment for the full sale price in January 2007. During the lease term, we intend to construct an additional building located on our San Jose, California campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction. We expect to use approximately $22.0 million in cash during 2007 to begin construction on this new building. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 30, 2006 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less More Total Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Than 5 Years (In millions) Operating lease obligations $ 135.4 $ 33.9 $ 44.9 $ 19.9 $ 36.7 Purchase obligations 20.7 19.6 1.1 ---- ---- Term loan 28.0 28.0 ---- ---- ---- Convertible notes 730.4 ---- 230.4 250.0 250.0 Contractual interest payments 44.2 7.9 14.4 14.4 7.5 Other long-term contractual obligations 278.9 ---- 268.7 10.2 ---- Total $ 1,237.6 $ 89.4 $ 559.5 $ 294.5 $ 294.2 As of December 30, 2006, the primary component of Other long-term contractual obligations of $278.9 million related to income tax and acquisition related liabilities. We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. As of December 30, 2006, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. New Accounting Standards In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” which prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 amends SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” to eliminate its applicability to income taxes. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying FIN No. 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet) for fiscal 2007. We are currently studying the transition effects of adopting FIN No. 48 and we are not yet able to assess the impact of FIN No. 48 on our financial statements and, therefore, we are currently not able to disclose the expected effect of adoption. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,” which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB No. 108 is effective for us for the year ended December 30, 2006. The implementation of SAB No. 108 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157, but do 55 Table of Contents not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We license software, sell or lease hardware technology, provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide engineering and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate product development processes for electronics. Our broad range of products and services are used by the world’s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and electronics systems. We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services. In the past, our revenue recognition has been significantly affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period. Our revenue may also be deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from certain customers and for certain contracts. For additional description of our revenue recognition, see the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates — Revenue Recognition,” below. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from IC manufacturers and designers and electronics systems companies and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects. As a result, our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers’ business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products. The IC, electronics systems and semiconductor industries are currently experiencing significant challenges, primarily due to a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, which is characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. As a result of this downturn, some of our customers faced financial challenges in fiscal 2008 and may continue to face such challenges in fiscal 2009. It is unclear when the macroeconomic environment may improve. We are seeing increasing pressures on our customers’ research and development budgets, and therefore our customers are looking for more flexibility in the type of software and hardware products they purchase and how and when they purchase them. The current economic downturn in our customers’ industries has contributed to the substantial reduction in our revenue and could continue to harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses, some of our customers are waiting to purchase our products and are increasingly seeking purchasing terms and conditions that are less favorable to us. As a result of this trend, we experienced lower business levels for fiscal 2008 and we have forecasted lower business levels for fiscal 2009. We recognized a net loss for fiscal 2008 and we expect to recognize a net loss for fiscal 2009. To enable us to keep our focus on the value of our technology and to assist with customer demands, we are transitioning to a license mix that will provide our customers with greater flexibility and will result in a higher portion of our revenue being recognized ratably. Our customers may also experience adverse changes in their business and, as a result, may delay or default on their payment obligations, file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products. If our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to 34 Table of Contents pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate existing contractual commitments. Though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Due to the decline in our stock price and market capitalization, our fiscal 2008 net loss, expected future net losses, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry, we recorded impairment charges totaling $1,317.2 million in fiscal 2008, representing all of our acquired goodwill, and we recorded an additional valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of $332.9 million. We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels. To offset some of the impact of our expected decrease in revenue, we have implemented cost savings initiatives, including reducing headcount, decreasing employee bonuses and reducing other discretionary spending. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue. This restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by at least 625 positions. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $150.0 million related to this restructuring plan. Product performance and size specifications of the mobile and other consumer electronics market are requiring electronic systems to be smaller, consume less power and provide multiple functions in one system-on-chip, or SoC, or system-in-package, or SiP. The design challenge is also becoming more complex with each new generation of electronics because providers of EDA solutions are required to deliver products that address these technical challenges and improve the efficiency and productivity of the design process in a price-conscious environment. With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation steps. We combine our design technologies into “platforms” addressing four major design activities: functional verification, digital IC design, custom IC design and system interconnect design. The four Cadence design platforms are Incisive functional verification, Encounter digital IC design, Virtuoso custom design and Allegro system interconnect design platforms. In addition, we augment these platform product offerings with a set of DFM products that service both the digital and custom IC design flows. These four platforms, together with our DFM products, comprised our primary product lines during fiscal 2008. In connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we made certain changes to our DFM product strategy, including focusing on integrating DFM awareness into our core design platforms of Encounter and Virtuoso. The changes in our DFM strategy resulted in an impairment charge of $42.5 million arising from the abandonment and reduction to net realizable value of certain identifiable intangible assets. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items more fully below under the heading “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Management On October 15, 2008, we announced the resignation of Michael J. Fister, our President and Chief Executive Officer and member of our Board of Directors, and four other executive officers, and in connection with Mr. Fister’s resignation, our Board of Directors formed an Interim Office of the Chief Executive, or the IOCE, to oversee the day-to-day running of our operations. On January 8, 2009, we announced the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as our new President and Chief Executive Officer and the dissolution of the IOCE. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical 35 Table of Contents experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes and valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9, “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,” to all software licensing transactions and to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental. We also apply the provisions of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists. We license software using three different license types: • Subscription licenses; • Term licenses; and • Perpetual licenses. For many of our term and subscription license arrangements, we use our proprietary internet-based delivery mechanism, “eDA-on-tap,” to facilitate the delivery of our software products. To maximize the efficiency of this delivery mechanism, we created what we refer to as “eDA Cards,” of which there are two types. Subscription license customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eDA Platinum Card,” which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and the ability to use additional unspecified software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement. Term license customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eDA Gold Card,” which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement. Overall, the eDA Cards provide greater flexibility for our customers in how and when they deploy and use our software products. Subscription licenses – Our subscription license arrangements offer our customers the right to: • Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement, generally two to four years, with no rights to return; • Use unspecified additional software products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement; and • Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other unspecified additional software products that may become available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software because all software products have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to use them. Customers that purchase an eDA Platinum Card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement, and to use other unspecified additional software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement, until the fees have been depleted. 36 Table of Contents In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product. Subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance that was established in connection with the sale of our term licenses. In the event that a subscription license arrangement is terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or after the termination of the subscription license arrangement, the revenue associated with the new term license arrangement is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, assuming all other criteria in SOP 97-2 have been met. Term licenses – Our term license arrangements offer our customers the right to: • Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement, generally two to four years, with no rights to return; and • Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software because all software products have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to use them. Customers that purchase an eDA Gold Card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement until the fees relating to the arrangement have been depleted. In general, revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product. Perpetual licenses – Our perpetual licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software. In general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement – Generally, we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does not exist, we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service projects, such as training classes and small methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other service engagements, we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement. Sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Product delivery – Software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of free-on-board, or F.O.B., shipping point. Our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point. For customers who purchase eDA Gold or eDA Platinum Cards, delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant to the terms of the software license agreement. Fee is fixed or determinable – We assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. We have established a history of collecting 37 Table of Contents under the original contract without providing concessions on payments, products or services. For our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment, we only consider that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. We have a history of collecting receivables under installment contracts of up to five years. Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable. We must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Collection is probable – We assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the customer’s payment history and its current creditworthiness. We have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement, particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Multiple element arrangement – A multiple element arrangement, or MEA, is any arrangement that includes or contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware products, software license types, services, training or maintenance in a single arrangement. From time to time, we may include individual deliverables in separately priced and separately signed contracts with the same customer. We obtain and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, a MEA. Significant judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of contracts might be so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement. Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value – Our VSOE for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered. Our experience has been that we are able to determine VSOE for maintenance and time-based services, but not for product. Finance fee revenue – Finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees are recognized using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented approximately 3% of total revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2% for each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Upon the sale of an installment contract, we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract. Services revenue – Services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing engineering services. These services are not related to the functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of- 38 Table of Contents completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48. Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this assessment, we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. As required under SFAS No. 109, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified. For example, a company’s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook. For the year ended January 3, 2009, we concluded that a significant increase in valuation allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence. If, in the future, we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part, of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made. For additional description of the fiscal 2008 valuation allowance, see the discussion under the heading “Results of Operations — Provision for Income Taxes,” below. Under FIN No. 48, we may only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret the application of complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and practices. If an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. To determine if a tax position is effectively settled, we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination had otherwise been completed. We must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal year-end. These judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements that are based on the requirements of FIN No. 48. We must re-evaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes 39 Table of Contents in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We are also required to assess whether the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Given the escalating challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008, we decided to repatriate $250.0 million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the United States that had previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which deferred taxes had not been previously provided. We currently expect that an additional $67.2 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries will not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a result, we have accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the potential federal, state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations. To calculate this tax expense, we were required to estimate the geographic mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income and dividend withholding tax rates, the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the potential outcomes of current and future tax audits. Changes in our actual or projected operating results, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, foreign exchange rates and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets Goodwill Costs in excess of the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination are recorded as goodwill. SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” requires that companies not amortize goodwill, but instead test for impairment at least annually. We have evaluated goodwill on an annual basis since our adoption of SFAS No. 142 and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss. The preparation of the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the determination of fair values of reporting units and tangible and intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions, which include future values, are complex and often subjective and may differ significantly from period to period based on changes in the overall economic environment, changes in our industry and changes in our strategy or our internal forecasts. Estimates and assumptions with respect to the determination of the fair value of our reporting unit include: • Control premium assigned to our market capitalization; • Our operating forecasts; • Revenue growth rates; • Risk-commensurate discount rates and costs of capital; and • Market multiples of revenue and earnings. These estimates and assumptions, along with others, are used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit as well as tangible and intangible assets. While we believe the estimates and assumptions we used are reasonable, different assumptions may materially impact the resulting fair value of the reporting unit, tangible assets and intangible assets, the amount of impairment we record in any given period and our results of operations. We engage independent valuation experts to assess the reasonableness of our assumptions and to perform certain portions of our goodwill impairment analysis. 40 Table of Contents Other Long-lived Assets We review long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset’s carrying amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” In addition, we assess our long-lived assets for impairment if they are abandoned. For long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired intangibles, we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset, excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment is required in: • Identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances; • Forecasting future operating results; and • Estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long-lived or intangible assets. In future periods, material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made. Results of Operations As noted above, we saw increasing pressures on the research and development budgets in our customer base due to the deceleration of growth in the electronics systems and semiconductor industries and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. In addition, the escalating challenges in the global capital markets made it important to keep cash available and held in short-term, low-risk investments. Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected the following: • Lower business levels due to the challenges in the current macroeconomic environment and the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers; • Lower business levels and up-front revenue recognized due to our transition to a ratable license mix, which began in the third quarter of fiscal 2008; • Initiation of a restructuring plan, resulting in $46.4 million of expense during fiscal 2008; • Impairment of all of our $1,317.2 million of goodwill and $47.1 million of intangible and tangible assets; • Repatriation of earnings that had previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which deferred taxes had not been previously provided, resulting in additional provisions for income taxes of $101.1 million; • Additional valuation allowance of $332.9 million against our deferred tax assets; and • Resignations of five executive officers resulting in severance expense of $16.4 million, $7.1 million of which was stock-based compensation. Revenue We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services. We principally utilize three license types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types provide a customer with different conditions of use for our products, such as: • The right to access new technology; • The duration of the license; and • Payment timing. Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use, this will result in either a subscription or term license. A business implication of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore 41 Table of Contents renew the license agreement. Because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups, rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license. See the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates — Revenue Recognition” above for additional description of license types and timing of revenue recognition. Although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period, we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: • Competitiveness of our new technology; • Timing of contract renewals with existing customers; • Length of our sales cycle; and • Size, duration, terms and type of: • Contract renewals with existing customers; • Additional sales to existing customers; and • Sales to new customers. A substantial portion of our total revenue is recognized over multiple periods. In the past, a significant portion of our product revenue has been recognized upon delivery of licensed software, which generally occurs upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product. We are moving to a license mix that will result in increased ratable revenue and we expect the percentage of product revenue from backlog to increase in future years. The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription, term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms. The timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements with existing customers (e.g., customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements to term license arrangements). Revenue Mix We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. During fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, our product groups were as follows: Functional Verification: Products in this group, which include the Incisive functional verification platform, are used to verify that the high level, logical representation of an IC design is functionally correct. Digital IC Design: Products in this group, which include the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to accurately convert the high-level, logical representation of a digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the IC will be physically implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture. Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, which include the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for ICs that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, radio frequency, memories, high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries. Detailed design information showing how an IC will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture. System Interconnect Design: This product group consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro and OrCAD products. The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co-design of interconnects across ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions. Design for Manufacturing: Included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the IC has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. In connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we made certain changes to our DFM product 42 Table of Contents strategy, including focusing on integrating DFM awareness into our core design platforms of Encounter and Virtuoso. The changes in our DFM strategy resulted in an impairment charge of $42.5 million arising from the abandonment and reduction to net realizable value of certain identifiable intangible assets. For additional description of our current product strategy, see the discussion under the heading “Products and Product Strategy” under Item 1, “Business,” above. Revenue by Year The following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and the dollar change in revenue between years: Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Product $ 516.6 $ 1,104.0 $ 982.7 $ (587.4) $ 121.3 Services 133.5 125.8 134.9 7.7 (9.1 ) Maintenance 388.5 385.2 366.3 3.3 18.9 Total revenue $ 1,038.6 $ 1,615.0 $ 1,483.9 $ (576.4) $ 131.1 Product revenue decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers, our transition to a ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle. As a result, product revenue decreased for all product groups, and particularly for Digital IC Design, Custom IC Design and Functional Verification products during fiscal 2008. Due to the lower business levels and the change in the license mix in the second half of fiscal 2008, we expect to recognize decreased revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. Product revenue was higher during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital IC Design, Functional Verification and Custom IC Design products, partially offset by a small decrease in revenue from licenses for DFM products. Revenue by Product Group The following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and Services and other during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006: 2008 2007 2006 Functional Verification 22% 24% 24% Digital IC Design 24% 27% 24% Custom IC Design 24% 27% 27% System Interconnect Design 11% 8% 9% Design for Manufacturing 6% 6% 7% Services and other 13% 8% 9% Total 100% 100% 100% As described under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates” above, certain of our licenses allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have licensed a combination of our products to customers with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the above table would differ. 43 Table of Contents Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement. Revenue by Geography Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) United States $ 435.1 $ 741.9 $ 765.1 $ (306.8 ) $ (23.2) Other Americas 33.0 34.8 31.3 (1.8 ) 3.5 Europe, Middle East and Africa 230.8 296.9 284.4 (66.1 ) 12.5 Japan 204.1 342.6 247.9 (138.5 ) 94.7 Asia 135.6 198.8 155.2 (63.2 ) 43.6 Total revenue $ 1,038.6 $ 1,615.0 $ 1,483.9 $ (576.4 ) $ 131.1 Revenue by Geography as a Percentage of Total Revenue 2008 2007 2006 United States 42% 46% 52% Other Americas 3% 2% 2% Europe, Middle East and Africa 22% 19% 19% Japan 20% 21% 17% Asia 13% 12% 10% The rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those regions. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by $24.5 million during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen and the European Union euro, partially offset by an increase in the valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the British pound. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by $2.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the European Union euro and the British pound, partially offset by an increase in the valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen. Additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation Expense Summary Stock-based compensation expense is reflected throughout our costs and expenses during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Cost of product $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 Cost of services 4.3 3.9 4.0 Cost of maintenance 2.8 2.5 2.5 Marketing and sales 17.4 22.2 23.9 Research and development 36.7 46.3 50.9 General and administrative 19.9 26.3 22.5 Total $ 81.3 $ 101.4 $ 104.0 Stock-based compensation expense decreased $20.1 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and $2.6 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Restricted stock and stock bonuses $ (16.2 ) $ 6.0 Stock options (7.2 ) (10.5 ) Employee stock purchase plan 3.3 1.9 $ (20.1 ) $ (2.6 ) Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, collectively referred to as restricted stock, and stock bonuses decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the reversal of $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the modification of certain performance-based restricted stock awards, new grants of restricted stock being valued at a lower stock price and a decrease in stock bonuses. Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock bonuses increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, as we issued more restricted stock in place of stock options and due to our increased stock price during fiscal 2007. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options decreased in each of fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to our increased use of restricted stock instead of stock options, partially offset by an increase in stock option expense during fiscal 2008 due to the acceleration of vesting for the five executive officers that resigned during fiscal 2008. We expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to decrease during fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower fair values at grant dates for both restricted stock and stock options, and due to the cancellation of restricted stock and stock options due to our restructuring plan and other attrition. Expected Effects of Restructuring Plans We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels. To offset some of the impact of our expected decrease in revenue, we have implemented cost savings initiatives, including reducing headcount, decreasing employee bonuses and reducing other discretionary spending. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue. This restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by at least 625 positions. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $150.0 million related to this restructuring plan. 45 Table of Contents Cost of Revenue Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Product $ 50.3 $ 60.1 $ 66.8 $ (9.8 ) $ (6.7 ) Services 103.3 93.4 96.5 9.9 (3.1 ) Maintenance 55.8 61.1 63.8 (5.3 ) (2.7 ) The following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006: 2008 2007 2006 Product 10 % 5 % 7 % Services 77 % 74 % 72 % Maintenance 14 % 16 % 17 % Cost of Product Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products, the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials, assembly and overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software product. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to decreased software product revenue during fiscal 2008. A summary of Cost of product during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Product related costs $ 33.0 $ 37.8 $ 33.6 Amortization of acquired intangibles 17.3 22.3 33.2 Total Cost of product $ 50.3 $ 60.1 $ 66.8 Cost of product decreased $9.8 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and $6.7 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Hardware costs $ (5.8 ) $ 5.0 Amortization of acquired intangibles (5.1 ) (10.9 ) Other individually insignificant items 1.1 (0.8 ) $ (9.8 ) $ (6.7 ) Hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales, partially offset by a write-off of obsolete inventory during fiscal 2008. Hardware costs increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in hardware sales. 46 Table of Contents Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased in each of fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized during the related periods. We expect the amortization of acquired intangibles component of Cost of product to decrease during fiscal 2009 due to the impairment of certain acquired intangibles during fiscal 2008. Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period. Cost of Services Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services increased $9.9 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and decreased $3.1 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ 3.3 $ 2.4 Computer equipment lease costs and maintenance costs associated with third-party software 2.2 (1.4 ) Facilities and other infrastructure costs 1.9 ---- Portion of the gain on the sale of land and building that relates to Cost of services expense 1.1 (1.3 ) Professional services costs 0.3 (1.2 ) Other individually insignificant items 1.1 (1.6 ) $ 9.9 $ (3.1 ) Cost of Maintenance Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, and documentation of maintenance updates. Cost of maintenance decreased $5.3 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and decreased $2.7 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Salary, benefit and other employee-related costs $ (4.6 ) $ (0.9 ) Other individually insignificant items (0.7 ) (1.8 ) $ (5.3 ) $ (2.7 ) Operating Expenses Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Marketing and sales $ 358.4 $ 407.1 $ 405.6 $ (48.7 ) $ 1.5 Research and development 457.9 494.0 460.1 (36.1 ) 33.9 47 Table of Contents Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) General and administrative 152.0 169.0 143.3 (17.0 ) 25.7 Total operating expenses $ 968.3 $ 1,070.1 $ 1,009.0 $ (101.8 ) $ 61.1 The following table shows operating expenses as percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006: 2008 2007 2006 Marketing and sales 35% 25% 27% Research and development 44% 31% 31% General and administrative 15% 10% 10% Our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to our lower Product revenue during the period. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expense decreased $48.7 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and increased $1.5 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs $ (44.7 ) $ 8.8 Travel and customer conference costs (5.9 ) ---- Stock-based compensation (4.8 ) (1.8 ) Professional services costs 1.0 (2.3 ) Executive severance costs 1.5 ---- Portion of the gain on the sale of land and building that relates to Marketing and sales expense 3.0 (3.8 ) Facilities and other infrastructure costs 3.2 ---- Other individually insignificant items (2.0 ) 0.6 $ (48.7 ) $ 1.5 Salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a reduction in headcount and a decrease in employee bonuses. These costs increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increased headcount and higher bonuses earned during fiscal 2007. Travel and customer conference costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, as we reduced certain discretionary spending. During fiscal 2007, we recognized a gain on the sale of land and buildings that related to and accordingly reduced Marketing and sales expense for that period. There was no similar reduction during fiscal 2008. 48 Table of Contents Research and Development Research and development expense decreased $36.1 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and increased $33.9 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ (26.8 ) $ 38.1 Stock-based compensation (9.6 ) (4.6 ) Professional services costs (7.3 ) 4.1 Travel costs (3.5 ) ---- Executive severance costs 1.1 ---- Computer equipment lease costs and maintenance costs associated with third-party software 3.0 2.9 Facilities and other infrastructure costs 3.1 ---- Portion of the gain on the sale of land and building that relates to Research and development expense 5.1 (6.5 ) Other individually insignificant items (1.2 ) (0.1 ) $ (36.1 ) $ 33.9 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a reduction in headcount and a decrease in employee bonuses. These costs increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increased headcount and higher bonuses earned during fiscal 2007. Professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to our overall spending reductions and cost savings initiatives implemented during the year. During fiscal 2007, we recognized a gain on the sale of land and buildings that related to and accordingly reduced Research and development expense for that period. There was no similar reduction during fiscal 2008. General and Administrative General and administrative expense decreased $17.0 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and increased $25.7 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ (12.1 ) $ 8.2 Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables (7.7 ) (6.5 ) Stock-based compensation (6.4 ) 3.9 Litigation, legal and other professional services costs (3.0 ) 18.4 Computer equipment lease costs and maintenance costs associated with third-party software (2.0 ) ---- Bad debt expense 6.2 3.8 Executive severance costs 6.7 ---- Other individually insignificant items 1.3 (2.1 ) $ (17.0 ) $ 25.7 Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a reduction in headcount and a decrease in employee bonuses. These costs increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increased headcount and higher bonuses earned during fiscal 2007. 49 Table of Contents Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a reduction in sales of receivables. As a result of the credit losses recorded by banks during 2008 and the current financial challenges experienced by banks, a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about over-exposure to the technology sector. In addition, the change in our license mix will result in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions. Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the lower discount rates available to us during fiscal 2007. Litigation, legal and other professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to litigation costs incurred in fiscal 2007 that did not recur in fiscal 2008, offset by increased professional services fees related to our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics Corporation and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008. See additional discussion of our current litigation under the heading Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” above. Litigation, legal and other professional services costs increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in litigation costs incurred in fiscal 2007. Bad debt expense increased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other regions of the world. As a result, our customers may experience adverse changes in their business, which may result in a delay or default on their payment obligations. Bad debt expense increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting a lower amount of bad debt recoveries during fiscal 2007. Executive severance costs in fiscal 2008 relate to the cash payable to three of the five executives who resigned in October 2008. The expense related to the other two resignations of our executive officers is included in our Sales and marketing and Research and development expenses. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 22.7 $ 19.4 $ 23.1 $ 3.3 $ (3.7 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles increased $3.3 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and decreased $3.7 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Increased amortization due to additions of acquired intangibles $ 6.0 $ 5.0 Decrease due to completed amortization of acquired intangibles (2.7 ) (8.7 ) $ 3.3 $ (3.7 ) During fiscal 2008, we impaired acquired intangibles of $42.5 million, which will decrease our Amortization of acquired intangibles beginning during fiscal 2009. For additional description of this impairment, see the discussion under the heading “Impairment of Intangible and Tangible Assets,” below. Restructuring and Other Charges During fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan, or the 2008 Restructuring Plan, to decrease costs by reducing our workforce across the company and by consolidating facilities. We recorded total costs associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plan of $46.7 million during fiscal 2008 for severance and benefits, excess facilities and other charges. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our severance and related benefits accrual, and adjust the balance based on actual costs incurred or changes in estimates and assumptions. We may incur future charges to 50 Table of Contents reflect actual costs incurred or for changes in estimates related to amounts previously recorded and for additional activities under the 2008 Restructuring Plan. We also initiated restructuring plans in each year from 2001 through 2005, or the Other Restructuring Plans, in an effort to operate more efficiently. As of January 3, 2009, the balance of $6.3 million related to the Other Restructuring Plans consisted solely of estimated lease losses. Facility closure and office space reduction costs included in our restructuring plans are comprised of payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties are abandoned, lease buyout costs and other contractual charges. To estimate the lease loss, which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing all or part of a building, we made certain assumptions related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms, including sublease rates and contractual common area charges. Each reporting period, we evaluate the adequacy of the lease loss accruals related to all of our restructuring plans. When necessary, we adjust the lease loss accruals for changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect estimated costs or sublease income. We also consider executed sublease agreements and adjust the lease loss accruals if sublease income under the agreements differ from initial estimates. The credits recorded in connection with the Other Restructuring Plans during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 relate primarily to changes in lease loss estimates. As of January 3, 2009, our estimate of the accrued lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring plans initiated since 2001 was $8.4 million. This amount will be adjusted in the future if there are changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. The lease loss could range as high as $11.3 million if sublease rental rates decrease in applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty and is especially difficult to predict in light of the current economic challenges and uncertainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. 2008 Restructuring Plan The following table presents restructuring and other charges for the 2008 Restructuring Plan: Severance and Excess Benefits Facilities Other Total (In millions) 2008 $ 44.3 $ 2.3 $ 0.1 $ 46.7 During fiscal 2008, we recorded $44.3 million of headcount reduction costs associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plan, which included severance payments, severance-related benefits and costs for outplacement services. The costs recorded during fiscal 2008 are net of a reversal of $4.9 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to termination and related benefits costs that were less than the initial estimate of $48.1 million recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The net costs recorded during fiscal 2008 include severance and severance-related benefits that were communicated to the affected employees before January 3, 2009 and estimated costs that were both probable and estimable for employees who were notified after January 3, 2009. We provide severance and termination benefits according to the varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in which we operate. In accordance with these regulations, termination benefits of approximately $15.4 million were paid to employees before January 3, 2009 and termination benefits of approximately $29.7 million will be paid after January 3, 2009. We expect to pay substantially all benefits by January 2, 2010. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $150.0 million related to the 2008 Restructuring Plan. 51 Table of Contents Other Restructuring Plans The following table presents restructuring and other charges for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 associated with the Other Restructuring Plans: Severance and Asset- Excess Benefits Related Facilities Total (In millions) 2008 $ ---- $ ---- $ (0.3 ) $ (0.3 ) 2007 ---- ---- (9.7 ) (9.7 ) 2006 (0.1 ) ---- (0.7 ) (0.8 ) During fiscal 2007, we completed a lease termination agreement for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring plan, whereby we paid $8.2 million and were released from all future obligations related to the facility. We recorded a credit to Restructuring and other charges of $7.1 million during the year ended December 29, 2007, representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount paid. Write-off of Acquired In-Process Research and Development Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to expense any acquired in-process research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired in-process research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established. The values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process research and development. The following table summarizes our write-offs of acquired in-process research and development charges during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006: 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) 2006 acquisition $ ---- $ ---- $ 0.9 2007 acquisitions ---- 2.7 ---- 2008 acquisition 0.6 ---- ---- Total in-process research and development $ 0.6 $ 2.7 $ 0.9 The following table summarizes, as of January 3, 2009, the status of in-process research and development acquired during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006: Estimated Expenditures Remaining Incurred to Expenditures Complete In- to Complete Expected Process In-Process Discount Commercial Research and Research and Rates Feasibility Development Development (In millions) 2006 acquisition 33% January 2007 $ 0.3 $ ---- 2007 acquisitions 19% to 21% April 2009 4.3 0.4 2008 acquisition 22% June 2008 0.2 ---- Total Expenditures $ 4.8 $ 0.4 52 Table of Contents Impairment of Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount. For additional description of our goodwill impairment analysis, see the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets,” above. We completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill during the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and we determined at that time that we satisfied the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, and no impairment of goodwill was recorded. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we observed impairment indicators including a further deterioration in the market in which we operate and a decrease in our market capitalization. As such, we determined that certain indicators indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Accordingly, in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements, we completed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and recorded an Impairment of goodwill of $1,317.2 million, representing all of our goodwill. During the third quarters of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, we completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill. Based on the results of these impairment reviews, we determined that no indicators of impairment existed for our one reporting unit and, accordingly, no impairment charge was recognized during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. Impairment of Intangible and Tangible Assets In connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we made certain changes to our DFM product strategy. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $42.5 million arising from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable intangible assets. We also abandoned and impaired $4.6 million of other long-lived assets during fiscal 2008. There were no such impairments during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt We recorded a Loss on extinguishment of debt of $40.8 million during fiscal 2006, which includes a premium paid to repurchase a portion of the 2023 Notes of $38.9 million and a write-off of the related portion of unamortized deferred costs of issuing the 2023 Notes of $1.9 million. Interest Expense 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Interest expense $ 11.6 $ 12.4 $ 12.3 Interest expense decreased $0.8 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to the increase of $0.4 million in capitalized interest relating to a building under construction at our headquarters and a decrease in interest of $0.2 million related to our Term Loan, which was entered into on December 19, 2005 and the repayment of which was completed in March 2007. During 2007, the primary component of Interest expense was the Convertible Senior Notes, which were issued in December 2006. During 2006, the primary component of interest expense was our Term Loan, the repayment of which was completed in March 2007. We expect interest expense to increase during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the inclusion of approximately $20.0 million of non-cash interest expense resulting from our adoption of FSP APB 14-1. In addition, FSP APB 14-1 requires retrospective adoption, which will require us to adjust our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior years to reflect increased interest expense in each of those years. 53 Table of Contents Other Income (Expenses), net Other income (expenses), net, for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Interest income $ 20.4 $ 48.1 $ 39.3 Gains on sale of non-marketable securities 1.6 6.0 19.9 Gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities (7.9 ) 4.4 6.7 Gains (losses) on securities in the non-qualified deferred compensation trust (8.9 ) 7.6 6.4 Gains (losses) on foreign exchange 3.4 (2.4 ) 1.9 Net loss on liquidation of subsidiary (9.3 ) ---- ---- Telos management fees ---- ---- (0.9 ) Equity loss from investments (0.9 ) (3.0 ) (1.2 ) Write-down of investments (16.7 ) (2.6 ) (2.5 ) Other income 1.5 0.4 0.8 Total other income (expenses), net $ (16.8 ) $ 58.5 $ 70.4 The decrease in interest income in 2008, as compared to 2007, was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates. The increase in interest income in 2007, as compared to 2006, was due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates. We expect interest income to decrease during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the expected combination of lower average cash balances and lower interest rates. During fiscal 2008, we determined that two of our available-for-sale securities were other-than-temporarily impaired based on the severity and the duration of the impairments, and we wrote down the investments by $8.1 million. We determined that four of our non-marketable securities were other-than-temporarily impaired during fiscal 2008 and we wrote down the investments by $8.6 million. During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of Mentor Graphics common stock in connection with our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics, we sold our entire equity interest in Mentor Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million. The $9.3 million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment losses, net of gains, previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for a subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 2008. There were no significant gains or losses during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held by Telos Venture Partners, a limited partnership in which we and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust were the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration of $6.53 per share of common stock. In connection with this sale, we received approximately $20.2 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately $17.1 million during fiscal 2006. In addition, our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust received $2.9 million in cash and recorded a gain of $2.5 million during fiscal 2006. Under the purchase agreement, an additional 10% of the consideration was held in escrow, which was released to us and to the trust in January 2007. Upon receipt of these additional proceeds, we recorded a gain of $2.6 million and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust recorded a gain of $0.4 million during fiscal 2007. 54 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (In millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 252.3 $ 67.8 $ 99.7 Effective tax rate (16)% 19% 41% During fiscal 2008, we had a Loss before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, including the impairment of $1,059.7 million of United States goodwill that was non-deductible. We also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by $332.9 million because of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization. In making this judgment, we considered the current year loss that resulted in a cumulative three-year loss and other factors. See discussion below for further details. Further, given the escalating challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008, we decided to repatriate $250.0 million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the United States that had previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which deferred taxes had not been previously provided. We currently expect that an additional $67.2 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries will not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a result, we have accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal, state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations. We intend to indefinitely reinvest the remainder of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $37.8 million as of January 3, 2009 to meet both the working capital and long-term capital needs of our subsidiaries and of Cadence. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $15.5 million as of January 3, 2009. Our effective tax rate was negative for fiscal 2008, as compared to the positive effective tax rates for fiscal 2007, primarily due to the Loss before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and the tax expenses related to the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, repatriations of foreign earnings, impairment of non-deductible goodwill, income of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits. Our effective tax rate decreased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefit of $27.8 million, as a result of the effective settlement of certain tax matters with the IRS in December 2007 and an increase in benefit from foreign income, which is taxed at a lower rate than the United States federal statutory income tax rate, of $30.6 million, resulting from the conclusion of certain transfer pricing arrangements with a foreign subsidiary in 2006. We currently expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be approximately (16.0)%. The effective tax rate is negative because we anticipate having a loss before provision for income taxes and because we expect to have tax expense on the income of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, we currently anticipate recording a valuation allowance that will offset the potential tax benefit of certain tax loss and credit carryforwards generated during fiscal 2009. However, we expect that the effective tax rate for interim reporting periods during fiscal 2009 will vary from the estimated annual effective tax rate because of the recognition of period-specific items of tax expense or benefit such as interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits. Net Deferred Tax Assets and IRS Examinations We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider various sources of taxable income and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. As required by SFAS No. 109, a company’s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook. Under this standard, our current year loss in fiscal 2008, which included the impairment of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets, resulted in a cumulative three-year loss and was considered a significant negative 55 Table of Contents factor. The current year loss, the uncertain and negative market and economic conditions which severely limited our visibility to the timing and extent of an economic recovery, and our expectation of a net loss in the near term were considered significant negative evidence with a high level of objectivity that outweighed our ability to rely on our longer term projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance was needed. Accordingly, we concluded that an increase in valuation allowance of $332.9 million was required as of January 3, 2009. If, in the future, we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made. As of January 3, 2009, we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately $66.4 million. The net deferred tax assets are primarily composed of United States net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The net deferred tax assets are presented gross of unrecognized tax benefits, which are not directly associated with the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although we cannot guarantee that we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the net deferred tax assets over time. In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an RAR in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period. The proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately $152.0 million. The remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income. The IRS may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future examinations. We have filed a timely protest with the IRS and are seeking resolution of the issues with the Appeals Office. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between 4% and 10% since 2001. The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005. Significant judgment is required in applying the principles of FIN No. 48 and SFAS No. 109. The calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations. However, the final outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be estimated with certainty. In addition, we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination, we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods. 56 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents and Short-term investments $ 572.1 $ 1,078.1 $ 958.4 $ (506.0 ) $ 119.7 Net working capital 390.3 744.1 763.9 (353.7 ) (19.8 ) Cash provided by operating activities 70.3 402.4 421.2 (332.1 ) (18.8 ) Cash used for investing activities (126.9 ) (108.4 ) (111.8 ) (18.5 ) 3.4 Cash used for financing activities (443.4 ) (170.1 ) (233.9 ) (273.3 ) 63.8 Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments As of January 3, 2009, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $572.1 million of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments, as compared to $1,078.1 million as of December 29, 2007 and $958.4 million as of December 30, 2006. Our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were: • Customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or lease of our hardware products; • Customer payments for engineering services; • Proceeds from the sale of receivables; • Cash received for common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan; and • Proceeds from the exercise of stock options during fiscal 2007. Our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were: • Payments relating to salary, benefits, other employee-related costs and other operating expenses, including our restructuring plans; • Purchases of treasury stock as part of our stock repurchase program; • Repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the amount of $230.2 million pursuant to their terms; • Purchases of property, plant and equipment; and • Payments to former shareholders of acquired businesses. Our existing Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investment balances may decline during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, and continue to decline during fiscal 2009, in the event of a further deterioration in the economy or the capital markets, a reduction in our cash receipts or changes in our cash outlays. However, we expect that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. 57 Table of Contents Net Working Capital Net working capital decreased $353.7 million as of January 3, 2009, as compared to December 29, 2007, and $19.8 million as of December 29, 2007, as compared to December 30, 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents $ (494.7 ) $ 128.6 Prepaid expenses and other (38.9 ) 16.3 Current portion of deferred revenue (37.9 ) (4.9 ) Receivables, net (27.5 ) 87.8 Convertible notes 230.4 (230.4 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 28.8 (30.1 ) Other individually insignificant items (13.9 ) 12.9 $ (353.7 ) $ (19.8 ) Cash and cash equivalents decreased as of January 3, 2009 primarily due to $230.2 of principal payments on our 2023 Notes and $274.0 million of repurchases of our common stock. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $332.1 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and $18.8 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Net income (loss), net of non-cash related gains and losses $ (545.1 ) $ 105.9 Proceeds from the sale of receivables, net (163.2 ) 34.9 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effect of acquired businesses 376.2 (159.6 ) $ (332.1 ) $ (18.8 ) Cash flows provided by operating activities include net income (loss), adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels, the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our receivables. As a result of challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other regions of the world, our customers, who are concentrated in the semiconductor sector, have experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business and as a result, may delay purchasing our products and services or delay or default on their payment obligations. If our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. Our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. Though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financial institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During fiscal 2008, we transferred accounts receivable, net of the losses on the sale of the 58 Table of Contents receivables, totaling $52.2 million, which approximated fair value, to financial institutions on a non-recourse basis, as compared to $215.4 million during fiscal 2007 and $180.6 million during fiscal 2006. As a result of the credit losses recorded by banks during 2008 and the current financial challenges experienced by banks, a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about over-exposure to the technology sector. In addition, the change in our license mix will result in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions, so we expect a reduced level of Proceeds from the sale of receivables throughout fiscal 2009. Due to the lower order levels and the reduced level of sale of receivables, we do not expect positive net cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2008, we initiated the 2008 Restructuring Plan to decrease costs by reducing our workforce across the company and by consolidating facilities where the workforce reductions resulted in excess office space. This restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by at least 625 positions and we recorded Restructuring and other charges of $46.4 million during fiscal 2008. As of January 3, 2009, we had made payments in connection with the 2008 Restructuring Plan in the amount of $15.6 million. We expect substantially all termination benefits to be paid by January 2, 2010. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $150.0 million related to the 2008 Restructuring Plan. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our primary investing activities consisted of: • Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment; • Purchases of available-for-sale securities; • Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and acquisition of intangibles; and • Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities and long-term investments. Net cash used for investing activities increased $18.5 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and decreased $3.4 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Purchases of available-for-sale securities $ (62.4 ) $ ---- Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment (46.5 ) 46.2 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (15.5 ) (14.2 ) Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and acquisition of intangibles 59.8 (14.9 ) Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities 50.1 (1.4 ) Other individually insignificant items (4.0 ) (12.3 ) $ (18.5 ) $ 3.4 In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings. During the lease term, we constructed an additional building located on our San Jose, California campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction. We expect to use approximately $5.6 million in cash in fiscal 2009 in connection with the completion of construction of this new building. We expect decreased cash payments for Property, plant and equipment during fiscal 2009 as the new building is complete. During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of Mentor Graphics common stock for $62.4 million in connection with our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics we sold our entire equity interest in Mentor Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million. 59 Table of Contents In connection with our acquisitions completed before January 3, 2009, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $51.0 million in cash during the next 44 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full, which would be expensed as compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, purchasing software licenses and making long-term equity investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Financing cash flows during fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock, the repurchase of our 2023 Notes and the issuance of common stock under certain employee plans. Net cash used for financing activities increased by $273.3 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, and decreased $63.8 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to the following: Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (In millions) Principal payments of our notes due 2023 $ (230.2 ) $ 228.5 Proceeds from the issuance of common stock (207.3 ) 98.8 Purchases of treasury stock 125.5 94.6 Payments on our term loan 28.0 104.0 Proceeds from receivable sale financing 18.0 ---- Proceeds from issuance of convertible notes due 2011 and 2013 ---- (500.0 ) Purchases and sales of call options and warrants in connection with convertible notes due 2011 and 2013 and convertible notes due 2023 ---- 34.7 Other individually insignificant items (7.3 ) 3.2 $ (273.3 ) $ 63.8 The decrease in Proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, is due to fewer stock option exercises resulting from lower stock prices. The decrease in Purchases of treasury stock during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, is due to a lower cost to repurchase shares. We record a gain or loss on re-issuance of treasury stock based on the total proceeds received in the transaction. During fiscal 2008, we recorded losses on the re-issuance of treasury stock of $110.6 million as a component of Retained earnings. As of January 3, 2009, we have $854.4 million remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources Income Taxes Given the escalating challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008, we decided to repatriate $250.0 million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the United States that had previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which deferred taxes had not been previously provided. We currently expect to repatriate an additional $67.2 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries in future periods. We expect that our available net operating losses and foreign tax credits will offset any current year income taxes related to the dividends paid during fiscal 2008. We intend to indefinitely reinvest the remainder of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $37.8 million as of January 3, 2009, to meet both the working capital and long-term capital needs of its subsidiaries and of Cadence. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $15.5 million as of January 3, 2009. 60 Table of Contents During fiscal 2008, we also increased our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by $332.9 million because of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. The valuation allowance will not result in current or future tax payments. For additional description of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, see the discussion under the heading “Results of Operations — Provision for Income Taxes,” above. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received a RAR in which the IRS proposed to assess a tax deficiency. For additional description of our IRS Examinations, see the discussion under the heading “Results of Operations — Provision for Income Taxes,” above. As of January 3, 2009, we had current income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $5.7 million. As of January 3, 2009, we had long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $288.0 million. For additional information on the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, see the discussion under the heading “Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements,” below. 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes, and $250.0 million principal amount of 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively, the Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The indentures for the Convertible Senior Notes do not contain any financial covenants. We received net proceeds of approximately $487.0 million after transaction fees of approximately $13.0 million, including $12.0 million of underwriting discounts. A portion of the net proceeds totaling $228.5 million was used to purchase $189.6 million principal amount of our 2023 Notes. Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events: • The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes; • Specified corporate transactions occur; or • The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below 98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of our common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on that date. On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. We may not redeem the Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity. The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is 47.2813 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $21.15 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each day, during a specified observation period following the conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of the observation period consists of: • Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and • Our common stock to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity and provided that our stock price is greater than $18.00 per share, the conversion rate will increase by an additional amount of up to $8.27 per share, for a holder that elects to convert its Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such fundamental change, which amount will be paid entirely in cash. A fundamental change is any transaction or event (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) in 61 Table of Contents which more than 50% of our common stock is exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive, consideration. No fundamental change will have occurred if at least 90% of the consideration received consists of shares of common stock, or depositary receipts representing such shares, that are: • Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or • Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national securities exchange. As of January 3, 2009, none of the conditions allowing the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met. Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each December 15th and June 15th. Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with various parties whereby we have the option to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $21.15 per share, subject to adjustment. These options expire on December 15, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and December 15, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net shares. The aggregate cost of these hedge transactions was $119.8 million and has been recorded as a reduction to Stockholders’ equity in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock.” The estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was $11.6 million as of January 3, 2009. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity. In separate transactions, we also sold warrants to various parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2012 through April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes, and February 2014 through April 2014 in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net shares. We received $39.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants, which has been recorded as a reduction to Stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF No. 00-19. The estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was $7.5 million as of January 3, 2009. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these warrants will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity. The warrants will be included in diluted earnings per share, or EPS, to the extent the impact is dilutive. Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023 In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act. We received net proceeds of $406.4 million after transaction fees of $13.6 million that were recorded in Other long-term assets and were being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over five years. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in December 2006, we repurchased $189.6 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes and in August 2008, we repurchased $230.2 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes upon election of the holders of the 2023 Notes pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Notes, for total consideration of $230.8 million, reducing the outstanding 2023 Notes balance to $0.2 million as of January 3, 2009. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions, all of which expired during fiscal 2008 and no settlement was required. 62 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of January 3, 2009 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less More Total Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Than 5 Years (In millions) Operating lease obligations $ 96.1 $ 29.5 $ 33.6 $ 16.0 $ 17.0 Purchase obligations 13.3 13.0 0.3 ---- ---- 2023 Notes* 0.2 ---- ---- 0.2 ---- Convertible Senior Notes 500.0 ---- 250.0 250.0 ---- Contractual interest payments 29.1 7.2 14.4 7.5 ---- Current income tax payable and Unrecognized tax benefits 9.8 9.8 ---- ---- ---- Other long-term contractual obligations u 245.0 ---- 235.1 7.6 2.3 Total $ 893.5 $ 59.5 $ 533.4 $ 281.3 $ 19.3 * The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash the remaining portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount. Therefore, we have included $0.2 million of principal of the 2023 Notes on the potential repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the 3 to 5 Years column in the above table. u Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $288.0 million, and of that amount we estimate that $212.9 million will be paid within 1 to 3 years. We did not include the remaining long-term income tax liabilities of $75.1 million in the table above, because we estimated that this liability can be offset by available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and that future cash payments will not be required to settle this liability. However, the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing of such tax payments may depend upon the resolution of current and future tax examinations which cannot be estimated with certainty. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily acquisition-related liabilities. With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of January 3, 2009 or the earliest cancellation date. In connection with our acquisitions completed before January 3, 2009, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $51.0 million in cash during the next 44 months if certain predefined performance goals are achieved in full. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 3, 2009, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. New Accounting Standards In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement),” which will require us to recognize additional non-cash interest expense related to our Convertible Senior Notes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal 2009 and is required to be applied retrospectively for all periods for which our Convertible Senior Notes were outstanding before the date of adoption. FSP APB 14-1 will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, particularly with respect to interest expense ratios commonly referred to by lenders, and could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity 63 Table of Contents securities. We expect interest expense to increase during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the inclusion of approximately $20.0 million of non-cash interest expense resulting from our adoption of FSP APB 14-1. In addition, FSP APB 14-1 requires retrospective adoption, which will require us to adjust our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior years to reflect increased interest expense in each of those years. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets.” FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under SFAS No. 142. This new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. Since this guidance will be applied prospectively, on adoption, there will be no impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,” which requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information that should enable financial statement users to understand how and why a company uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Because SFAS No. 161 only requires additional disclosure, the adoption will not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business Combinations” and SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51.” SFAS No. 141R will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of FSP FAS No. 157-2. We adopted SFAS No. 157 at the beginning of fiscal 2008, except as it applies to those non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities as described in FSP FAS No. 157-2. We adopted SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities on the first day of fiscal 2009. Since the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities will be applied prospectively, on adoption, there will be no impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and costs associated with foreign currency hedges. 64 Table of Contents We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of January 3, 2009. The following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified as Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 3, 2009. Carrying Average Value Interest Rate (In millions) Interest-Bearing Instruments: Cash equivalents – variable rate $ 432.9 1.22% Cash – variable rate 59.8 0.60% Cash – fixed rate 50.2 1.05% Total interest-bearing instruments $ 542.9 1.14% Foreign Currency Risk Most of our revenue, expenses and material business activity are transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening United States dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets. Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures. The following table provides information, as of January 3, 2009, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of 65 Table of Contents the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured during January 2009. Weighted Average Notional Contract Principal Rate (In millions) Forward Contracts: British pound sterling $ 34.6 0.68 Japanese yen 31.6 93.50 European Union euro 22.4 0.78 Indian rupee 9.3 49.23 Israeli shekel 8.4 3.93 New Taiwan dollar 8.1 33.54 Canadian Dollar 6.4 1.27 Hong Kong dollar 6.4 7.75 Singapore dollar 3.8 1.50 Total $ 131.0 N/A Estimated fair value $ 2.7 While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Equity Price Risk 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes and collectively, the Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions, sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For additional description of the Convertible Senior Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see the discussion under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources” under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” above. Investments We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. The fair value of our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable equity securities, which are included in Short-term investments on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $3.6 million as of January 3, 2009 and $14.9 million as of December 29, 2007. While we actively monitor these investments, we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in. 66 Table of Contents Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we own, would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be able to liquidate a particular investment when desired. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $18.7 million as of January 3, 2009 and $26.2 million as of December 29, 2007. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists for a non-marketable equity security, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write-down as an investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.",2023-12-30 20:47:24.542185
813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements. Business Overview We develop EDA software and hardware. We license software, sell or lease hardware technology, provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide engineering and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate product development processes for electronics. Our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ICs and electronics systems. During Fiscal 2009, we had orders of $615 million. We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from IC manufacturers and designers and electronics systems companies and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects. As a result, our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers’ business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income (loss), as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes and allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software and hardware products when all of the following criteria are met: • We have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; • Delivery of all specified products has occurred; • The fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable, at the outset of the arrangement; and • Collectibility of the fee is probable. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and that judgment can impact the amount of revenue that we recognize in a reporting period. We must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses and we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments, products 31 Table of Contents or services. However, we have concluded that fees are not fixed or determinable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries. For installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment, we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable and are collectible. Such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our experience has been that we are generally able to estimate whether collection is probable. Significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment. If we were unable to determine that collection is probable, such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A multiple element arrangement, or MEA, is any arrangement that includes or contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware products, software license types, services, training or maintenance in a single arrangement. From time to time, we may include individual deliverables in separately priced and separately signed contracts with the same customer. We obtain and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, a MEA. Significant judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of contracts might be so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement. For our subscription licenses, including “eDA Platinum Cards,” the software license agreements typically combine the right to use specified software products, the right to maintenance, and the right to receive and use unspecified future software products for no additional fee, when and if available, during the term of the license agreement. Under these license agreements, when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning with delivery of the first product. Subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to maintenance revenue is based on the average substantive renewal rates included in the sale of similar term license arrangements. In the event that the license fee for this type of arrangement is not considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, we recognize revenue at the lesser of (i) the pro-rata portion of the license fee for the applicable period, or (ii) as payments from the customer become due (if all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied). For term and perpetual licenses, including “eDA Gold Cards,” when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met, software license fees are recognized as revenue, generally with product fees associated with the specified products recognized “up-front” upon completion of delivery, and with the maintenance fees recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period. Under our current business model, a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an up-front basis. License agreements under which software fees are recognized up-front do not include the right to receive unspecified future software products. However, in the event such license agreements are executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer, the licenses together may be deemed a MEA, in which event all such revenue would be recognized over multiple periods. Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all 32 Table of Contents revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements using the asset and liability method. We also apply a two-step approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision (benefit) for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision (benefit) for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this assessment, we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified. For example, a company’s current year or previous year losses are given more weight than its future outlook. For the years ended January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, we concluded that a significant valuation allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence. If, in the future, we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part, of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made. For additional description of the valuation allowance, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. To determine if a tax position is effectively settled, we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed. We must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal year-end. These judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We are also required to assess whether the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. As of January 2, 2010, we had recognized a deferred tax liability of $34.7 million related 33 Table of Contents to $67.9 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. To calculate the tax liability for the repatriation of these earnings, we are required to estimate the geographic mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income and dividend withholding tax rates, the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the potential outcomes of current and future tax audits. Changes in our actual or projected operating results, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, foreign exchange rates and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. This allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers, historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve. While we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions, which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected change in a customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customer’s payment trends, are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. As a result of our assessment of increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations, we have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to $23.7 million as of January 2, 2010, as compared to $7.5 million as of January 3, 2009. Results of Operations Overview of Fiscal 2009 Our fiscal 2009 financial results reflected the following: • Continuing pressures on the research and development budgets in our customer base that are used to license, purchase or lease EDA products or services; • Lower business levels due to the challenging macroeconomic environment and the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers; • Lower business levels and up-front revenue recognized due to our transition to a license mix with a higher proportion of ratable revenue, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2008; • Decreased costs throughout the company as a result of our restructuring plans and other expense reductions; • An increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers, as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations; and • Our retrospective adoption of new accounting principles, as required by the “Debt with Conversion and Other Options” subtopic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, increasing interest expense for all periods presented. Revenue We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services. We principally utilize three license types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types provide a customer with different conditions of use for our products, such as: • The right to access new technology; • The duration of the license; and • Payment timing. 34 Table of Contents The timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of orders executed in any given period. For some orders, such as subscription orders, product and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over multiple periods. In addition, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of particular orders, we have some orders where product and maintenance revenue is recognized as payments become due and some where revenue is only recognized when payment is received. For other orders, all product revenue is recognized up-front in the same quarter in which the order is executed. We seek to achieve a mix of orders with approximately 90% of the total value of all executed orders consisting of orders for which the revenue is recurring, or ratable in nature, with the balance of the orders made up of orders for which the product revenue is recognized up-front. During fiscal 2009, approximately 90% of the total value of our executed orders was comprised of ratable revenue orders. If we achieve this desired mix of executed orders over time and there are no significant changes to our business, eventually approximately 90% of our revenue would come from ratable orders. Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use, this will result in either a subscription or term license. A business implication of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Historically, larger customers generally used products from two or more of our five product groups and rarely completely terminated their relationship with us upon expiration of the license. See the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates – Revenue Recognition” and Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional descriptions of license types and timing of revenue recognition. Although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period, we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: • Competitiveness of our new technology; • Timing of contract renewals with existing customers; • Length of our sales cycle; and • Size, duration, terms and type of: • Contract renewals with existing customers; • Additional sales to existing customers; and • Sales to new customers. The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription, term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms. The timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements with existing customers (e.g., customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements to term license arrangements). Revenue Mix We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. During fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, our product groups were as follows: Functional Verification: Products in this group, including the Incisive functional verification platform, are used to verify that the high level, logical representation of an IC design is functionally correct. Digital IC Design: Products in this group, including the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to accurately convert the high-level, logical representation of a digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the IC will be physically implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors. Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, including the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for ICs that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, RF, memory, high performance digital blocks and 35 Table of Contents standard cell libraries. Detailed design information showing how an IC will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors. System Interconnect Design: This product group consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro and OrCAD® products. The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co-design of interconnects across ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions. Design for Manufacturing: Included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the IC has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. Our strategy includes focusing on integrating DFM awareness into our core design platforms of Encounter digital IC design and Virtuoso custom design. For additional description of our current product strategy, see the discussion under the heading “Products and Product Strategy” under Item 1, “Business.” Revenue by Year The following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 and the dollar change in revenue between years: Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In millions) Product $ 400.8 $ 516.6 $ 1,104.0 $ (115.8 ) $ (587.4 ) Services 106.5 133.5 125.8 (27.0 ) 7.7 Maintenance 345.3 388.5 385.2 (43.2 ) 3.3 Total revenue $ 852.6 $ 1,038.6 $ 1,615.0 $ (186.0 ) $ (576.4 ) Product revenue decreased during each of fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment, the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers, our transition to a ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle. As a result, product revenue decreased for all product groups, and particularly for Digital IC Design, Custom IC Design and Functional Verification products during both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. We expect to recognize increased revenue during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher business levels and our continued transition to our more ratable business model. Services revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment and an increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers, primarily as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations. Maintenance revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: • Lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment; • An increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers, primarily as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations; and • A decline in maintenance fees resulting from a reduction in the average duration of software license arrangements, because the annual fee for maintenance is lower for arrangements with shorter durations. 36 Table of Contents The following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and Services and other during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Functional Verification 22% 22% 24% Digital IC Design 21% 24% 27% Custom IC Design 27% 24% 27% System Interconnect Design 11% 11% 8% Design for Manufacturing 7% 6% 6% Services and other 12% 13% 8% Total 100% 100% 100% As described under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates,” certain of our licenses allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have licensed a combination of our products to customers with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the above table would differ. Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement. Revenue by Geography Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In millions) United States $ 370.0 $ 435.1 $ 741.9 $ (65.1 ) $ (306.8 ) Other Americas 20.9 33.0 34.8 (12.1 ) (1.8 ) Europe, Middle East and Africa 188.9 230.8 296.9 (41.9 ) (66.1 ) Japan 152.8 204.1 342.6 (51.3 ) (138.5 ) Asia 120.0 135.6 198.8 (15.6 ) (63.2 ) Total revenue $ 852.6 $ 1,038.6 $ 1,615.0 $ (186.0 ) $ (576.4 ) Revenue by Geography as a Percentage of Total Revenue 2009 2008 2007 United States 43% 42% 46% Other Americas 3% 3% 2% Europe, Middle East and Africa 22% 22% 19% Japan 18% 20% 21% Asia 14% 13% 12% No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by $7.8 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in the value of the United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen, partially offset by an increase in the value of the United States dollar when compared to the British pound and the European Union euro. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by $24.5 million in fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in the value of the United States 37 Table of Contents dollar when compared to the Japanese yen and the European Union euro, partially offset by an increase in the value of the United States dollar when compared to the British pound. Additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock-based Compensation Expense Summary Stock-based compensation expense is reflected throughout our costs and expenses during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Cost of product $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 Cost of services 3.3 4.3 3.9 Cost of maintenance 2.1 2.8 2.5 Marketing and sales 12.3 17.4 22.2 Research and development 26.4 36.7 46.3 General and administrative 10.5 19.9 26.3 Total $ 54.7 $ 81.3 $ 101.4 Stock-based compensation expense decreased by $26.6 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and $20.1 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: • Newly granted restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, collectively referred to as restricted stock, and stock options have lower fair values, primarily due to our lower stock price; • The decrease in the number of unvested restricted stock and stock options due to a reduction in headcount associated with our restructuring plans and the resignation of certain executives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008; • The decrease in the maximum purchase limits under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and a lower fair value of purchase rights granted; and • A decrease in stock bonuses. Stock-based compensation expense during fiscal 2008 also decreased, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the reversal of $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the modification of certain performance-based restricted stock awards, partially offset by an increase in stock option expense due to the acceleration of vesting of certain executives that resigned during fiscal 2008. We expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to decrease during fiscal 2010, primarily due to lower fair values at grant dates for restricted stock and stock options, the cancellation of restricted stock and stock options as a result of our restructuring plans and other attrition, and a reduced number of equity grants during fiscal 2010. Effects of Restructuring Plans We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels. To offset some of the impact of the decrease in our revenue, we have implemented cost savings initiatives, including reducing headcount and related costs and reducing other discretionary spending. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue. This restructuring plan decreased costs during fiscal 2009 by reducing our workforce throughout the company by approximately 625 positions. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $150.0 million related to the restructuring activities and other expense reductions initiated in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, we initiated an additional restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue. The 2009 restructuring plan, which we initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and continued during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by approximately 345 positions. We expect ongoing annual savings of 38 Table of Contents approximately $30.0 million related to the restructuring activities initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring plan-related annual operating expense savings related to the 2009 restructuring activities that we initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and announced in January 2010, will be offset by increased spending in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these and our prior restructuring plans. Cost of Revenue Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In millions) Product $ 32.1 $ 50.3 $ 60.1 $ (18.2 ) $ (9.8 ) Services 90.5 103.3 93.4 (12.8 ) 9.9 Maintenance 46.6 55.8 61.1 (9.2 ) (5.3 ) The following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Product 8 % 10 % 5 % Services 85 % 77 % 74 % Maintenance 13 % 14 % 16 % Cost of services as a percentage of Services revenue increased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to decreased Services revenue during fiscal 2009 as noted above. Cost of Product Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products, the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials, assembly and overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software product. A summary of Cost of product during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 is as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Product related costs $ 27.8 $ 33.0 $ 37.8 Amortization of acquired intangibles 4.3 17.3 22.3 Total Cost of product $ 32.1 $ 50.3 $ 60.1 39 Table of Contents Cost of product decreased by $18.2 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and $9.8 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2008 2007 (In millions) Hardware costs $ (4.5 ) $ (5.8 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles (13.0 ) (5.0 ) Other individually insignificant items (0.7 ) 1.0 $ (18.2 ) $ (9.8 ) Hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales and a write-off of obsolete inventory that did not recur during fiscal 2009. Hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales, partially offset by a write-off of obsolete inventory during fiscal 2008. Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the impairment of certain acquired intangibles during fiscal 2008. Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized during the related periods. Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to decreased software product revenue during fiscal 2008. Cost of Services Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services decreased by $12.8 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and increased $9.9 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ (10.2 ) $ 3.3 Facilities and other infrastructure costs (0.4 ) 1.9 Portion of the gain on the sale of land and building that relates to Cost of services expense ---- 1.1 Other discretionary spending (2.2 ) 3.6 $ (12.8 ) $ 9.9 Cost of Maintenance Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, and documentation of maintenance updates. Cost of maintenance 40 Table of Contents decreased by $9.2 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and $5.3 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2008 2007 (In millions) Salary, benefit and other employee-related costs $ (6.2 ) $ (4.6 ) Other discretionary spending (3.0 ) (0.7 ) $ (9.2 ) $ (5.3 ) Operating Expenses Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In millions) Marketing and sales $ 286.8 $ 358.4 $ 407.1 $ (71.6 ) $ (48.7 ) Research and development 354.7 457.9 494.0 (103.2 ) (36.1 ) General and administrative 122.7 152.0 169.0 (29.3 ) (17.0 ) Total operating expenses $ 764.2 $ 968.3 $ 1,070.1 $ (204.1 ) $ (101.8 ) Operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to reduced headcount and related costs as a result of our 2008 and 2009 restructuring plans, and our cost savings initiatives to reduce discretionary spending. In addition, fiscal 2008 was a 53-week fiscal year, while fiscal 2009 was a 52-week fiscal year. Operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to reduced headcount and related costs and our cost savings initiatives to reduce discretionary spending. During fiscal 2007, we recognized a gain on the sale of land and buildings that related to, and accordingly reduced, operating expense for that period. There was no similar reduction during fiscal 2008. The following table shows operating expenses as percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Marketing and sales 34% 35% 25% Research and development 42% 44% 31% General and administrative 14% 15% 10% Our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to our lower Product revenue during the period. 41 Table of Contents Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expense decreased by $71.6 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and $48.7 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (In millions) Salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs $ (39.3 ) $ (44.7 ) Facilities and other infrastructure costs (9.8 ) 3.2 Travel and customer conference costs (8.4 ) (5.9 ) Stock-based compensation (5.1 ) (4.8 ) Professional services costs (3.4 ) 1.0 Executive severance costs (1.5 ) 1.5 Portion of the gain on the sale of land and building that relates to Marketing and sales expense ---- 3.0 Other discretionary spending (4.1 ) (2.0 ) $ (71.6 ) $ (48.7 ) Research and Development Research and development expense decreased by $103.2 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and $36.1 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ (71.4 ) $ (26.8 ) Stock-based compensation (10.3 ) (9.6 ) Facilities and other infrastructure costs (9.7 ) 3.1 Computer equipment lease costs and maintenance costs associated with third-party software (5.5 ) 3.0 Travel costs (3.4 ) (3.5 ) Professional services costs (1.9 ) (7.3 ) Executive severance costs (1.1 ) 1.1 Portion of the gain on the sale of land and building that relates to Research and development expense ---- 5.1 Other discretionary spending 0.1 (1.2 ) $ (103.2 ) $ (36.1 ) 42 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expense decreased by $29.3 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, and $17.0 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2008 2007 (In millions) Legal and other professional services costs $ (13.0 ) $ (3.0 ) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs (10.5 ) (12.1 ) Stock-based compensation (9.4 ) (6.4 ) Executive severance costs (6.7 ) 6.7 Facilities and other infrastructure costs (6.2 ) (0.1 ) Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables (5.4 ) (7.7 ) Impairment of property, plant and equipment 5.4 0.4 Bad debt expense 16.3 6.2 Other discretionary spending 0.2 (1.0 ) $ (29.3 ) $ (17.0 ) Legal and other professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in professional services fees related to our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics Corporation and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008 that did not recur during fiscal 2009. See additional discussion of our current litigation in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and other professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to litigation costs incurred during fiscal 2007 that did not recur during fiscal 2008, partially offset by increased professional services fees related to our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics Corporation and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008. Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a reduction in sales of receivables. The change in our license mix has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions because we generally do not sell the receivables associated with subscription licenses. Also, as a result of the credit losses recorded by banks during 2008 and 2009 and the financial challenges experienced by banks, a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about over-exposure to the technology sector. Bad debt expense increased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, because certain of our customers experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business, which has resulted and may continue to result in a delay or default on their payment obligations. Executive severance costs during fiscal 2008 relate to the cash payable to three of the five executives who resigned in October 2008. The expense related to the other two resignations of executives is included in our Sales and marketing and Research and development expenses. 43 Table of Contents Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In millions) Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 11.4 $ 22.7 $ 19.4 $ (11.3 ) $ 3.3 Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $11.3 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and increased $3.3 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2008 2007 (In millions) Increase due to additions of acquired intangibles $ ---- $ 6.0 Decrease due to impairment of intangibles during 2008 (9.5 ) ---- Decrease due to completed amortization of acquired intangibles (1.8 ) (2.7 ) $ (11.3 ) $ 3.3 Restructuring and Other Charges We have initiated multiple restructuring plans since 2001, including a 2009 restructuring plan which includes restructuring activities initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 as well as restructuring activities initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and announced in January 2010. These restructuring activities initiated during fiscal 2009 are together referred to as the 2009 Restructuring Plan. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these restructuring plans. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty and is especially difficult to predict in light of the current economic challenges and uncertainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. 2009 Restructuring Plan We have recorded total costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan of $35.1 million. The costs recorded as part of the 2009 Restructuring Plan include severance payments, severance-related benefits and costs for outplacement services that were communicated to the affected employees before January 2, 2010, and estimated severance payments and related benefits that were both probable and estimable as of January 2, 2010 for employees notified after January 2, 2010. Total severance and termination benefits of approximately $16.3 million related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan were paid to employees before January 2, 2010. Approximately $18.6 million of severance and termination benefits related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan will be paid after January 2, 2010, all of which is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 2, 2010. Due to varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in which we operate, we expect substantially all termination benefits to be paid by January 1, 2011. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $30.0 million related to the restructuring activities initiated during the second quarter of 2009. We expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring plan-related annual operating expense savings related to the 2009 restructuring activities which we initiated during the fourth quarter of 2009 and announced in January 2010 will be offset by increased spending in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies. 44 Table of Contents 2008 Restructuring Plan The following table presents Restructuring and other charges for the 2008 Restructuring Plan: Severance and Excess Benefits Facilities Other Total (In millions) Fiscal 2009 $ (3.0 ) $ 0.5 $ ---- $ (2.5 ) Fiscal 2008 $ 44.3 $ 2.3 $ 0.1 $ 46.7 During fiscal 2008, we recorded $44.3 million of headcount reduction costs associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plan, including severance payments, severance-related benefits and costs for outplacement services, substantially all of which was paid by January 2, 2010. During fiscal 2009, we recorded a net reversal of $2.5 million, consisting of reversals of $3.0 million in termination and related benefits costs that were less than initially estimated and $1.4 million of excess facilities costs due to a reduction in the estimated lease obligation associated with a facility vacated as part of the 2008 Restructuring Plan, partially offset by restructuring expense of $1.9 million related to facilities included in the 2008 Restructuring Plan that we exited during fiscal 2009. Other Restructuring Plans We recorded credits to Restructuring and other charges (credits) of $1.2 million during fiscal 2009, $0.3 million during fiscal 2008 and $9.7 million during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2009, we recorded a release of $1.2 million of excess facilities costs due to a reduction in the estimated lease obligation associated with a facility vacated as part of the 2002 Restructuring Plan and a reduction in other facilities costs that were less than initially estimated. During fiscal 2007, we completed a lease termination agreement for a facility included in the 2001 Restructuring Plan, whereby we paid $8.2 million and were released from all future obligations related to the facility. We recorded a credit to Restructuring and other charges of $7.1 million during fiscal 2007, representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount paid. Impairment of Goodwill We conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount. We completed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and recorded an Impairment of goodwill of $1,317.2 million, representing all of our goodwill. For additional description of our impairment of goodwill, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Intangible and Tangible Assets In connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we made certain changes to our DFM product strategy. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $42.5 million arising from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable intangible assets. We also abandoned and impaired $4.6 million of other long-lived assets during fiscal 2008. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 As Adjusted As Adjusted (In millions) Interest expense $ 28.9 $ 27.4 $ 28.3 45 Table of Contents On the first day of fiscal 2009, we adopted new accounting principles as required by the “Debt with Conversion and Other Options” subtopic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires issuers of certain types of convertible notes to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. This retroactive adoption required us to adjust our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior years to reflect increased interest expense in each of those years. The primary components of Interest expense for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 consisted of the non-cash component associated with the amortization of the debt discount as required under these new accounting principles and the contractual interest expense of our Convertible Senior Notes. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Interest income $ 2.6 $ 20.4 $ 48.1 Gains on sale of non-marketable securities ---- 1.6 6.0 Gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities 2.3 (7.9 ) 4.4 Gains (losses) on securities in the non-qualified deferred compensation trust (1.0 ) (8.9 ) 7.6 Gains (losses) on foreign exchange 0.4 3.4 (2.4 ) Net loss on liquidation of subsidiary ---- (9.3 ) ---- Equity loss from investments (0.5 ) (0.9 ) (3.0 ) Write-down of investments (5.2 ) (16.7 ) (2.6 ) Other income 0.4 1.5 0.4 Total other income (expense), net $ (1.0 ) $ (16.8 ) $ 58.5 The decrease in interest income during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates. We determined that certain of our non-marketable securities were other-than-temporarily impaired and we wrote down the investments by $5.2 million during fiscal 2009, $8.6 million during fiscal 2008 and $2.6 million during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we determined that two of our available-for-sale securities were other-than-temporarily impaired based on the severity and the duration of the impairments, and we wrote down the investments by $8.1 million. All of these impairments are included in the Write-down of investments line in the above table. During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of Mentor Graphics common stock in connection with our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics during fiscal 2008, we sold our entire equity interest in Mentor Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million, which is included in the Gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities line in the above table. The $9.3 million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment losses, net of gains, previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for a subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 2008. 46 Table of Contents Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rates during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 As Adjusted As Adjusted (In millions, except percentages) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (3.6) $ 239.2 $ 61.4 Effective tax rate 2% (15)% 18% During fiscal 2009, a change in United States federal tax law allowed companies to elect to carry back the fiscal 2009 net operating loss for a period of three, four or five years instead of the general two-year carryback period. Our benefit for income taxes during fiscal 2009 is primarily due to $27.3 million of tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 United States federal net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in prior years, that is partially offset by current year interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of $13.3 million, and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest related to prior year tax positions of $14.5 million. With the exception of the fiscal 2009 United States federal net operating loss that can be utilized in prior years, we recorded a valuation allowance that offset the tax benefit from other fiscal 2009 United States losses and tax credits. The $14.5 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest during fiscal 2009 included $7.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest that should have been recognized during multiple periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008. The effects on our fiscal 2009 results and our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods are not considered material. We had a fiscal 2008 provision for income taxes, primarily due to the significant fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill, the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings. During fiscal 2008, we recognized the impairment of $1,059.7 million of United States goodwill that was non-deductible. We also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by $326.0 million because of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization. In making this judgment, we considered the fiscal 2008 loss that resulted in a cumulative three-year loss and other factors. Finally, given the challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008, we decided that $317.2 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries would not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a result, we accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal, state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations. Our effective tax rate was negative for fiscal 2008, as compared to the positive effective tax rate for fiscal 2007, primarily due to the fiscal 2008 Loss before provision for income taxes and the fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill, the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings. The fiscal 2007 effective tax rate reflects the $27.8 million tax benefit from the fiscal 2007 effective settlement of the IRS Exam for the 1997-1999 tax years. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 to be negative. Our expectation excludes the impact of possible effective settlements of tax examinations that may occur during fiscal 2010. The effective tax rate is negative because we expect to record a loss before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2010 and because we expect to have tax expense on the income of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, we currently anticipate recording a valuation allowance that will offset the potential tax benefit of certain tax loss and credit carryforwards generated during fiscal 2010. We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $79.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 2, 2010, to meet the working capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $35.3 million as of January 2, 2010. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We concluded that a valuation 47 Table of Contents allowance of $383.2 million was required as of January 2, 2010. This represents an increase in valuation allowance of $52.0 million in comparison with the year ended January 3, 2009. If, in the future, we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received RARs indicating that the IRS has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies. For further discussion regarding our Income taxes, including the calculation of our valuation allowance, our deferred tax assets, and the status of the IRS examinations, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 As Adjusted As Adjusted (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents and Short-term investments $ 571.3 $ 572.1 $ 1,078.1 $ (0.8 ) $ (506.0 ) Net working capital 452.8 389.8 743.4 63.0 (353.6 ) Cash provided by operating activities 25.6 70.3 402.4 (44.7 ) (332.1 ) Cash used for investing activities (50.5 ) (126.9 ) (108.4 ) 76.4 (18.5 ) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities 21.0 (443.4 ) (170.1 ) 464.4 (273.3 ) Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments As of January 2, 2010, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $571.3 million of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments, as compared to $572.1 million as of January 3, 2009 and $1,078.1 million as of December 29, 2007. Our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were: • Customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or lease of our hardware products; • Customer payments for services; • Cash received for common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan; and • Proceeds from the sale of receivables during fiscal 2008. Our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were: • Payments relating to salary, benefits, other employee-related costs and other operating expenses, including our restructuring plans; • Purchases of property, plant and equipment; • Payments to former shareholders of acquired businesses; • Purchases of treasury stock as part of our stock repurchase program during fiscal 2008; and • Repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the amount of $230.2 million pursuant to their terms during fiscal 2008. We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. 48 Table of Contents Net Working Capital Net working capital increased $63.0 million as of January 2, 2010, as compared to January 3, 2009, and decreased $353.6 million as of January 3, 2009, as compared to December 29, 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2008 2007 As Adjusted (In millions) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 110.9 $ 28.8 Current portion of deferred revenue 55.4 (37.9 ) Cash and cash equivalents 0.9 (494.7 ) Prepaid expenses and other (0.1 ) (38.8 ) Receivables, net (98.0 ) (27.5 ) Convertible notes ---- 230.4 Other individually insignificant items (6.1 ) (13.9 ) $ 63.0 $ (353.6 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $44.7 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and $332.1 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2008 2007 (In millions) Net income (loss), net of non-cash related gains and losses $ 55.0 $ (545.1 ) Proceeds from the sale of receivables, net (46.4 ) (163.2 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effect of acquired businesses (53.3 ) 376.2 $ (44.7 ) $ (332.1 ) Cash flows from operating activities include Net income (loss), adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels, the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our receivables. As a result of the challenging economic environment, our customers, who are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor sector, have experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business and as a result, may delay purchasing our products and services or delay or default on their payment obligations. Approximately half of our total Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables, net as of January 2, 2010 relate to ten of our customers. If our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. Our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. Though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financial institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis. During fiscal 2009, we transferred accounts receivable to financial institutions on a non-recourse basis, totaling $5.8 million, net of the losses on the sale of the receivables, as compared to $52.2 million during fiscal 2008 and $215.4 million during fiscal 2007. The change in our license mix 49 Table of Contents has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and, therefore, a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions. For additional information regarding our sales of receivables, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2008 and the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities and we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $180.0 million related to these restructuring activities and other expense reductions. In January 2010, we announced additional restructuring activities that we initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We expect that substantially all of the estimated annual operating expense savings associated with the restructuring activities announced in January 2010 will be offset by increased spending in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies. As of January 2, 2010, we had made payments in connection with these restructuring plans in the amount of $59.1 million and we expect to pay an additional amount of $20.8 million. We expect substantially all termination benefits related to these restructuring plans to be paid by January 1, 2011. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our primary investing activities during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 consisted of: • Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment; • Purchases of available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2008; • Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and acquisition of intangibles; and • Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities and long-term investments. Net cash used for investing activities decreased $76.4 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, and increased $18.5 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2008 2007 (In millions) Purchases of available-for-sale securities $ 62.4 $ (62.4 ) Purchases of property, plant and equipment 56.0 (15.5 ) Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and acquisition of intangibles 6.8 59.8 Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment 3.9 (46.5 ) Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities (52.4 ) 50.1 Other individually insignificant items (0.3 ) (4.0 ) $ 76.4 $ (18.5 ) In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings. During the lease term, we constructed an additional building on our San Jose, California campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction. The decrease in cash payments for Property, plant and equipment during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, is primarily due to the completion of this new building in January 2009. During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of Mentor Graphics common stock for $62.4 million in connection with our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics we sold our entire equity interest in Mentor Graphics for $53.0 million. 50 Table of Contents In connection with our acquisitions completed before January 2, 2010, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $15.9 million in cash during the next 32 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full, of which $8.1 million would be included as compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, purchasing software licenses, business combinations, and making long-term equity investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Financing cash flows during fiscal 2009 consisted primarily of the issuance of common stock under certain employee plans. Net cash provided by financing activities was $21.0 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $443.4 million during fiscal 2008, and $170.1 million during fiscal 2007. The changes in our financing cash flows are due to the following: Change 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2008 2007 (In millions) Purchases of treasury stock $ 274.0 $ 125.5 Principal payments of our notes due 2023 230.2 (230.2 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock (20.2 ) (207.3 ) Proceeds from receivable sale financing (18.0 ) 18.0 Payments on our term loan ---- 28.0 Other individually insignificant items (1.6 ) (7.3 ) $ 464.4 $ (273.3 ) The decrease in Proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, is primarily due to decreased purchase limits under our ESPP, which became effective during fiscal 2009. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during fiscal 2009. As of January 2, 2010, we had $854.4 million remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased $230.2 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes upon election of the holders of the 2023 Notes pursuant to the terms thereof, for total consideration of $230.8 million. We record a gain or loss on re-issuance of treasury stock based on the total proceeds received in the transaction. During fiscal 2009, we recorded losses on the re-issuance of treasury stock of $213.4 million as a component of Retained earnings (Accumulated deficit). Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources Income Taxes We provide for United States income taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. As of January 2, 2010, we had recognized a deferred tax liability of $34.7 million related to $67.9 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which we have previously made a provision for income tax. We repatriated $50.0 million of the $67.9 million during January 2010 and expect to repatriate $12.9 million of the remainder during fiscal 2010. We estimate that the fiscal 2010 repatriations will result in fiscal 2010 cash tax payments of approximately $2.2 million. We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $79.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 2, 2010, to meet the working capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign 51 Table of Contents subsidiaries. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $35.3 million as of January 2, 2010. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received RARs pursuant to which the IRS has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies. For additional description of our IRS Examinations, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of January 2, 2010, we had current income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $3.9 million. As of January 2, 2010, we had long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $313.6 million. For additional information on the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, see the discussion under the heading “Contractual Obligations.” 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes and $250.0 million of our 2013 Notes. Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and, in separate transactions, sold warrants to purchase our common stock to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. The 2011 Notes mature on December 15, 2011 and the 2013 Notes mature on December 15, 2013, and the principal amounts will be paid in cash at maturity. For additional description of the Convertible Senior Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of January 2, 2010 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less More Total Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Than 5 Years (In millions) Operating lease obligations $ 84.6 $ 24.4 $ 30.3 $ 13.2 $ 16.7 Purchase obligations 20.3 19.0 0.9 0.4 ---- 2023 Notes(1) 0.2 ---- ---- 0.2 ---- Convertible Senior Notes 500.0 ---- 250.0 250.0 ---- Contractual interest payments 21.9 7.2 10.9 3.8 ---- Current income tax payable and Unrecognized tax benefits 8.0 8.0 ---- ---- ---- Other long-term contractual obligations(2) 237.8 ---- 232.4 2.5 2.9 Total $ 872.8 $ 58.6 $ 524.5 $ 270.1 $ 19.6 (1) The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash the remaining portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount. Therefore, we have included $0.2 million of principal of the 2023 Notes on the potential repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the 3-5 Years column in the above table. (2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $313.6 million, and of that amount we estimate that $215.9 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years. We did not include the remaining long-term income tax liabilities of $97.7 million in the table above, because we estimated that this liability can be offset by available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and that future cash payments will not be required to settle this liability. However, the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing of such tax payments may depend upon the resolution of current and future tax examinations that cannot be estimated with certainty. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily acquisition-related liabilities. 52 Table of Contents With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of January 2, 2010 or the earliest cancellation date. In connection with our acquisitions completed before January 2, 2010, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $15.9 million in cash during the next 32 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 2, 2010, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. New Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting standards for multiple-deliverable arrangements and for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements. The new standards for multiple-deliverable arrangements enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on: (a) vendor-specific objective evidence; (b) third-party evidence; or (c) estimates. This guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. In addition, this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. Under the new standards for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements, tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality are excluded from the pre-existing software revenue guidance. In addition, hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are always excluded from the pre-existing software revenue guidance. We are currently evaluating the application to our revenue arrangements of the two new accounting standards described above. The impact of these new standards may result in revenue being recognized for certain sales of hardware and nonsoftware-related deliverables separate from the software deliverables within a multiple element arrangement. Both of these new standards are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified during fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with the option to provide retrospective presentation for prior years, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt these two new accounting standards during our first quarter of fiscal 2011. In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity. These new standards amend the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and require ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The provisions of the new standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 and interim periods within those fiscal years. These standards will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact that these new standards will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk Most of our revenue, expenses and material business activity are transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening United States dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase 53 Table of Contents in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets. Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures. The following table provides information, as of January 2, 2010, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured during January 2010. Weighted Average Notional Contract Principal Rate (In millions) Forward Contracts: Japanese yen $ 29.9 91.69 European Union euro 14.2 0.69 Indian rupee 13.4 46.64 Canadian Dollar 10.6 1.06 Israeli shekel 10.2 3.77 New Taiwan dollar 7.6 32.19 Hong Kong dollar 6.8 7.75 British pound sterling 2.1 0.62 Total $ 94.8 N/A Estimated fair value $ (0.5 ) While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges. 54 Table of Contents We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk, and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of January 2, 2010. The following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified as Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 2, 2010. Carrying Average Value Interest Rate (In millions) Interest-Bearing Instruments: Cash equivalents – variable rate $ 446.3 0.13% Cash – variable rate 41.7 0.27% Cash – fixed rate 47.6 0.67% Total interest-bearing instruments $ 535.6 0.19% Equity Price Risk 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes and $250.0 million of our 2013 Notes to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions, sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For additional description of the Convertible Senior Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Investments We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these investments. 55 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:47:28.662710
813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements. Business Overview We develop EDA software, hardware, and silicon IP. We license software and IP, sell or lease hardware technology, provide maintenance for our software, IP and hardware and provide engineering and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate product development processes for electronics. Our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ICs and electronics systems. During fiscal 2010, we had orders of $956 million. We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software and IP, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our products and providing engineering services. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from IC and electronics systems manufacturers and designers and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects. As a result, our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers’ business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of intangible assets, valuation of goodwill and fair value have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software, IP and hardware products when all of the following criteria are met: • We have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; • Delivery of all specified products has occurred; • The fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable, at the outset of the arrangement; and • Collectibility of the fee is probable. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. We must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses and we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments, products or services. 30 Table of Contents For installment contracts that do not include a substantial up-front payment, we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our experience has been that we are generally able to estimate whether collection is probable. Significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. If our experience were to change, such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer. A multiple element arrangement, or MEA, is any arrangement that includes or contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware products, software license types, services, training or maintenance in a single arrangement. From time to time, we may include individual deliverables in separately priced and separately signed contracts with the same customer. We obtain and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, a MEA. Significant judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of contracts might be so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement. For our subscription licenses, including “eDA Platinum Cards,” the software license agreements typically combine the right to use specified software products, the right to maintenance, and the right to receive and use unspecified future software products for no additional fee, when and if available, during the term of the license agreement. Under these license agreements, when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning with delivery of the products. Subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to maintenance revenue is based on the average substantive renewal rates included in the sale of similar term license arrangements. In the event that the license fee for this type of arrangement is not considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, we recognize revenue at the lesser of (i) the pro-rata portion of the license fee for the applicable period, or (ii) as payments from the customer become due (if all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied). For term and perpetual licenses, including “eDA Gold Cards,” that include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate, software license fees are recognized as revenue “up-front” when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met, generally upon delivery, and the maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period. Under our current business model, a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an up-front basis. License agreements under which license fees are recognized up-front do not include the right to receive unspecified future products. However, when such license agreements are executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer, the licenses together may be deemed a MEA, in which event all such revenue is recognized over multiple periods. Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. 31 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements using the asset and liability method. We also apply a two-step approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision (benefit) for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision (benefit) for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this assessment, we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified. For example, a company’s current year or previous year losses are given more weight than its future outlook. For the years ended January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, we concluded that a significant valuation allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence. If, in the future, we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part, of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made. For an additional description of the valuation allowance, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. To determine if a tax position is effectively settled, we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed. We must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal year-end. These judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for other reasons. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In addition, we are required by the IRS to disclose uncertain tax positions taken on our federal tax return for fiscal 2010. We are also required to assess whether the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. As of January 1, 2011, we had recognized a deferred tax liability of $5.2 million related to $8.6 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. Changes in our actual or projected operating results, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, foreign 32 Table of Contents exchange rates and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. This allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers, historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve. While we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions, which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected change in a customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customer’s payment trends, are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. During fiscal 2009, we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by $21.6 million as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations. As a result of receiving payments related to a portion of the outstanding receivables against which we had previously recorded allowances, we have decreased our allowance for doubtful accounts to $7.6 million as of January 1, 2011, as compared to $23.7 million as of January 2, 2010. Of the $7.6 million allowance for doubtful accounts as of January 1, 2011, $6.9 million relates to one customer whose outstanding gross accounts receivable balance is due in the first half of 2011. If we recover any portion of that $6.9 million, it will result in a reduction of our operating expenses. Valuation of Intangible Assets When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to acquired tangible assets and liabilities and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset’s carrying amount. In addition, we assess our long-lived assets for impairment if they are abandoned. For long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired intangibles, we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset, excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment is required in: • Identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances; • Forecasting future operating results; and • Estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long-lived or intangible assets. In future periods, material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made. 33 Table of Contents Valuation of Goodwill Costs in excess of the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss. The preparation of the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the determination of fair values of the reporting unit and tangible and intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions, which include future values, are complex and often subjective and may differ significantly from period to period based on changes in the overall economic environment, changes in our industry and changes in our strategy or our internal forecasts. Estimates and assumptions with respect to the fair value determination include: • Control premium assigned to our market capitalization; • Our operating forecasts; • Revenue growth rates; • Risk-commensurate discount rates and costs of capital; and • Market multiples of revenue and earnings. These estimates and assumptions, along with others, are used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit as well as tangible and intangible assets. While we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable, different assumptions may materially impact the resulting fair value of the reporting unit, tangible assets and intangible assets, the amount of impairment we record in any given period and our results of operations. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair-value hierarchy: • Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; • Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and • Level 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. This hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. We recognize transfers between levels of this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period for financial instruments that are carried at fair value. The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency, are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 34 Table of Contents In June 2010, we entered into hedge transactions, or the 2015 Notes Hedges, and recorded an embedded conversion derivative, or the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative, concurrent with the issuance of the 2015 Notes. The fair values of these derivatives are determined using an option pricing model based on observable inputs, such as implied volatility of our common stock, risk-free interest rate and other factors, and as such are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For an additional description of these transactions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. For those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, our best estimate is used. Results of Operations Overview of Fiscal 2010 Financial results for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, reflect the following: • Our customers remain cautious about making substantial new expenditures to purchase or lease EDA products or services despite growth in the semiconductor industry and some stabilization in the overall economic environment during 2010; • Increased revenue recognized because of higher business levels due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers and from contracts executed in prior years due to our continued transition to a ratable license mix, which began in the third quarter of fiscal 2008; • A decrease in our bad debt expense due to the prior year increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and the current year release of a portion of the reserve as a result of customer payments of certain receivables that were previously included in our allowance for doubtful accounts; • An increase in employee-related costs for commissions and other employee incentive compensation primarily resulting from improving business levels during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, partially offset by decreased costs as a result of our prior year restructuring plans and other expense reductions; • The acquisition of Denali including an increase in deferred tax liabilities from the intangible assets acquired with Denali and the resulting benefit for income taxes because of the release of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets; • Effective settlement of the IRS examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002, which resulted in a benefit for income taxes of $147.9 million during fiscal 2010; • The issuance of $350.0 million principal amount of our 2015 Notes, and the repurchase of $100.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes, and $105.5 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes; and • On February 8, 2011 and February 11, 2011, we agreed to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation, respectively. Accordingly, we recorded Litigation charges of $15.8 million in fiscal 2010. Acquisition of Denali In June 2010, we acquired Denali, a privately-held provider of electronic design automation software and intellectual property used in system-on-chip design and verification, for $296.8 million in cash. An additional $12.6 million of payments were deferred on the acquisition date and conditioned upon certain Denali shareholders remaining employees of Cadence during the periods specified in the respective agreements. As of January 1, 2011, $10.5 million of the $12.6 million has been paid. During fiscal 2010, $10.2 million of the $12.6 million was expensed in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $2.4 million will be expensed in our Consolidated Statements of Operations over the stated retention periods. The Denali® product portfolio includes memory models, design IP and verification IP. The impact of the Denali acquisition on our Statement of Operations in fiscal 2010 resulted in a greater increase in our operating expenses than the increase in revenue generated from the acquisition. 35 Table of Contents Revenue We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software and IP, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, IP and hardware and providing engineering services. We principally use three license types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types provide a customer with different conditions of use for our products, such as: • The right to access new technology; • The duration of the license; and • Payment timing. The timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of orders executed in any given period. For some orders, such as subscription orders, product and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over multiple periods. In addition, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of a particular order, we have some orders for which product and maintenance revenue is recognized as payments become due and some for which revenue is only recognized when payment is received. For other orders, all product revenue is recognized up-front in the same quarter in which the order is executed. We seek to achieve a mix of orders with approximately 90% of the total value of all executed orders consisting of orders for which the revenue is recurring, or ratable in nature, with the balance of the orders made up of orders for which the product revenue is recognized up-front. Our ability to achieve this ratable orders mix may be impacted by an increase in hardware sales beyond our current expectations. For an additional description of the impact of hardware sales on the anticipated mix of orders, see “New Accounting Standards” below. During fiscal 2010, approximately 90% of the total value of our executed orders was comprised of ratable revenue orders. Approximately 90% of our fiscal 2010 revenue came from ratable orders. Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use, this will result in either a subscription or term license. A business implication of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Historically, larger customers generally have used products from two or more of our five product groups and rarely completely terminated their relationship with us upon expiration of the license. See the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates – Revenue Recognition” and Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional descriptions of license types and timing of revenue recognition. Although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period, we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: • Competitiveness of our new technology; • Timing of contract renewals with existing customers; • Length of our sales cycle; and • Size, duration, terms and type of: • Contract renewals with existing customers; • Additional sales to existing customers; and • Sales to new customers. The value and renewal of contracts, and consequently product revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription, term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms. Revenue Mix 36 Table of Contents We analyze our software, IP and hardware businesses by product group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies in “platforms,” as described in the various product groups below: Functional Verification: Products in this group, including the Incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the high level, logical representation of an IC design is functionally correct and for verification at the system and SoC levels. Our emulation hardware products, verification IP products, memory sub-system models, and silicon IP products are included in this product group, as are the products acquired through the Denali acquisition. Digital IC Design: Products in this group, including the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to create and convert the high-level, logical representation of a digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the IC will be physically implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors. Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, including the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for ICs that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, RF, memory, high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries. Included in this group are specialized verification products that simulate the operation of the design prior to manufacturing. Detailed design information showing how an IC will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors. System Interconnect Design: This product group consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro and OrCAD® products. The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co-design of interconnects across ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions. Design for Manufacturing: Included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the IC has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. Our strategy includes focusing on integrating DFM awareness into our core design platforms of Encounter digital IC design and Virtuoso custom IC design. For an additional description of our current product strategy, see the discussion under the heading “Products and Product Strategy” under Item 1, “Business.” Revenue by Year The following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and the dollar change in revenue between years: Change 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In millions) Product $ 471.6 $ 400.8 $ 516.6 $ 70.8 $ (115.8 ) Services 100.9 106.5 133.5 (5.6 ) (27.0 ) Maintenance 363.5 345.3 388.5 18.2 (43.2 ) Total revenue $ 936.0 $ 852.6 $ 1,038.6 $ 83.4 $ (186.0 ) Product revenue increased during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily because of higher business levels due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers and from contracts executed in prior quarters due to our continued transition to a ratable license mix. We expect to recognize increased revenue during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to higher business levels and our continued transition to our more ratable license mix. Product revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment, the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers, our transition to a ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle. 37 Table of Contents Services revenue decreased during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily because of lower business levels in the services business. Services revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment and an increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers, primarily as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations. Maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily because of higher business levels due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers. Maintenance revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to 2008, due to lower business levels as a result of challenges in the macroeconomic environment, an increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers, primarily as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations and a decline in maintenance fees resulting from a reduction in the average duration of software license arrangements, because the annual fee for maintenance is lower for arrangements with shorter durations. The following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and Services and other during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008: 2010 2009 2008 Functional Verification 24% 22% 22% Digital IC Design 23% 21% 24% Custom IC Design 26% 27% 24% System Interconnect Design 9% 11% 11% Design for Manufacturing 7% 7% 6% Services and other 11% 12% 13% Total 100% 100% 100% As described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement. Revenue by Geography Change 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In millions) United States $ 382.7 $ 370.0 $ 435.1 $ 12.7 $ (65.1 ) Other Americas 22.2 20.9 33.0 1.3 (12.1 ) Europe, Middle East and Africa 207.2 188.9 230.8 18.3 (41.9 ) Japan 165.2 152.8 204.1 12.4 (51.3 ) Asia 158.7 120.0 135.6 38.7 (15.6 ) Total revenue $ 936.0 $ 852.6 $ 1,038.6 $ 83.4 $ (186.0 ) 38 Table of Contents Revenue by Geography as a Percentage of Total Revenue 2010 2009 2008 United States 41% 43% 42% Other Americas 2% 3% 3% Europe, Middle East and Africa 22% 22% 22% Japan 18% 18% 20% Asia 17% 14% 13% No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, and we recognize additional revenue in periods when the United States dollar weakens in value against the Japanese yen and reduced revenue in periods when the United States dollar strengthens against the Japanese yen. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements, see the discussion under the heading “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.” Stock-based Compensation Expense Summary Stock-based compensation expense is reflected in our costs and expenses during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Cost of product $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 Cost of services 2.2 3.3 4.3 Cost of maintenance 1.4 2.1 2.8 Marketing and sales 9.8 12.3 17.4 Research and development 18.4 26.4 36.7 General and administrative 11.6 10.5 19.9 Total $ 43.5 $ 54.7 $ 81.3 Stock-based compensation expense decreased by $11.2 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased by $26.6 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: • Newly granted restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, collectively referred to as restricted stock, and stock options had lower grant date fair values than the grant date fair value of restricted stock and stock options that became fully amortized during the related periods; • The decrease in the maximum purchase limits under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and a lower grant date fair value of purchase rights granted; and • A decrease in stock bonuses. Effects of Restructuring Plans During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we initiated a restructuring plan, or the 2010 Restructuring Plan, which we announced in February 2011. The 2010 Restructuring Plan is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by approximately 95 positions. We expect ongoing annual savings of $14.5 million related to the 2010 Restructuring Plan. We expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring plan-related annual operating expense savings related to the 2010 restructuring activities will be offset by increased costs in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies. During fiscal 2009, we initiated a restructuring plan, or the 2009 Restructuring Plan, to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue. The 2009 Restructuring Plan reduced our workforce throughout the company by approximately 345 positions. 39 Table of Contents During fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue. This restructuring plan reduced our workforce throughout the company by approximately 625 positions. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of the 2010, 2009 and 2008 restructuring plans. Cost of Revenue Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions) Product $ 31.4 $ 32.1 $ 50.3 $ (0.7 ) $ (18.2 ) Services 83.0 90.5 103.3 (7.5 ) (12.8 ) Maintenance 42.1 46.6 55.8 (4.5 ) (9.2 ) The following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008: 2010 2009 2008 Product 7 % 8 % 10 % Services 82 % 85 % 77 % Maintenance 12 % 13 % 14 % Cost of services as a percentage of Services revenue increased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to decreased Services revenue during fiscal 2009 as noted above. Cost of Product Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software and IP products. Cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products, the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials, assembly and overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products. A summary of Cost of product during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 is as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Product related costs $ 25.8 $ 27.8 $ 33.0 Amortization of acquired intangibles 5.6 4.3 17.3 Total Cost of product $ 31.4 $ 32.1 $ 50.3 40 Table of Contents Cost of product decreased by $0.7 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased by $18.2 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions) Hardware costs $ (1.4 ) $ (4.5 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles 1.3 (13.0 ) Other individually insignificant items (0.6 ) (0.7 ) $ (0.7 ) $ (18.2 ) Hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales and a write-off of obsolete inventory that did not recur during fiscal 2009. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in Cost of product increased during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Denali acquisition. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in Cost of product decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the impairment of certain acquired intangibles during fiscal 2008. Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period. We expect Cost of product to increase in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to expected increases in hardware revenue in 2011 and due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with the Denali acquisition. Cost of Services Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services decreased by $7.5 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased by $12.8 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ (3.4 ) $ (10.2 ) Stock-based compensation (1.1 ) (1.0 ) Professional services (1.0 ) (0.6 ) Other individually insignificant items (2.0 ) (1.0 ) $ (7.5 ) $ (12.8 ) Cost of Maintenance Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such as telephonic and on-site support, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, and documentation of maintenance updates, as well as amortization of intangible assets directly related to our maintenance contracts. Cost of maintenance decreased 41 Table of Contents by $4.5 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased by $9.2 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions) Amortization of acquired intangibles $ (3.1 ) $ — Facilities and other infrastructure costs (1.4 ) (1.0 ) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs 1.3 (6.2 ) Other individually insignificant items (1.3 ) (2.0 ) $ (4.5 ) $ (9.2 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased by $3.1 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized. Operating Expenses Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions) Marketing and sales $ 305.6 $ 286.8 $ 358.4 $ 18.8 $ (71.6 ) Research and development 376.4 354.7 457.9 21.7 (103.2 ) General and administrative 86.4 122.7 152.0 (36.3 ) (29.3 ) Total operating expenses $ 768.4 $ 764.2 $ 968.3 $ 4.2 $ (204.1 ) The increase in our operating expenses during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, is primarily due to higher employee-related costs, including the additional costs related to our acquisition of Denali, which primarily affected our Research and development expenses. These costs include ongoing Denali operating expenses and expenses related to deferred Denali acquisition payments. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of the deferred Denali acquisition payments. Our operating expenses also increased during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, due to higher salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs because of improved business levels that resulted in increased sales commissions and other employee incentive compensation. The increases in operating expenses related to our acquisition of Denali and increased employee-related costs were partially offset by the decrease in bad debt expense during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, that we recorded in our General and administrative expenses, and by decreased employee-related costs due to our restructuring activities. Bad debt expense decreased by $38.1 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, due to recording allowances for doubtful accounts of $21.6 million during fiscal 2009 and releasing $16.5 million of the reserve during fiscal 2010, as a result of collections on certain receivables that were previously included in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to reduced headcount and related costs as a result of our 2008 and 2009 restructuring plans, and our cost savings initiatives to reduce discretionary spending. In addition, fiscal 2008 was a 53-week fiscal year, while fiscal 2009 was a 52-week fiscal year. We expect operating expenses to increase in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to the significant release of our allowances for doubtful accounts in fiscal 2010, which we do not expect to recur in fiscal 2011. We also expect increases in salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs in fiscal 2011, as compared 42 Table of Contents to fiscal 2010, because we expect to include a full year of expenses associated with the employment of former Denali employees and also expect the anticipated improvements in our business to result in higher incentive compensation. The following table shows operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008: 2010 2009 2008 Marketing and sales 33% 34% 35% Research and development 40% 42% 44% General and administrative 9% 14% 15% Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expense increased by $18.8 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased by $71.6 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions) Salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs $ 19.5 $ (39.3 ) Professional services costs 1.4 (3.4 ) Travel and customer conference costs 0.8 (8.4 ) Facilities and other infrastructure costs (0.2 ) (9.8 ) Stock-based compensation (2.5 ) (5.1 ) Depreciation (4.4 ) (4.3 ) Other individually insignificant items 4.2 (1.3 ) $ 18.8 $ (71.6 ) Research and Development Research and development expense increased by $21.7 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased by $103.2 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ 35.5 $ (71.4 ) Facilities and other infrastructure costs 2.0 (9.7 ) Travel costs 1.3 (3.4 ) Professional services costs (0.1 ) (1.9 ) Other discretionary (4.6 ) 0.8 Computer equipment lease costs and maintenance costs associated with third-party software (4.5 ) (5.5 ) Stock-based compensation (8.0 ) (10.3 ) Other individually insignificant items 0.1 (1.8 ) $ 21.7 $ (103.2 ) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in Research and development expense include operating expenses associated with deferred Denali acquisition payments. We recorded Research and development 43 Table of Contents expense of $10.2 million related to these deferred Denali acquisition payments during fiscal 2010. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of the deferred Denali acquisition payments. General and Administrative General and administrative expense decreased by $36.3 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased by $29.3 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions) Bad debt expense $ (38.1 ) $ 16.3 Impairment of property, plant and equipment (5.6 ) 5.4 Facilities and other infrastructure costs (3.5 ) (6.2 ) Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables (0.4 ) (5.4 ) Legal and other professional services costs 0.6 (13.0 ) Executive severance costs 1.1 (6.7 ) Stock-based compensation 1.1 (9.4 ) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs 6.6 (10.5 ) Other individually insignificant items 1.9 0.2 $ (36.3 ) $ (29.3 ) Bad debt expense decreased by $38.1 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, due to recording allowances for doubtful accounts of $21.6 million during fiscal 2009 and releasing $16.5 million of the reserve during fiscal 2010 as a result of collections on certain receivables that were previously included in our allowance for doubtful accounts. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of our allowance for doubtful accounts. Legal and other professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in professional services fees related to our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics Corporation and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008 that did not recur during fiscal 2009. For an additional description of our current litigation, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to a reduction in sales of receivables. The change in our license mix has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions because we generally do not sell the receivables associated with subscription licenses. Executive severance costs during fiscal 2008 relate to the cash payable to three of the five executives who resigned in October 2008. The expense related to the other two resignations of executives is included in our Sales and marketing and Research and development expenses. We expect General and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to the significant release of our allowances for doubtful accounts in fiscal 2010, which we do not expect to recur in fiscal 2011. 44 Table of Contents Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Change 2010 vs. 2009 vs 2010 2009 2008 2009 . 2008 (In millions) Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 14.2 $ 11.4 $ 22.7 $ 2.8 $ (11.3 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles increased $2.8 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased $11.3 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2009 2008 (In millions) Increase due to additions of acquired intangibles $ 5.1 $ ---- Decrease due to impairment of intangibles during 2008 ---- (9.5 ) Decrease due to completed amortization of acquired intangibles (2.3 ) (1.8 ) $ 2.8 $ (11.3 ) We expect Amortization of acquired intangibles to increase in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with the Denali acquisition. Restructuring and Other Charges We have initiated multiple restructuring plans since 2001, including a 2010 Restructuring Plan. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of these restructuring plans. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. 2010 Restructuring Plan During fiscal 2010, we recorded Restructuring and other charges associated with the 2010 Restructuring Plan of $13.2 million. Of the $13.2 million, $9.1 million is comprised of estimated severance payments, severance-related benefits and costs for outplacement services that we determined were both probable and estimable as of January 1, 2011. The costs relate to approximately 95 employees who were notified after January 1, 2011. All of the $9.1 million of accrued severance and associated benefits is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2011. Because of varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in which we operate, these workforce reductions will be realized during fiscal 2011 and are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2011. As part of the 2010 Restructuring Plan, we determined we would change our research and development plans related to certain purchased software technology and related assets. We evaluated the net realizable value of these assets and recorded an impairment charge of $3.5 million. During fiscal 2010, and as part of the 2010 Restructuring Plan, we recorded a lease loss accrual of $0.4 million related to a facility we consolidated and had vacated prior to January 1, 2011. We expect to record an additional $1.0 million to $2.0 million in restructuring expenses related to consolidating facilities included in the 2010 Restructuring Plan as we vacate those facilities in future periods. 45 Table of Contents We expect ongoing annual savings of $14.5 million related to the restructuring activities we initiated during the fourth quarter of 2010 and announced in February 2011. We expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring plan-related annual operating expense savings related to the 2010 restructuring activities will be offset by increased costs in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies. The following table presents Restructuring and other charges for the 2010 Restructuring Plan: Severance Assets and Excess and Benefits Facilities Other Total (In millions) Fiscal 2010 $ 9.1 $ 0.4 $ 3.7 $ 13.2 2009 Restructuring Plan The following table presents Restructuring and other charges for the 2009 Restructuring Plan: Severance and Excess Benefits Facilities Other Total (In millions) Fiscal 2010 $ (3.9 ) $ 0.4 $ 0.1 $ (3.4 ) Fiscal 2009 35.1 ---- ---- 35.1 We have recorded total costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan of $31.7 million, primarily related to severance payments, severance-related benefits and costs for outplacement services. As of January 1, 2011, we had paid substantially all of the severance payments related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan. During fiscal 2010, we recorded a net credit of $3.4 million, consisting of a credit of $3.9 million in termination and related benefits costs that were less than initially estimated and a $0.4 million charge related to facilities included in the 2009 Restructuring Plan that we vacated during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and $0.1 million for assets related to these vacated facilities. 2008 Restructuring Plan The following table presents Restructuring and other charges for the 2008 Restructuring Plan: Severance and Excess Benefits Facilities Other Total (In millions) Fiscal 2010 $ ---- $ 0.1 $ ---- $ 0.1 Fiscal 2009 (3.0 ) 0.5 ---- (2.5 ) Fiscal 2008 $ 44.3 $ 2.3 $ 0.1 $ 46.7 We have recorded total costs associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plan of $44.3 million, primarily related to severance payments, severance-related benefits and costs for outplacement services. As of January 1, 2011, we had paid substantially all of the severance payments related to the 2008 Restructuring Plan. 46 Table of Contents Other Restructuring Plans The following table presents Restructuring and other charges for the Other Restructuring Plans: Excess Facilities (In millions) Fiscal 2010 $ 0.3 Fiscal 2009 (1.2 ) Fiscal 2008 $ (0.3 ) The activity in the Other Restructuring Plans in each of fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 relates solely to changes in estimates related to lease loss accruals. Litigation Charges On February 8, 2011 and February 11, 2011, we agreed to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation, respectively, subject to completion of final settlement documentation by the parties and court approval. Accordingly, we recorded Litigation charges of $15.8 million in fiscal 2010, which is total settlement costs of $40.0 million, net of $24.2 million we expect will be paid by our insurance carriers. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of our legal proceedings and this settlement. Impairment of Goodwill We conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount. We completed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and recorded an Impairment of goodwill of $1,317.2 million, representing all of our goodwill at that time. For an additional description of our impairment of goodwill, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Intangible and Tangible Assets In connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we made certain changes to our DFM product strategy. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $42.5 million arising from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable intangible assets. We also abandoned and impaired $4.6 million of other long-lived assets during fiscal 2008. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Contractual cash interest expense: Convertible Senior Notes $ 5.6 $ 7.2 $ 7.3 2015 Notes 5.0 ---- ---- Amortization of debt discount: Convertible Senior Notes 16.1 19.4 18.6 2015 Notes 7.0 ---- ---- Amortization of deferred financing costs: Convertible Senior Notes 1.3 1.6 1.6 2015 Notes 0.9 ---- ---- Capitalized interest expense (0.2 ) (0.5 ) (2.7 ) Other interest expense 0.6 1.2 2.6 Total interest expense $ 36.3 $ 28.9 $ 27.4 47 Table of Contents The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, is due to interest expense related to the 2015 Notes that were issued in June 2010. For an additional description of our 2015 Notes and Convertible Senior Notes, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to incur a full year of interest expense related to the 2015 Notes during fiscal 2011. As a result, we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Interest income $ 1.2 $ 2.6 $ 20.4 Gains on sale of non-marketable securities 4.9 ---- 1.6 Gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and short-term investments 0.1 2.3 (7.9 ) Gains (losses) on securities in the non-qualified deferred compensation trust 2.6 (1.0 ) (8.9 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (5.7 ) ---- ---- Gains on foreign exchange 0.4 0.4 3.4 Net loss on liquidation of subsidiary ---- ---- (9.3 ) Equity loss from investments (0.1 ) (0.5 ) (0.9 ) Write-down of investments (1.5 ) (5.2 ) (16.7 ) Other income 0.6 0.4 1.5 Total other income (expense), net $ 2.5 $ (1.0 ) $ (16.8 ) During fiscal 2010, we recorded gains totaling $4.9 million for five cost method investments that were liquidated. We also repurchased a portion of our Convertible Senior Notes and recorded a loss for the early extinguishment of debt. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of this loss. The decrease in interest income during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates. We determined that certain of our non-marketable securities were other-than-temporarily impaired and we wrote down the investments by $1.5 million during fiscal 2010, $5.2 million during fiscal 2009 and $8.6 million during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we determined that two of our available-for-sale securities were other-than-temporarily impaired based on the severity and the duration of the impairments, and we wrote down the investments by $8.1 million. All of these impairments are included in the Write-down of investments line in the table above. During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of Mentor Graphics common stock in connection with our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics during fiscal 2008, we sold our entire equity interest in Mentor Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million, which is included in the Gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities line in the table above. The $9.3 million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment losses, net of gains, previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for a subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 2008. 48 Table of Contents Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rates during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (189.3) $ (3.6) $ 239.2 Effective tax rate 302% 2% (15)% Our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes is primarily because of the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest of $147.9 million as a result of our effective settlement of certain tax matters with the IRS in August 2010 and the release of $66.7 million of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of intangibles with Denali in June 2010. Our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes included $4.6 million of tax expense for uncertain tax positions that should have been recognized during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. The effect of this tax expense on our Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2010 and on our Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 is not considered material. During fiscal 2009, a change in United States federal tax law allowed companies to elect to carry back the fiscal 2009 net operating loss for a period of three, four or five years instead of the general two-year carryback period. Our benefit for income taxes during fiscal 2009 is primarily due to $27.3 million of tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 United States federal net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in prior years, that is partially offset by current year interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of $13.3 million, and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest related to prior year tax positions of $14.5 million. With the exception of the fiscal 2009 United States federal net operating loss that can be utilized in prior years, we recorded a valuation allowance that offset the tax benefit from other fiscal 2009 United States losses and tax credits. The $14.5 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest during fiscal 2009 included $7.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest that should have been recognized during multiple periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008. The effects on our fiscal 2009 results and our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods are not considered material. We had a fiscal 2008 provision for income taxes, primarily due to the significant fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill, the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings. During fiscal 2008, we recognized the impairment of $1,059.7 million of United States goodwill that was non-deductible. We also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by $326.0 million because of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization. In making this judgment, we considered the fiscal 2008 loss that resulted in a cumulative three-year loss and other factors. Finally, given the challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008, we decided that $317.2 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries would not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a result, we accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal, state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations. Our effective tax rate was negative for fiscal 2008, primarily due to the fiscal 2008 Loss before provision for income taxes and the fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill, the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings. We expect to have a provision for income taxes for fiscal 2011 primarily due to tax expense of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, we currently anticipate recording a valuation allowance that will offset the potential tax benefit of certain United States tax credit carryforwards generated during fiscal 2011. Our expectation excludes the impact of possible effective settlements of tax examinations that may occur during fiscal 2011. We also expect that our estimated annual effective tax rate to be particularly sensitive to any changes to our estimates of tax expense because we expect fiscal 2011 income to be near break-even. 49 Table of Contents We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $133.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 1, 2011, to meet the working capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $61.0 million as of January 1, 2011. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We concluded that a valuation allowance of $374.7 million was required as of January 1, 2011. This represents a decrease in valuation allowance of $8.4 million in comparison with the year ended January 2, 2010. If, in the future, we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received RARs indicating that the IRS has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies. For further discussion regarding our Income taxes, including the calculation of our valuation allowance, our deferred tax assets, and the status of the IRS examinations, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change January 1, January 2, January 3, 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2011 2010 2009 2009 2008 (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents and Short-term investments $ 570.1 $ 571.3 $ 572.1 $ (1.2 ) $ (0.8 ) Net working capital $ 181.9 $ 452.8 $ 389.8 $ (270.9 ) $ 63.0 Change 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 199.1 $ 25.6 $ 70.3 $ 173.5 $ (44.7 ) Cash used for investing activities $ (285.1 ) $ (50.5 ) $ (126.9 ) $ (234.6 ) $ 76.4 Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 59.9 $ 21.0 (443.4 ) $ 38.9 $ 464.4 Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments As of January 1, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $570.1 million of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments, as compared to $571.3 million as of January 2, 2010 and $572.1 million as of January 3, 2009. Approximately one-third of our cash and cash equivalents is held in accounts in the United States. Our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were: • Customer payments for software and IP licenses and from the sale or lease of our hardware products; • Customer payments for maintenance; • Customer payments for engineering services; • Proceeds from the issuance of our 2015 Notes; • Proceeds from the sale of our 2015 Warrants; • Proceeds from the sale of long-term investments; and • Cash received for common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. 50 Table of Contents Our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were: • Payments relating to salaries, benefits, other employee-related costs and other operating expenses, including our restructuring plans; • Payments to former shareholders of acquired businesses, net of cash acquired, including Denali; • Repurchase of a portion of our Convertible Senior Notes; • Payments made to purchase the 2015 Notes Hedges; • Purchases of treasury stock; and • Purchases of property, plant and equipment. We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. Net Working Capital Net working capital decreased $270.9 million as of January 1, 2011, as compared to January 2, 2010, and increased $63.0 million as of January 2, 2010, as compared to January 3, 2009, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2009 2008 (In millions) Convertible notes $ (143.3 ) $ ---- Current portion of deferred revenue (89.7 ) 55.4 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (66.7 ) 110.9 Cash and cash equivalents (11.7 ) 0.9 Receivables, net (8.7 ) (98.0 ) Short-term investments 10.5 (1.7 ) Inventories 14.9 (4.3 ) Prepaid expenses and other 23.7 (0.1 ) Other individually insignificant items 0.1 (0.1 ) $ (270.9 ) $ 63.0 Because our 2011 Notes mature on December 15, 2011, our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2011 includes a current liability of $143.3 million representing the $150.0 million principal amount of the 2011 Notes, net of the applicable discount. Discount amortization will continue during fiscal 2011 and the carrying value of the 2011 Notes will equal the $150.0 million principal amount at maturity. Prior to the maturity of the 2015 Notes, holders of the 2015 Notes have the right to surrender their notes for conversion into cash during any fiscal quarter, and only during such fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeds $9.81 for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. If the notes were to become convertible (even if holders do not convert their notes), the principal balance of the 2015 Notes, net of the associated discount would be reported as a current liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Reporting our 2015 Notes as a current liability could have a material adverse impact on our net working capital. In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with various financial institutions. These convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce our exposure under the 2015 Notes in the event of cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. For an additional description of our 2011 Notes and 2015 Notes, see “Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 51 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased $173.5 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased $44.7 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2009 2008 (In millions) Net income (loss), net of non-cash related gains and losses $ 161.3 $ 55.0 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effect of acquired businesses 18.0 (53.3 ) Proceeds from the sale of receivables, net (5.8 ) (46.4 ) $ 173.5 $ (44.7 ) Cash flows from operating activities include Net income (loss), adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements. During fiscal 2009 our customers, who are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor sector, experienced adverse changes in their business due to the challenging economic environment. While the semiconductor industry grew and overall economic conditions stabilized during fiscal 2010, our customers may experience adverse changes in the future that may cause them to delay purchasing our products and services or delay or default on their payment obligations. As of January 1, 2011, one customer accounted for 19% of our total Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables, net. As of January 2, 2010 one customer accounted for 15% of our Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables, net. As of January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, approximately half of our total Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables, net were attributable to ten of our customers. If our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. Our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. Though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations. We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financial institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis. During fiscal 2009, we transferred accounts receivable to financial institutions on a non-recourse basis, totaling $5.8 million, net of the losses on the sale of the receivables, as compared to $52.2 million during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2010, we did not transfer any of our accounts receivable to financial institutions. The change in our license mix has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and, therefore, a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions. For an additional description of our sales of receivables, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to pay $15.8 million in cash related to the settlement of our shareholder and derivative litigation, which is total settlement costs of $40.0 million, net of $24.2 million we expect will be paid by our insurance carriers. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of our legal proceedings and this settlement. During fiscal 2008 and 2009, we initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities. In February 2011, we announced additional restructuring activities that we initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities. We expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring plan-related annual operating expense savings related to the 2010 restructuring activities will be offset by increased spending in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies. 52 Table of Contents As of January 1, 2011, we have paid of $74.5 million in connection with the restructuring plans initiated in 2008 and 2009. We expect to pay an additional $11.1 million related to the 2008, 2009 and 2010 restructuring activities, of which $9.1 million is for termination benefits related to the 2010 restructuring activities. We expect substantially all termination benefits related to the 2010 Restructuring Plan to be paid by the end of fiscal 2011. We expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, the timing and amount of tax payments and our operating results. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our primary investing activities during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 consisted of: • Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired; • Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment; and • Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities and long-term investments. Net cash used for investing activities decreased $234.6 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased $76.4 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2009 2008 (In millions) Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired $ (242.0 ) $ 6.8 Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities (4.1 ) (52.4 ) Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment (3.0 ) 3.9 Purchases of available-for-sale securities ---- 62.4 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 6.5 56.0 Proceeds from the sale of long-term investments 10.3 (4.0 ) Other individually insignificant items (2.3 ) 3.7 $ (234.6 ) $ 76.4 During fiscal 2010, we acquired Denali for an aggregate initial purchase price of $296.8 million, which was paid in cash. For an additional description of our acquisition of Denali, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with our acquisitions completed before January 1, 2011, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $17.9 million during the next 27 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full, of which $10.2 million would be expensed in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of Mentor Graphics common stock for $62.4 million in connection with our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics we sold our entire equity interest in Mentor Graphics for $53.0 million. In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings. During the lease term, we constructed an additional building on our San Jose, California campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction. The decrease in cash payments for Property, plant and equipment during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, is primarily due to the completion of this new building in January 2009. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, purchasing software licenses, business combinations, and making long-term equity investments. 53 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities During fiscal 2010, we issued $350.0 million principal amount of the 2015 Notes. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges with various parties to reduce the potential cash outlay from the conversion of the 2015 Notes and to mitigate the negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. In separate transactions, we sold warrants, or the 2015 Warrants, to purchase our common stock at a price of $10.78 per share to various parties. We used an aggregate of $187.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 Notes to purchase in the open market $100.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes and $100.0 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes, and we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $40.0 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in a separate transaction, we repurchased in the open market $5.5 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $38.9 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2009 was $21.0 million, as compared to net cash used for financing activities of $443.4 million during fiscal 2008. The changes in our financing cash flows are due to the following: Change 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2009 2008 (In millions) Proceeds from issuance of 2015 Notes, net of initial purchaser’s fees $ 340.2 $ ---- Proceeds from sale of 2015 Warrants 37.5 ---- Principal payments of our 2023 Notes ---- 230.2 Proceeds from receivable sale financing ---- (18.0 ) Tax effect related to employee stock transactions allocated to equity (10.8 ) 1.0 Proceeds from the issuance of common stock (14.4 ) (20.2 ) Purchases of treasury stock (40.0 ) 274.0 Purchase of 2015 Notes Hedges (76.6 ) ---- Repurchase of Convertible Senior Notes (192.4 ) ---- Other individually insignificant items (4.6 ) (2.6 ) $ 38.9 $ 464.4 During fiscal 2010, we paid $9.7 million of taxes related to employee stock transactions. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this payment. The decrease in Proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, is primarily due to decreased purchase limits under our ESPP, which became effective during fiscal 2009. When treasury stock is reissued at a price higher than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of Capital in excess of par in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is reissued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of Capital in excess of par to the extent that there are treasury stock gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in Capital in excess of par, the losses upon reissuance of treasury stock are recorded as a component of Accumulated deficit in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded losses on the reissuance of treasury stock of $87.4 million during fiscal 2010, $213.4 million during fiscal 2009 and $110.6 million during fiscal 2008. As of January 1, 2011, we have $814.4 million remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The $150.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes is due on December 15, 2011. 54 Table of Contents Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources Income Taxes We provide for United States income taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. During fiscal 2010, we repatriated $63.4 million of previously taxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, resulting in cash tax payments of approximately $1.9 million. As of January 1, 2011, we had a deferred tax liability of $5.2 million related to $8.6 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which we have previously made a provision for income tax. We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $133.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 1, 2011, to meet the working capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $61.0 million as of January 1, 2011. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received RARs pursuant to which the IRS has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies. For an additional description of our IRS Examinations, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2010, we determined that uncertain tax positions that were subject to the IRS examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 were effectively settled. In prior fiscal periods, we made cash deposits of approximately $8.9 million to the IRS related to this settlement. During fiscal 2010, net of tax refunds we expect to receive, we made additional cash payments, of approximately $0.9 million to the IRS and to various state and local tax authorities to cover our remaining tax liabilities related to this settlement. During fiscal 2010, we released $66.7 million of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the acquisition accounting for Denali. This release of the valuation allowance is primarily related to deferred income tax liabilities for acquired intangible assets and does not impact our current or future cash position. As of January 1, 2011, we had current income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $5.8 million. As of January 1, 2011, we had long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $76.6 million. For an additional description of the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, see the discussion under the heading “Contractual Obligations.” 2.625% Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due 2015 In June 2010, we issued $350.0 million principal amount of our 2015 Notes to four initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges with various parties to reduce the potential cash outlay from the cash conversion of the 2015 Notes and to mitigate the negative effect such cash conversion may have on the price of our common stock. In separate transactions, we sold the 2015 Warrants to various parties. The 2015 Notes mature on June 1, 2015, and will be paid in cash at maturity. As of January 1, 2011, none of the conditions allowing the holders of the 2015 Notes to convert had been met; however, the price of our common stock has recently been near or greater than the stock price necessary to allow holders of the 2015 Notes to convert. If this stock price condition is met in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Notes, then upon any conversion of the 2015 Notes by holders we would be required to pay a settlement amount determined in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Notes. In that event, the 2015 Notes Hedges counterparties would generally be required to pay to us an amount equal to the cash conversion value of the 2015 Notes that have been converted to the extent that the cash conversion value exceeds the par amount of the converted 2015 Notes. For an additional description of the 2015 Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 15, 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 15, 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes and $250.0 million of our 2013 Notes to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale 55 Table of Contents to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act. Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into the Convertible Senior Notes Hedges with various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and to mitigate the negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. In separate transactions, we sold the Convertible Senior Notes Warrants to various parties. The 2011 Notes mature on December 15, 2011 and the 2013 Notes mature on December 15, 2013, and the principal amounts will be paid in cash at maturity. As of January 1, 2011, none of the conditions allowing the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met. Because the 2011 Notes mature on December 15, 2011, our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2011 includes a current liability of $143.3 million representing the $150.0 million principal amount of the 2011 Notes, net of the applicable discount. Discount amortization will continue during fiscal 2011 and the carrying value of the 2011 Notes will equal the $150.0 million principal amount at maturity. In connection with the issuance of the 2015 Notes, we used an aggregate of $187.2 million of the net proceeds to purchase in the open market $100.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes and $100.0 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes, resulting in a remaining principal balance of $150.0 million for the 2011 Notes and $150.0 million for the 2013 Notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in a separate transaction, we repurchased in the open market $5.5 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes, which resulted in a remaining principal balance for the 2013 Notes of $144.5 million. We also sold a portion of the Convertible Senior Notes Hedges and purchased a portion of the Convertible Senior Notes Warrants at the time of these repurchases. For an additional description of the Convertible Senior Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of January 1, 2011 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less More Total Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Than 5 Years (In millions) Operating lease obligations $ 81.3 $ 20.0 $ 28.4 $ 14.3 $ 18.6 Purchase obligations 44.5 40.7 3.8 ---- ---- 2023 Notes(1) 0.2 ---- 0.2 ---- ---- Convertible Senior Notes 294.5 150.0 144.5 ---- ---- 2015 Notes(4) 350.0 ---- ---- 350.0 ---- Contractual interest payments 49.9 13.4 22.7 13.8 ---- Current income tax payable and unrecognized tax benefits 9.7 9.7 ---- ---- ---- Other long-term contractual obligations (2)(3) 80.6 ---- 72.0 ---- 8.6 Total $ 910.7 $ 233.8 $ 271.6 $ 378.1 $ 27.2 (1) The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash the remaining portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount. Therefore, we have included $0.2 million of principal of the 2023 Notes on the potential repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the 1-3 Years column in the table above. (2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $76.6 million, and of that amount we estimate that $60.7 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years. We did not include the remaining long-term income tax liabilities of $15.9 million in the table above, because we estimated that this liability can be offset by available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and that future cash payments will not be required to settle this liability. However, the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing of such tax payments may 56 Table of Contents depend upon the resolution of current and future tax examinations that cannot be estimated with certainty. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisition-related liabilities. (3) As reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2011, Long-term liabilities includes $130.2 million related to the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative. This amount is not included in the table above because any future cash payments related to this liability would be offset by cash received from the 2015 Notes Hedges. For an additional description of the 2015 Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Prior to the maturity of the 2015 Notes, holders of the 2015 Notes have the right to surrender their notes for conversion into cash during any fiscal quarter, and only during such fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeds $9.81 for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. If the notes were to become convertible (even if holders do not convert their notes), the principal balance of the 2015 Notes, net of the associated discount, would be reported as a current liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with various financial institutions. These convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce our exposure under the 2015 Notes in the event of cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of January 1, 2011 or the earliest cancellation date. In connection with our acquisitions completed before January 1, 2011, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $17.9 million in cash during the next 27 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 1, 2011, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. New Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting standards for multiple-deliverable arrangements and for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements. The new standards for multiple-deliverable arrangements enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. These standards establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on: (a) vendor-specific objective evidence; (b) third-party evidence; or (c) estimates. These standards also eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. In addition, these standards significantly expand required disclosures related to a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. Under the new standards for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements, tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality are excluded from the pre-existing software revenue standards. In addition, hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are always excluded from the pre-existing software revenue standards. We have adopted these standards prospectively as of January 2, 2011, the first day of fiscal 2011, for multiple element arrangements involving our emulation hardware systems and for other nonsoftware related deliverables. The impact of these new standards will result in revenue being recognized for certain sales of hardware and nonsoftware deliverables that are separate from the software deliverables within a multiple element arrangement, which may result in the value of up-front revenue orders exceeding 10% of the total value of all orders in a single fiscal quarter. The nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend on the arrangements we enter into with multiple deliverables after the adoption date, but we do not expect the application of these new standards will impact our intended mix of orders for fiscal 2011, as outlined under the heading “Results of Operations — Revenue.” 57 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk Most of our revenue, expenses and material business activity are transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and in certain countries, in particular, Japan, where we invoice customers in the local currency, we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening United States dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets. Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures. The following table provides information, as of January 1, 2011, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts mature before or during March 2011. Weighted Average Notional Contract Principal Rate (In millions) Forward Contracts: Japanese yen $ 36.4 82.94 Indian rupee 14.4 45.58 Canadian dollar 10.9 1.01 Chinese renminbi 10.2 6.63 New Taiwan dollar 8.4 29.83 Hong Kong dollar 7.2 7.77 European Union euro 7.0 .74 Israeli shekel 6.2 3.60 Other 4.9 N/A Total $ 105.6 Estimated fair value $ 1.6 58 Table of Contents While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges. We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk, and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of January 1, 2011. The following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified as Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2011. Carrying Average Value Interest Rate (In millions) Interest-Bearing Instruments: Cash equivalents – variable rate $ 463.7 0.18% Cash – variable rate 25.6 0.20% Cash – fixed rate 42.5 0.55% Total interest-bearing instruments $ 531.8 0.21% Equity Price Risk 2.625% Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due 2015 In June 2010, we issued $350.0 million principal amount of our 2015 Notes. In a separate private placement transaction, we also sold warrants to various parties for the purchase of up to approximately 46.4 million shares of Cadence’s common stock at a price of $10.78 per share. These warrants expire on various dates from September 2015 through December 2015 and must be settled in net shares. For an additional description of our 2015 Notes, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 15, 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 15, 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes and $250.0 million of our 2013 Notes. For an additional description of our 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Investments 59 Table of Contents We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of these investments. 60 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:47:28.931942
813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the extent and timing of future revenues and expenses and customer demand, statements regarding the deployment of our products, statements regarding our reliance on third parties and other statements using words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “should,” “will” and “would,” and words of similar import and the negatives thereof, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are predictions based upon our current expectations about future events. Actual results could vary materially as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those expressed in these statements. We refer you to the “Risk Factors” “Competition,” “Proprietary Technology,” “Factors That May Affect Future Results,” “Results of Operations,” “Disclosures About Market Risk,” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections contained in this Annual Report and the risks discussed in our other SEC filings, which identify important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We urge you to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report are made only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update these forward-looking statements. Overview General We license electronic design automation, or EDA, software, sell or lease hardware technology and provide design and methodology services throughout the world to help accelerate and manage customers’ electronic product development processes. Our broad range of products and services are used by the world’s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex ICs and personal and commercial electronic systems. For a detailed discussion of the challenges and opportunities of the EDA industry and our products and services, see Item 1. Business above. As part of our strategy, we have acquired companies, businesses and third party intellectual property to acquire technology and key personnel, and we expect to continue making acquisitions in the future. After experiencing a downturn in demand and production in the last several years which resulted in reduced research and development spending by many of our customers, IC manufacturers and electronics companies appear to have experienced a gradual recovery in the second half of 2003, but have continued their focus on cost containment. In response to the downturn in the economy, and in the electronics industry in particular, we have initiated significant restructuring activities over the past several years to better align our cost structure with expected demand and revenues. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage Cadence’s business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items more fully in the “Results of Operations” below. In 2003, we experienced a continued customer preference for renewable license types and expect the timing of license renewals to continue to impact our results of operations. Product revenue recognized from backlog comprised approximately 60% of total product revenue in 2003, 45% in 2002 and 30% in 2001. This trend is primarily due to, and may continue as a result of, increasing customer preference for subscription licenses and customer requirements for more flexible payment terms. Restatement During 2003, we restated our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2002 as discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. While 27 Table of Contents certain adjustments impacting our Consolidated Financial Statements for periods prior to fiscal 2002 were also identified, the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2001 were not materially affected by the adjustments, and a firm that is no longer in existence audited the Consolidated Financial Statements for that year. Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to our fiscal 2001 Consolidated Financial Statements. However, for the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 28, 2002 to be properly stated, we have recorded the cumulative effect of adjustments for all years prior to fiscal 2002 of $11.9 million to opening retained earnings for fiscal 2002. The following discussion in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflects the effects of the Restatements. Acquisitions We have acquired companies, businesses and third party technology, some of which are described below, and we expect to acquire other companies, businesses and third party technology in the future. We undertake these acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy, and specifically, to acquire key personnel, technology and customer relationships of the acquired business. For each of these acquisitions the results of operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition. These acquisitions are described in more detail below in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Comparative pro forma financial information was not presented for the 2003 or 2002 acquisitions because these acquisitions were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements, either individually or in the aggregate. For additional information regarding our 2003 acquisitions, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”, “Results of Operations” and “General and Administrative” found below in this Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, and the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A summary of certain information regarding acquisitions completed by Cadence in fiscal 2003 and 2002, including the aggregate initial purchase price paid, is as follows: Date of Acquisition 2003 2002 Consideration (In millions) Verplex (A) August 2003 $ 87.6 $ — Cash Innotech distribution rights (B) June 2003 78.7 — Cash Get2Chip (C) April 2003 80.5 — Cash Celestry (D) January 2003 65.7 — Cash IBM TDA (E) September 2002 — 70.0 Cash Simplex (F) June 2002 — 329.7 Stock Other 2003 acquisitions Various 18.9 — Cash Other 2002 acquisitions Various — 61.6 Cash & Stock Total initial aggregate purchase price $ 331.4 $ 461.3 The businesses or assets acquired include: (A) Verification technology. (B) Distribution rights to certain customers, certain assets and key personnel of this Japan-based developer and distributor of software, electronic devices and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. (C) Nanometer-scale synthesis. (D) Silicon modeling products and full-chip circuit simulation. (E) Test design automation. (F) Design and verification. The purchase prices of our acquisitions generally consist of one or more of the following: cash payments, shares of our common stock, the fair value of assumed options, if any, and acquisition costs. Other than the 28 Table of Contents Simplex, Innotech and IBM’s TDA acquisitions, the purchase price and goodwill associated with companies acquired (but not asset acquisitions) will increase above the initial purchase price paid if certain performance goals related to revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development or employee retention, which are measured over periods of up to four years following the acquisitions, are achieved. Concurrent with the Innotech acquisition, we also modified our distributor agreement with Innotech. Prior to this acquisition, we licensed most of our software products in Japan through Innotech, of which we were, and continue to be, a 15% stockholder. We now directly license our software products to certain customers for which we acquired the distribution rights from Innotech. For most of our acquisitions of private companies, a portion of the purchase price is payable after the acquired business group’s achievement of certain performance goals, which generally relate to one or more of bookings, revenue, product development, product proliferation or employee retention. The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition. In connection with some acquisitions, Cadence may grant stock options with either time-based or performance-based vesting, or a combination of both, to employees of the acquired business as performance incentives. As a result, the amount of cash consideration or shares of our common stock issued to former stockholders of the acquired entity will increase as performance goals are achieved, generally over a period of up to four years following the completion of the respective acquisition. Accordingly, goodwill and deferred stock compensation expense will increase upon the attainment of such goals. During 2003, we paid $2.4 million in cash and recorded an additional 3.7 million shares valued at $57.7 million related to acquisition earnouts. We recorded $52.3 million in additional goodwill consisting of $2.4 million in cash and $49.9 million representing 3.2 million shares. We also recorded additional deferred stock compensation of $7.8 million representing 0.4 million shares for earnouts achieved during 2003. In addition, we recorded $0.5 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated future earnouts in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.” The additional goodwill and deferred stock compensation related to the achievement of certain performance goals associated with one or more of the following criteria: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. During 2002, we recorded an additional 12.8 million shares, valued at $204.7 million. We recorded $181.2 million of the $204.7 million as additional goodwill representing 11.3 million of the 12.8 million shares. We also recorded deferred stock compensation of $23.5 million of the $204.7 million, representing 1.5 million of the 12.8 million shares for earnouts achieved during 2002. In addition, we recorded $4.6 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated future earnouts in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.” The additional goodwill and deferred stock compensation related to the achievement of certain performance goals associated with one or more of the following criteria: bookings, product proliferation, product development and/or employee retention resulting from acquisitions. In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to January 3, 2004, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $39.1 million in cash and issue a total of 0.8 million shares of our common stock during fiscal 2004. In addition, we may be required to pay an additional $76.0 million in cash from 2005 through 2007 if certain performance goals related to bookings, revenues, product development, product proliferation or employee retention are achieved in full. The goodwill recorded in connection with the above-described contingent earnouts for acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Legal Settlements In September 2003, we entered into a settlement with Mentor Graphics Corporation, pursuant to which Cadence, Mentor and their respective affiliated parties settled all outstanding litigation between the companies and such affiliated parties relating to emulation and acceleration systems. The companies also agreed that, for a period of seven years, neither will sue the other over patented emulation and acceleration technology. 29 Table of Contents Mentor also paid us $18.0 million in cash as part of the settlement. Net of related legal costs, we recorded $14.5 million during the year ended January 3, 2004 for the settlement. In November 2002, we announced the settlement of civil litigation filed against Avant! seeking damages related to theft of our intellectual property, including software code, as well as other trade secrets. The settlement with Avant!, its parent corporation Synopsys, Inc. and several individuals included an agreement to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims in the litigation and required the payment to us of $265.0 million, which was received in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002. In July 2001, Avant! was ordered to pay us $195.4 million in criminal restitution after Avant! entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the Superior Court of the State of California of conspiracy to take and use our trade secrets. This conspiracy included the theft by Avant! and certain individuals of our intellectual property, including software code, as well as other trade secrets. As of December 29, 2001, approximately $196.0 million, consisting of all of the restitution award plus interest was received. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our critical accounting estimates are as follows: • revenue recognition; • accounting for income taxes; • valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; and • restructuring charges. Revenue recognition We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by Statement of Position 98-9 “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,” to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental. We also apply the provisions of SFAS, No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists. Fee is fixed or determinable — We assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. We generally use installment contracts for term and subscription licenses and we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments, products or services. Our installment contracts generally have payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses, the payments are generally collected quarterly, and periodic payments are generally made in equal or nearly equal installments. Significant judgment is involved in this determination, including determining whether a contract amendment constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we no longer had a history of 30 Table of Contents collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. These changes would have a material impact on our results of operations. Collection is probable — We assess collectibility at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the customer’s past payment history and its current creditworthiness. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate that collection is probable. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement with installment payment terms, revenue from this license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment. These changes could have a material impact on our results of operations. Vendor-Specific Objective Evidence — Our VSOE for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing for comparable transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in the arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate VSOE. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we could no longer support VSOE for undelivered elements of multiple element arrangements, revenue would be deferred until we have VSOE for the undelivered elements or all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. This change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Services revenue — Services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing methodology and design services. Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees on a monthly basis, we estimate the percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. This change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Accounting for income taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes on our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from potential sources including tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus materially impacting our results of operations and financial position. Management must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into 31 Table of Contents account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. See the risk factor affecting future results titled “We have received an examination report from the Internal Revenue Service proposing a tax deficiency in certain of our tax returns, and the outcome of the examination or any future examinations involving similar claims may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.” Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, including goodwill At least annually we review for impairment of goodwill resulting from business combinations in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” We completed our annual impairment review during the third quarter of 2003. We did not identify any impairment to our goodwill as a result of this review. We review long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired intangibles, we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset, excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment is required in: • identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances; • forecasting future operating results; and • estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long-lived or intangible assets. Material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made. Restructuring charges We account for restructuring charges in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100 “Restructuring and Impairment Charges.” Since 2001 we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives. All restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal year 2003 were accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” and EITF No. 88-10 “Costs Associated with Lease Modifications or Terminations.” For restructuring activities initiated after fiscal year 2002, we accounted for the facilities and asset-related portions of this restructuring in accordance with SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The severance and benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112 “Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43.” These restructuring initiatives have required us to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly the timing of subleases and sublease terms. Closure and space reduction costs included in our restructuring charges include payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout costs and costs to maintain facilities during the period after abandonment. In addition, we have recorded estimated provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset write-downs, and other restructuring costs. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our restructuring accrual, and adjust the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions. We may incur future charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations We primarily generate revenue from licensing EDA software and selling or leasing hardware technology, providing maintenance for the software and hardware and providing design and methodology services. We principally utilize three license types which provide a customer flexibility with several alternatives to the rights it has to utilize our products, including (i) the right to access to new technology; (ii) the duration of the license — for a fixed term, generally two to three years, or on a perpetual basis; and (iii) payment terms. Customer decisions for these aspects of license transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed term of use, then this will result in either a subscription or term license. A business implication of that decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide if it wants to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups, rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with Cadence at expiration of the license. See Critical Accounting Estimates for additional discussion of licenses types and timing of revenue recognition. To the extent the customer obtains rights to remix to new technology or more flexible payment terms, the revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement. This distinction is critical. For example, a $3.0 million 3-year subscription would result in $1.0 million of revenue per year, or $250,000 per quarter. Whereas, a $3.0 million, 3-year term license, assuming equal or near equal payments and exclusive of the maintenance element, would result in $3.0 million of product revenue upon delivery, which is generally in the first quarter of the arrangement and no product revenue in succeeding quarters. An increasing proportion of our product business consists of subscription licenses, which give customers limited access to new technology, and licenses with more flexible payment terms. These changes have the effect of deferring the timing of revenue recognition to future periods. The result has been a decline in product revenue in 2003 compared to 2002, and 2002 compared to 2001, as the proportion of product licenses under which revenue is deferred continued to increase. With each succeeding quarter in which the amount of product licenses where revenue is deferred increases, our revenue from backlog also increases. Product revenue recognized from backlog comprised approximately 60% of total product revenue in 2003, 45% in 2002 and 30% in 2001. As long as customers continue to prefer subscription licenses, we expect that revenue from backlog will increase and our revenue will be less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in volume. Because of our model under which we recognize revenue over multiple periods, we do not believe that pricing volatility is a material component of the change in our product revenues from period to period and we do not analyze changes in pricing from one period to the next. The amount of product revenue in future periods will depend, among other things, on the terms and timing of our contract renewals or additional product sales with existing customers, the size of such transactions or renewals, and sales to new customers. Product revenue in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers prefer subscription, term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms. Revenue is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and changes in license types (e.g., subscription to term) for existing customers. Contract renewals, and consequently product revenues, are also affected by the competitiveness of our products. 33 Table of Contents Revenue % Change Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 (In millions) Product $ 663.5 $ 806.7 $ 830.5 (18 )% (3 )% Services 131.2 149.8 263.3 (12 )% (43 )% Maintenance 324.8 331.4 336.6 (2 )% (2 )% Total revenue $ 1,119.5 $ 1,287.9 $ 1,430.4 (13 )% (10 )% Revenue Mix by Product Group We analyze our business by product groups, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. We introduced our first platform in September 2002. The data for product groups before the introduction of a corresponding platform aggregates the revenues for the individual products associated with a platform. On this basis, the following table shows the percentage of product and maintenance revenue contributed by each of the five product groups, and services, for 2003, 2002 and 2001. 2003 2002 2001 Functional Verification 19% 19% 20% Digital IC Design 23% 22% 18% Custom IC Design 27% 26% 25% Design for Manufacturing 10% 10% 9% System Interconnect 9% 11% 10% Services 12% 12% 18% Total 100% 100% 100% In 2003 and, to a lesser extent, 2002, revenue for all platforms was negatively affected by the shift to more ratable licenses and lower sales volume. The following discussion analyzes revenue by product group from 2001 to 2003. Functional Verification: Our Incisive Functional Verification Platform, introduced in February 2003, supports a unified methodology, from design of the total system to design-in of particular ICs to design of specific systems, for all design domains. The revenue contribution for this platform remained constant on a relative basis in 2003. Increased revenue from our new Incisive simulators, our Conformal product, and strong demand for our new Palladium hardware in-circuit emulation option was offset by a decline in revenue from our older simulators and legacy emulation products. The relative revenue contribution declined from 2001 to 2002 as customers tended to forego purchases of verification products during the semiconductor downturn in favor of more critical products in the digital IC area. Digital IC Design: Our Encounter Digital IC Design Platform, introduced in September 2002, leverages a unified architecture for full digital implementation of nanometer-scale designs. The revenue contribution from this area increased on a relative basis from 2002 to 2003 due to increasing revenue for newer products in the Encounter platform which are focused on nanometer scale designs offset by declining sales of our older digital design products which were less competitive. The relative revenue contribution also increased from 2001 to 2002, driven by demand for new technology to meet the design needs of smaller semiconductor process geometries, and revenue from new products, primarily First Encounter. Custom IC Design: The Virtuoso Custom IC Design Platform, introduced in September 2003, enables development of silicon-accurate analog, custom digital, radio frequency and mixed-signal designs. The percentage of revenue from the Virtuoso platform increased from 2002 to 2003 due to incremental revenue from new products as well as the growing importance of mixed-signal chip designs, a factor which also contributed to the increase from 2001 to 2002. 34 Table of Contents Design for Manufacturing: Our products in the design for manufacturing area include Fire & Ice QX, SignalStorm, VoltageStorm, ElectronStorm and our Assura design rule checking products. The percentage of revenue from this area remained relatively constant from 2001 to 2003, as increasing revenue from newer products such as Fire & Ice QX and our Assura group was offset by declining revenue from our older products which are less competitive for the newer semiconductor processes. System Interconnect: Our Allegro System Interconnect Design Platform, introduced in March 2004, enables collaborative design of high-performance interconnect across the domains of IC, package and PCB, reducing cost and time to market. Our system interconnect products have underperformed our integrated circuit design products over the 2001 to 2003 period because this product group is more exposed to systems companies in the data communications and computer systems sectors, which suffered relatively larger declines in business than other sectors in the electronics industry downturn, and because there has been less technological change in the design of printed circuit boards and system interconnect, there has been less demand for new design products. Services revenue decreased $18.6 million in 2003 compared to 2002, and decreased $113.5 million in 2002 compared to 2001, due to a decrease in customer spending for design service as a result of the economic downturn experienced in the electronics industry. Additional financial information about segments can be found in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue by Geography % Change Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 (In millions) Domestic $ 623.7 $ 710.0 $ 785.4 (12)% (10)% International 495.8 577.9 645.0 (14)% (10)% Total revenue $ 1,119.5 $ 1,287.9 $ 1,430.4 (13)% (10)% Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 Domestic 56% 55% 55% International 44% 45% 45% International revenue decreased $82.1 million in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to a $59.3 million decrease in product revenue in Europe and a $13.4 million decrease in services revenue in Europe. The decrease in product revenue in Europe was primarily due to the timing of license renewals for existing customers. International revenue decreased $67.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, due a $34.0 million decrease in international services revenue and a $47.5 million decrease in product revenue in Europe, slightly offset by a $14.8 million increase in product revenue in Japan. Revenue in Japan accounted for 33% of total international revenue in 2002 compared to 28% in 2001. The slight increase in product revenue in Japan was due to the timing of license renewals for existing customers and was partially offset by a decrease in services revenue. The rate of revenue change varies geographically due to differences in the timing and extent of term license renewals for existing customers in those regions. In addition, both our domestic and international businesses have been affected by the revenue trends discussed above in this section entitled “Results of Operations.” 35 Table of Contents With respect to foreign currency exchange rates, revenue increased by $18.8 million in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily due to strengthening of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar. Revenue decreased by $8.4 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar. Additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of Revenue % Change Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 (In millions) Product $ 67.0 $ 98.3 $ 118.5 (32 )% (17 )% Services $ 93.2 $ 114.7 $ 192.6 (19 )% (40 )% Maintenance $ 56.5 $ 65.1 $ 65.3 (13 )% 0 % Cost of Revenue as a Percent of Related Revenue Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 Product 10% 12% 14% Services 71% 77% 73% Maintenance 17% 20% 19% Cost of product revenue includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of product revenue primarily includes the cost of employee salary and benefits, amortization of intangible assets directly related to Cadence products, documentation and royalties payable to third party vendors. Cost of product revenue associated with our Cadence Verification Acceleration, or CVA, hardware products also includes materials, assembly labor and overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software product. A summary of Cost of product is as follows: Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Product related costs $ 28.0 $ 63.8 $ 79.3 Amortization of acquired intangibles 39.0 25.2 20.3 Inventory write-off — 9.3 18.9 Total Cost of product $ 67.0 $ 98.3 $ 118.5 Cost of product revenue decreased $31.3 million in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to an $18.9 million reduction in amortized software costs, an $8.3 million decrease in royalties, a $9.3 million decrease in Inventory write-offs, and a $2.2 million decrease in acquisition-related write-offs. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles of $13.8 million during 2003. Cost of product revenue decreased $20.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001, due to a decrease in salary and benefits costs of $10.6 million, a decrease of $9.6 million in the amount of inventory write-offs and a $6.0 million decrease in cost of sales of CVA products, partially offset by a $6.4 million increase in royalty costs. During 2003, we began reporting amortization expense related to certain intangible assets acquired in business combinations in Cost of product. We previously recorded all amortization expense related to these intangibles in Amortization of acquired intangibles. Accordingly, we have reclassified amortization expense related to these intangibles of $25.2 million in 2002 and $20.3 million in 2001. 36 Table of Contents In 2002, we recognized a charge of $9.3 million, which is included in cost of product revenue, for excess inventory from decreased sales forecasts. In 2001, we recorded an $18.9 million write-off for excess inventory in cost of product revenue. Of the $18.9 million, $15.2 million of the write-off was related to excess inventory from decreased sales forecasts and $3.7 million related to two product lines that were discontinued as part of our restructuring. The excess inventory charges of $9.3 million in 2002 and $15.2 million in 2001 were due to significant decreases in forecasted revenue for emulation products and were calculated in accordance with our practice, which is based on reserving for inventory in excess of estimated 12-month demand. Inventory purchases and commitments are based on future sales forecasts. We typically buy and build inventory levels for certain key components to mitigate component supply constraints. Based on our current 12-month demand forecast, we do not anticipate that the excess inventory will be used at a later date. We have determined that inventory levels at January 3, 2004 were within forecasted usage for the succeeding 12-month period. Cost of services revenue primarily includes employee salary and benefits, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services revenue decreased $21.5 million in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from our reduction of services professionals in connection with our restructuring actions initiated in 2002 and 2003. Cost of services revenue decreased $77.9 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from our reduction of services professionals in connection with our restructuring actions initiated in 2001 and 2002. Cost of maintenance revenue includes the cost of customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support, production employees and documentation of maintenance updates. Cost of maintenance revenue decreased $8.6 million in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to a decrease in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from a decrease in employee headcount. Cost of maintenance revenue decreased $0.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a decrease in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from a decrease in employee headcount. Operating Expenses % Change Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 (In millions) Marketing and sales $ 326.6 $ 402.1 $ 393.6 (19 )% 2 % Research and development $ 340.1 $ 326.4 $ 297.3 4 % 10 % General and administrative $ 82.6 $ 115.8 $ 119.4 (29 )% (3 )% Total operating expenses $ 749.3 $ 844.3 $ 810.3 (11 )% 4 % Operating Expenses as a Percent of Total Revenue Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 Marketing and sales 29% 31% 28% Research and development 30% 25% 21% General and administrative 7% 9% 8% Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses decreased $75.5 million during 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to a $27.8 million decrease in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from our restructuring activities, a $16.1 million decrease in commission costs, a $12.6 million decrease in outside services, and a $4.1 million decrease in marketing program costs. Salary, benefits and commission costs declined due to reduced headcount in the sales and marketing organizations. Outside services costs declined due to decreased 37 Table of Contents commission payments to Innotech as a result of our acquisition of distribution rights to certain customers from Innotech, and due to a reduction in costs incurred for outside contractors and consultants. Marketing and sales expenses increased $8.5 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a $22.6 million increase in employee salary and benefit costs primarily related to acquisitions of other businesses and an $8.0 million increase in commission costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $20.3 million in sales program costs and $3.1 million in marketing program costs. Research and Development The increase in Research and development expense of $13.7 million for 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to a $14.1 million increase in salary, benefits and associated costs resulting from an increase in employees due to business acquisitions and an $18.9 million reduction in capitalized development costs, partially offset by an $11.5 million reduction in costs related to outsourced services and research and development projects as a result of the restructuring activities, and a $5.6 million decrease in expenses related to other outside services. The increase in Research and development expense of $29.1 million for 2002 compared to 2001, was primarily due to a $23.3 million increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employees, primarily due to business acquisitions. General and Administrative General and administrative expense decreased $33.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to a $16.6 million decrease in legal expense, a $9.3 million decrease in salary and benefit costs in connection with our restructuring activities and a $2.2 million decrease in bad debt expense. Bad debt expense continues to decline as collection experience in our services business continues to improve. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total receivables declined in 2003 as compared to 2002 because write-offs continued to decline and because of additional reductions in the percentage of receivables past due. There were no significant changes in our collection policies or payment terms from 2002 to 2003. General and administrative expense decreased $3.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to an increase of $11.1 million in legal expense, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in employee salary and benefits and an $8.0 million decrease in bad debt expense, primarily related to the design services business. The design services business was particularly affected by the economic downturn during 2001 and 2002 because some customers in financial distress failed to meet their payment obligations under their services contracts with us, often because they failed to obtain expected additional rounds of financing. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total receivables declined in 2002 compared to 2001 because of the write-offs in 2002 of specific reserves recorded in 2001 and because of a reduction in the percentage of receivables past due. There were no significant changes in our collection policies or payment terms from 2001 to 2002. Foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by $11.3 million in 2003, compared to 2002, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by $1.2 million in 2002, compared to 2001, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar. Operating Expenses Operating expenses declined $95.0 million from 2002 to 2003 as a result of the cost reductions from our 2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described more fully below in “Restructuring and Other Charges” and continued cost containment by our customers. We expect our operating expenses to be flat to up slightly in 2004 as we continue to realize cost reductions from our 2003 restructuring, offset by increased expenses from research and development and selected sales and marketing programs. 38 Table of Contents Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 62.6 $ 53.8 $ 70.8 Amortization of acquired intangibles increased $8.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to a $10.8 million increase in amortization of intangibles acquired from Simplex, IBM’s TDA, Celestry, Get2Chip, Verplex and Innotech. Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $17.0 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a $24.9 decrease attributable to the effects of implementing SFAS, No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized. This reduction was partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in amortization of intangibles acquired from Simplex and a $2.7 million increase in amortization of intangibles acquired from Silicon Perspective Corporation, or SPC. Amortization of Deferred Stock Compensation Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Amortization of deferred stock compensation $ 41.1 $ 44.0 $ 17.9 We amortize deferred stock compensation related to fixed awards to expense using the straight-line method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock vest. We recognize stock compensation expense related to variable awards using an accelerated method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock are earned. Amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased $2.9 million in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to a $14.8 million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to SPC and Tality (the former name of our design services business). This decrease was partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to Verplex, and a $2.2 million increase in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the mark-to-market of options granted to consultants. Amortization of deferred stock compensation increased $26.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to a $28.5 million increase in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to SPC. This increase was partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to Tality. Restructuring and Other Charges We initiated separate plans of restructuring in each of the past three years, in an effort to improve our revenue per employee, reduce operating expenses and improve operating margins and cash flows. The first of these plans of restructuring, which was announced in 2001, or the 2001 Restructuring, was intended to reduce costs by eliminating excess personnel and consolidating facilities and resources. The restructuring was in response to the severe economic downturn in the electronics industry. The restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing excess personnel and capacity costs within our design services business (formerly Tality) throughout the world, to align the cost structure of our design services business with its expected revenues. The 2001 restructuring was substantially completed within 12 months after commitment to the plan, except for remaining facilities-related charges from vacated facilities included in the plan. During 2002, we commenced a new plan of restructuring, or the 2002 Restructuring, intended to further reduce costs by eliminating excess personnel and consolidating facilities and resources due to the continued economic downturn in the electronics industry. The 2002 Restructuring costs resulted from involuntary terminations and the abandonment of long-lived assets and vacated facilities. These costs primarily related to our design services business and certain other business/infrastructure groups. 39 Table of Contents In July 2003, we announced an additional plan of restructuring, or the 2003 Restructuring, intended to reduce costs and realize efficiencies by eliminating excess personnel and consolidating facilities and resources throughout the company to align our cost structure with expected revenues. A summary of restructuring and other charges by plan of restructuring for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows: Severance and Asset- Excess Other Benefits Related Facilities Restructuring Total (In millions) 2003: 2003 Plan $ 25.7 $ 25.7 $ 10.9 $ — $ 62.3 2002 Plan 0.8 0.4 1.5 — 2.7 2001 Plan — — 1.8 — 1.8 Total 2003 26.5 26.1 14.2 — 66.8 2002: 2002 Plan 52.1 34.2 32.4 1.1 119.8 2001 Plan — — 14.5 — 14.5 Total 2002 52.1 34.2 46.9 1.1 134.3 2001: 2001 Plan 21.6 16.6 21.9 1.5 61.6 Total 2001 $ 21.6 $ 16.6 $ 21.9 $ 1.5 $ 61.6 Frequently, asset write-downs are based on significant estimates and assumptions, particularly regarding remaining useful life and utilization rates. We may incur other charges in the future if management determines that the useful life or utilization of certain long-lived assets has been reduced. Closure and space reduction costs included payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs, and costs to maintain facilities during the period after abandonment. To determine the lease loss, which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building, certain assumptions were made related to the: (1) time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant, (2) sublease terms, and (3) sublease rates, including common area charges. As of January 3, 2004, we have accrued the low end of the lease loss range related to all worldwide restructuring activities initiated since 2001, which is estimated to be $23.2 million. This amount will be adjusted in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. As of January 3, 2004, we have estimated that the high end of the lease loss range could be as much as $47.8 million if sublease rental rates decrease in applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities. Since 2001, we have recorded facilities consolidation charges under the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Restructurings of $83.0 million related to reducing space or the closing of 32 sites, of which 22 have been vacated and ten have been downsized. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from our management estimates made during the formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring activities may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. The demands for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, are difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. The following is further discussion of each restructuring plan: 2003 Restructuring — The 2003 Restructuring will result in the termination of approximately 635 employees. Costs resulting from this restructuring included severance payments, severance-related benefits and 40 Table of Contents outplacement services. All terminations and termination benefits associated with this restructuring were communicated to the affected employees prior to January 3, 2004, with all termination benefits expected to be paid by January 1, 2005. We expect to incur an additional $4 million to $6 million of future costs in connection with the 2003 Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges, which will be expensed as incurred. We expect annualized cost reductions resulting from the 2003 Restructuring of approximately $62 million in employee salary and benefits costs, related to the reduction in workforce and approximately $4 million in facility costs related to facilities consolidated or closed, which amounts could vary based on changes in estimates. These workforce reductions occurred throughout the company. Of the $25.7 million of asset-related costs we incurred in conjunction with the 2003 Restructuring, $11.2 million was directly related to restructuring and $14.5 million was for other charges. The $11.2 million of asset-related restructuring charges primarily related to a fee owed to a third party due to a reduction in headcount, write-off of leasehold improvements for facilities, disposal of excess equipment and contract termination costs. The $14.5 million of other charges was primarily related to the write-downs of internally developed and purchased software. As a result of the restructuring efforts, we eliminated budgeted expenditures for certain internally developed software projects. As such, we determined that it was no longer probable that the computer software being developed for internal purposes would be completed and placed into service. During the year, we also determined that we would not integrate certain technology relating to purchased software, that had been previously capitalized, into any of our future products. Accordingly, we recognized a charge to reduce the value of the internally developed software and purchased software to zero. The $10.9 million of net facilities charges we incurred under the 2003 Restructuring primarily related to space reductions at six sites and closure of five sites, along with further consolidation of two previously downsized sites. We accrued facilities charges as part of the 2003 Restructuring at the time we ceased use of the vacated space. 2002 Restructuring — The 2002 Restructuring resulted in the termination of employment for approximately 1,370 employees. While such terminations were across various business functions, operating units and geographic regions, the communications-related areas within the design services business were the most affected. Costs resulting from the restructuring included severance benefits, notice pay and outplacement services. All terminations and termination benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to December 28, 2002. During 2003, we incurred an additional $0.8 million in severance and benefits related to terminations included in the 2002 Restructuring. As of January 3, 2004, $1.4 million of severance and benefits associated with the 2002 restructuring activities remain to be paid, which are expected to be paid by June 30, 2004. Asset-related and other restructuring charges of $35.3 million incurred during 2002 under the 2002 Restructuring were connected with the abandonment of leasehold improvements for facilities, impairments resulting from abandonment of other fixed assets, including software licenses and contract termination costs. During 2003, we incurred $0.4 million of additional asset-related charges under the 2002 Restructuring for contract termination costs. During 2003, we recorded $1.5 million of additional facilities charges under the 2002 Restructuring, primarily associated with changes to lease loss estimates related to sites included in the plan. Facilities consolidation charges of $32.4 million recorded during 2002 under the 2002 Restructuring were primarily connected with the further downsizing of four previously downsized sites and the downsizing and closing of 16 additional sites. 2001 Restructuring — Facilities-related charges recorded under the 2001 Restructuring were $1.8 million in 2003 and $14.5 million during 2002, primarily connected with changes in lease loss estimates, due to reductions in estimated sublease income caused by deterioration in local real estate markets where facilities included in the plan are located. 41 Table of Contents Write-off of Acquired in-Process Technology Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to expense any acquired in-process technology that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired in-process technology is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established. The values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process technology. Described below are the write-offs of acquired in-process technology charges in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

We recorded a charge of $25.8 million in 2001 related to the impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles associated with the acquisition of Diablo. This impairment was due to the decline in business conditions generally and the wireless communications industry in particular. Key factors in 42 Table of Contents determining this impairment were significant downsizing or reassignment of personnel directly related to these assets and abandonment of most of Diablo’s lines of business. The impairment was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with Diablo’s acquisition and the fair value of those assets. Other Income (loss), net Other income (loss), net, for each of 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows: Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Interest income $ 3.4 $ 4.6 $ 6.5 Gain (loss) on foreign exchange 2.3 (0.3 ) 0.5 Equity in loss from investments, net (10.9 ) (9.4 ) (1.2 ) Other (10.4 ) (8.7 ) (1.5 ) Total other income (loss), net $ (15.6 ) $ (13.8 ) $ 4.3 In 2003, the Other loss of $10.4 million is comprised of $4.8 million impairment on investments, $5.0 million loss on sales of accounts receivable and $0.6 million of Other loss, net. In 2002, the Other loss of $8.7 million is comprised of $14.1 million of impairment of investments, $15.1 million of loss on sales of accounts receivable, $24.9 million gain on sale of investments and $4.4 million of Other loss, net. In 2001, the Other loss of $1.5 million is comprised of $21.8 million of loss on sales of accounts receivable, $6.0 million of impairment of investments, $23.6 million gain on sale of investments and $2.7 million of Other income, net. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: Restated Restated 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in millions) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (13.0 ) $ 83.7 $ 100.9 Effective tax rate 42.5 % 58.1 % 41.7 % The loss before provision for income taxes resulted in a benefit for income taxes in 2003 compared to a provision for income taxes in 2002. The 2003 benefit has a greater detriment from non-deductible amortization of stock compensation expense partially offset by a greater benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower rate than the federal statutory rate in comparison to 2002. The effective tax rate increased in 2002 from 2001, primarily due to the 2002 restructuring activities that resulted in foreign income being taxed at a higher rate than the federal statutory rate and an increase in non-deductible amortization of stock compensation expense. We expect to have a provision for income taxes in 2004 and expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. The 2004 provision is expected to have a smaller detriment from certain non-deductible expenses including the amortization of stock compensation and the write-off of in-process technology when compared to 2003. We also estimate that the 2004 provision will have a larger benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower rate than the federal statutory rate when compared to 2003. As of January 3, 2004, we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately $89.5 million. Realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however, could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts, including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from those estimated. 43 Table of Contents The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. The IRS recently completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended 1997 through 1999 and has issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, referred to as the RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $143 million, plus interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates have been between four and nine percent since 1997, and adjusts quarterly. The IRS may also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999 in future examinations. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have protested certain of the proposed adjustments with the IRS. The most significant of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws, and that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. We intend to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously. However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues. In addition, we cannot assure you that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination, we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the period or periods resolved. Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and costs associated with foreign currency hedges. We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of our policy, our priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. On August 15, 2003, we terminated our two syndicated, senior unsecured credit facilities that allowed us to borrow up to $375.0 million. 44 Table of Contents The table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with original maturities between three and 12 months are considered to be short-term investments. Investments with original maturities greater than 12 months are considered long-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value at January 3, 2004. Carrying Average Value Interest Rate (In millions) Interest Bearing Instruments: Cash equivalents — variable rate $ 128.8 1.43 % Commercial paper — fixed rate 103.9 1.14 % Cash — variable rate 89.9 0.52 % Total interest bearing instruments 322.6 1.08 % Total non-interest bearing cash 61.9 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 384.5 Foreign Currency Risk Our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening U.S. dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening U.S. dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying asset exposures decrease in value or underlying liability exposures increase in value. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying asset exposures increase in value or underlying liability exposures decrease in value. Forward contracts are not accounted for as hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other income (loss), net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities. We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates in effect as the forward contracts mature. 45 Table of Contents The table below provides information as of January 3, 2004 about Cadence’s forward foreign currency contracts. The information is provided in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar. These forward contracts mature prior to January 16, 2004. Weighted Average Notional Contract Principal Rate (In millions) Forward Contracts: Japanese yen $ 41.7 107.12 Euro 31.5 0.82 British pound sterling 26.7 0.58 Hong Kong dollars 9.2 7.76 Canadian dollars 9.0 1.31 Swedish krona 2.2 7.32 Singapore dollars 1.9 1.71 $ 122.2 Estimated fair value $ 0.3 While we actively and continually manage our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Equity Price Risk In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, to two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $408.5 million after transaction fees of approximately $11.5 million. The Notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will initially be convertible into 63.8790 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to maturity only if: (1) the price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during periods of time specified by the Notes, (2) specified corporate transactions occur, (3) the Notes have been called for redemption or (4) the trading price of the Notes falls below a certain threshold. In addition, in the event of a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for 100% of the principal amount. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with JP Morgan Chase Bank, whereby we have the option to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately $134.6 million. As of January 3, 2004, the estimated fair value of the convertible notes hedge transactions was $215.1 million. In addition, we sold to JP Morgan Chase Bank warrants to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants. As of January 3, 2004, the estimated fair value of the sold warrants was $116.2 million. 46 Table of Contents For additional discussion of the Notes see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 3, 2004, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $418.4 million of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments, compared to $395.6 million at December 28, 2002. The primary sources of our cash are receipts from software licenses and the sale or lease of our hardware, proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, proceeds from the sale of receivables and from the exercise of stock options and common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans. In 2003, our primary uses of cash consisted of payroll costs, costs of acquisitions, product and services, general and administrative expenses, cash used to hedge convertible notes to manage equity dilution and funds used in our share repurchase program. At January 3, 2004, we had net working capital of $360.3 million, as compared with $254.3 million at December 28, 2002. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $51.9 million, an increase in Receivables, net, of $34.7 million, and an increase in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments of $22.8 million, partially offset by an increase in Deferred revenue of $30.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $176.7 million, to $171.0 million, during 2003 when compared to $347.7 million net cash provided by operating activities during 2002. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to a reduction in income of $77.9 million, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $35.9 million and a $26.5 million reduction in write-off of acquired in-process technology. We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer qualifying accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a non-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During 2003, we transferred accounts receivable totaling $87.4 million, which approximated fair value, to financing institutions on a non-recourse basis, as compared to $182.0 million transferred during 2002. Provision for sales returns is accounted for as a reduction of revenue. Provision for sales returns increased $1.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to continued customer preference for more flexible subscription license arrangements. The sales return reserve as of year-end 2003 increased modestly in absolute dollars from year-end 2002, but remained at approximately 3% of net accounts receivable due to a slight increase in total receivables during 2002. Provision for sales returns decreased $24.0 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily in response to improved customer satisfaction with more flexible license arrangements, and to a lesser extent, an improving economic environment. The sales return reserve decreased $29.9 million in 2002 from 2001 due to write-offs of specific customer returns allowances recorded in 2001. Our primary investing activities consisted of business combinations and acquired intangibles, purchases of property, plant and equipment, purchases of software licenses and venture capital partnership and equity investments, which combined represented $338.4 million of cash used for investing activities in 2003, as compared to $175.4 million in 2002. As part of our overall investment strategy, we are a limited partner in two venture capital funds, Telos I and Telos II (referred to together as Telos). We and certain of our deferred compensation trusts are the sole limited partners of Telos I and we are the sole limited partner of Telos II. The partnership agreements governing Telos I and Telos II, which are substantially the same, require Cadence to meet capital calls principally for the purpose of funding investments that are recommended by the applicable Telos general partner, and approved by the Telos advisory committee as being consistent with the partnership’s limitations and stated purposes. The Telos general partner, which is not affiliated with Cadence, manages the partnerships and may be removed by Cadence without cause. For both partnerships, the advisory committee is comprised solely of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman of the Board of Directors. As of January 3, 2004, we had contributed $83.0 million to these partnerships and are contractually committed to contribute to them up to an additional $44.0 million. Our commitments expire concurrently with the termination date of each partnership, which, in the case of Telos I is December 31, 2005 and, in the case of Telos II, is July 3, 2012. 47 Table of Contents Our investments in the Telos partnerships are recorded in Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2003, we received $9.1 million in cash from the sale-leaseback of certain equipment. We will make aggregate payments under the resulting operating leases of $9.1 million over the three to five year life of the operating leases. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2003, of $149.2 million increased by $203.3 million from 2002. In 2003, our primary source of cash from financing activities was the issuance of $420.0 million of convertible notes and the sale of common stock warrants as discussed further below. The primary use of cash from financing activities was the repurchase of $213.8 million of treasury stock and the purchase of convertible notes hedges for $134.6 million. During 2003, we issued $86.6 million of stock upon exercise of employee options and stock purchase rights. We expect to continue our financing activity and use cash reserves to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program. We may also consider additional hedging transactions if opportunities become available. As compared to December 28, 2002, Other long-term liabilities increased $112.9 million to $327.3 million at January 3, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to indemnity holdbacks from purchase price payments relating to three recent business acquisitions and an increase in deferred payments relating to another recent acquisition. The primary components of Other long-term liabilities are $45.3 million of deferred compensation, $34.8 million of accrued restructuring charges and $247.2 million relating to indemnity holdbacks from acquisitions, deferred payments relating to acquisitions and deferred tax liabilities. We provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless these earnings are considered permanently invested outside of the United States. If some or all of these foreign earnings were to be distributed to any of our U.S. subsidiaries, we would be required to provide for additional U.S. income taxes. At January 3, 2004, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $450 million. At January 3, 2004, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $80 million. We recently received a revenue agent report (referred to as an RAR) from the IRS in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the tax years from 1997 to 1999 of approximately $143 million, plus interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have filed a protest with the IRS to certain of the proposed adjustments. We are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously. The IRS may also make similar claims for tax returns filed for years subsequent to 1999. While we are protesting certain of the proposed adjustments, we can not predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of the tax examination including the amount payable, or timing of such payments, which may materially impact our cash flows in the period or periods resolved. We expect to incur an additional $4 million to $6 million of future costs in connection with the 2003 Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges which will be expensed as incurred. We expect annualized cost reductions resulting from the 2003 Restructuring of approximately $62 million in employee salary and benefits costs, related to the reduction in workforce and approximately $4 million in facility costs related to facilities consolidated or closed, which amounts could vary based on changes in estimates. In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, or the Notes, to two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of approximately $408.5 million after transaction fees of approximately $11.5 million that have been recorded in Other long-term assets and are being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over five years, which is the duration of the first redemption period. We issued the Notes at par and the Notes bear no interest. The Notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of 48 Table of Contents specified events. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount. As a result, although the Notes mature in 2023, the holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes at an additional premium in 2008, which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not otherwise converted into our common stock. The Notes do not contain restrictive financial covenants. In addition, in the event of a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for 100% of the principal amount. Upon a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure, in certain circumstances, we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We have agreed to file a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the Notes and the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Notes with the SEC within 90 days from the initial issuance of the Notes. In the event we do not file a shelf registration statement with the SEC within such time or the shelf registration statement is not declared effective by the SEC within 180 days from the initial issuance of the Notes or, after effectiveness, we suspend its use beyond certain permitted periods, we are obligated to pay liquidated damages to the holders of the Notes. In November 2003, we filed with the SEC a resale registration statement with respect to the Notes. This registration statement was not declared effective by the SEC within the 180-day period, and has not been declared effective as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, on February 12, 2004, we began to incur liquidated damages at a penalty rate of approximately $2,900 per day for the first 90 days, accruing daily. After the first 90 days, the penalty rate doubles until it ceases to accrue upon the date the registration statement becomes effective or is no longer suspended from use. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the registration statement has not become effective. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately $134.6 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants. The costs incurred in connection with the convertible notes hedge transactions and the proceeds from the sale of the warrants are included as a net reduction in common stock and capital in excess of par in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 3, 2004, in accordance with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock.” Subsequent changes in the fair value of these convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified in equity. Prior to conversion, the Notes have no impact on the calculation of basic or dilutive earnings per share, or EPS, unless the price of our common stock reaches $22.69, or the contingent conversion price, during certain quarterly conversion periods until August 2018, and then at any time thereafter until maturity or earlier redemption or repurchase. For any quarterly conversion period through August 2018 or any time after August 2018 in which the price of our common stock reaches the contingent conversion price, we will use the “as if converted” method to calculate the effect on diluted EPS, which will have the effect of increasing the number of outstanding shares by 26.8 million. Because we entered into the Notes hedge transactions and the sale of the warrants, upon conversion of the Notes there is no impact on basic or dilutive EPS, except as described above under the “as if converted” method, unless the price of our common stock exceeds the warrant strike price of $23.08 per share. Up to $23.08 per share, in connection with any conversion, the operation of the Notes hedge transactions and sale of the warrants would effectively result in no impact on basic or dilutive EPS. In the event our common stock 49 Table of Contents exceeds $23.08 per share, for the first $1.00 the price exceeds $23.08, there would be dilution of approximately 1.1 million shares and the impact on the calculation of EPS will vary depending on when during the quarter the $23.08 per share price is reached. As this share price continues to increase, dilution would continue to occur but at a declining rate. If these transactions settle in our favor, we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party to the transactions. After our issuance of the Notes, we terminated our senior credit facilities. A summary of contractual obligations follows: Payments Due by Period Less Than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter (In millions) Capital lease obligations $ 0.5 $ 0.4 $ 0.1 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations 157.4 35.3 43.9 31.6 46.6 Purchase obligations 4.1 3.0 1.1 — — Convertible notes 420.0 — — 420.0 — Other long-term liabilities 292.6 — 144.8 131.2 16.6 Total $ 874.6 $ 38.7 $ 189.9 $ 582.8 $ 63.2 In addition to the summary of contractual obligations detailed above, in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to January 3, 2004, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $39.1 million during fiscal 2004. In addition, we may be required to pay an additional $76.0 million in cash from 2005 through 2007 if certain performance goals related to revenue, bookings, product development, product proliferation, and employee retention are achieved in full. We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Also, while we have no committed lines of credit, we believe our good credit and strong banking relationships will provide us with access to bank debt and opportunities to raise debt in the public markets if additional liquidity is needed. New Accounting Standards In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB No. 51.” FIN 46 requires companies to include in their consolidated financial statements the assets, liabilities and results of activities of variable interest entities if the company holds a majority of the variable interests. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 are effective for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 or for entities in which an interest is acquired after January 31, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation date for the consolidation requirements of FIN 46 as it relates to variable interest entities that existed before February 1, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46. The consolidation requirements of the revised FIN 46 will apply to variable interest entities that existed prior to February 1, 2003 in financial statements issued for periods ending after December 15, 2003. The revised FIN 46 also requires companies that expect to consolidate a variable interest entity they acquired before February 1, 2003 to disclose the entity’s nature, size, activities, and the company’s maximum exposure to loss in financial statements issued after December 31, 2003. We have determined the adoption of the required provisions of the revised FIN 46 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 requires companies to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify 50 Table of Contents a financial instrument that requires a transfer of assets and that meets the definition of liabilities in Concepts Statement 6 and other recognition criteria in SFAS No. 5, “Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises,” be reported as a liability. SFAS No. 150 also requires that certain obligations that could be settled by issuance of an entity’s equity but lack other characteristics of equity be reported as liabilities even though the obligation does not meet the definition of liabilities in Concepts Statement No. 6. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A.

813672,CDNS,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the extent and timing of future revenues and expenses and customer demand, statements regarding the deployment of our products, statements regarding our reliance on third parties and other statements using words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “should,” “will” and “would,” and words of similar import and the negatives thereof, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are predictions based upon our current expectations about future events. Actual results could vary materially as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those expressed in these statements. We refer you to the “Competition,” “Proprietary Technology,” “Factors That May Affect Future Results,” “Results of Operations,” “Disclosures About Market Risk,” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections contained in this Annual Report and the risks discussed in our other SEC filings, which identify important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We urge you to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. All subsequent written or spoken forward-looking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report are made only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update these forward-looking statements. Overview General We license EDA software, sell or lease EDA hardware technology and intellectual property and provide design and methodology services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronic product development processes. Our broad range of products and services are used by electronics companies to design and develop complex ICs, IC packages and PCBs and personal and commercial electronic systems. For a detailed discussion of the challenges and opportunities of the EDA industry and our products and services, see Item 1, “Business” above. As part of our strategy, we have acquired companies, businesses and third party intellectual property to obtain technology, key personnel and customer relationships, and we expect to continue making acquisitions in the future. From 2000 through 2002, IC manufacturers and electronics companies experienced a severe downturn in demand and production. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, or SIA, semiconductor manufacturers experienced a reduction in revenues of over 35% from late 2000 to 2002. This economic downturn resulted in reduced research and development spending by many of our customers. During 2003 and 2004, IC manufacturers and electronics companies experienced a recovery in revenues. According to the SIA, semiconductor industry revenues grew by approximately 18% in 2003 and 28% in 2004. However, despite this recovery, our customers continued to spend cautiously through 2004. We expect this cautious spending to continue at least through 2005, as IC manufacturers and electronics companies revenues are expected to remain flat in 2005 compared to 2004. In response to the general downturn in the economy, and in the electronics industry in particular, we have initiated significant restructuring activities over the past several years, including during 2004, to better align our cost structure with projected demand for our products and services and their resulting projected revenues. We have announced additional restructuring activities during 2005 and expect to announce further restructurings in the future. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items more fully in the “Results of Operations” below. 28 Table of Contents We continue to observe a customer preference for renewable license types, which are term and subscription, and expect the timing of license renewals to continue to impact our results of operations. Product revenue recognized from backlog comprised approximately 68% of total product revenue in 2004, 60% in 2003, and 45% in 2002. This trend is primarily due to increasing customer preference for subscription licenses and customer requirements for more flexible payment terms. Acquisitions We have acquired companies, businesses and third party technology, some of which are described below, and we expect to acquire other companies, businesses and third party technology in the future. We undertake these acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy, and specifically, to acquire key personnel, technology and customer relationships of the acquired business. For each of these acquisitions the results of operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition. These acquisitions are described in more detail below and in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Comparative pro forma financial information was not presented for the 2004 or 2003 acquisitions because these acquisitions were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements, either individually or in the aggregate. For additional information regarding our 2004 acquisitions, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Results of Operations” found below in this Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A summary of certain information regarding acquisitions, all of which were for cash, we completed in 2004 and 2003, including the aggregate initial purchase price paid, is as follows: Date of Acquisition 2004 2003 (In millions) Neolinear, Inc. (A) April 2004 $ 78.1 $ — Verplex Systems, Inc. (B) August 2003 — 87.6 Innotech Corporation distribution rights (C) June 2003 — 78.7 Get2Chip.com, Inc. (D) April 2003 — 80.5 Celestry Design Technologies, Inc. (E) January 2003 — 65.7 Other 2004 acquisition August 2004 9.2 — Other 2003 acquisitions Various — 18.9 Total initial aggregate purchase price $ 87.3 $ 331.4 The businesses or assets acquired include: (A) Rapid analog design technology. (B) Functional verification technology. (C) Distribution rights to certain customers, certain assets and key personnel of this Japan-based developer and distributor of software, electronic devices and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. (D) Nanometer-scale synthesis. (E) Silicon modeling products and full-chip circuit simulation. The purchase prices of our acquisitions generally consist of one or more of the following: cash payments, shares of our common stock, the fair value of assumed options, if any, and acquisition costs. In general, the purchase price and goodwill associated with business acquisitions will increase above the initial purchase price paid if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention, which are measured over periods of up to four years following the acquisitions, are achieved. 29 Table of Contents Concurrent with our acquisition of certain Innotech assets, we also modified our distributor agreement with Innotech. Prior to this acquisition, we licensed most of our software products in Japan through Innotech, of which we were an approximately 15% stockholder as of January 1, 2005. We now directly license our software products to the customers for which we acquired the distribution rights from Innotech. For almost all of our acquisitions of private companies, a portion of the purchase price is payable after the acquired business group’s achievement of certain performance goals, which generally relate to one or more of the following: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition. In connection with some acquisitions, we may grant equity awards with either time-based or performance-based vesting, or a combination of both, to employees of the acquired business as performance incentives. As a result, the amount of cash consideration or shares of our common stock issued to former stockholders of the acquired entity will increase as performance goals are achieved, generally over a period of up to four years following the completion of the respective acquisition. Accordingly, goodwill and stock compensation expense will increase upon the attainment of such goals. During 2004, we recorded $40.6 million of goodwill as contingent purchase price payable to stockholders of acquired companies. The $40.6 million of goodwill consisted of $17.0 million of actual cash payments, $7.2 million of accrued cash payments and the issuance of 1.1 million shares of our common stock valued at $16.4 million. In addition, we recognized stock compensation expense of $1.2 million in connection with these acquisitions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB No. 25).” The additional goodwill and stock compensation expense was related to the achievement of certain performance goals associated with one or more of the following criteria: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. The portion of the earnout associated with employee retention is recorded as compensation expense. During 2003, we paid $2.4 million in cash and issued or reserved for issuance an additional 3.7 million shares of our common stock valued at $57.7 million related to acquisition earnouts. We recorded $52.3 million in additional goodwill consisting of $2.4 million in cash and $49.9 million representing the issuance or reserve for issuance of 3.2 million shares. We also recorded additional stock compensation expense of $7.8 million representing the issuance or reserve for issuance of 0.4 million shares for earnouts achieved during 2003. In addition, we recorded $0.5 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated future earnouts in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.” The additional goodwill and stock compensation expense related to the achievement of certain performance goals associated with one or more of the following criteria: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. The portion of the earnout associated with employee retention is recorded as compensation expense. In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $47.0 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional $36.0 million in cash during the three years following the next 12 months if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following criteria are achieved in full: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. The goodwill recorded in connection with the above-described contingent earnouts for acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Legal Settlements In September 2003, we entered into a settlement with Mentor Graphics Corporation, pursuant to which Cadence, Mentor and their respective affiliated parties settled all outstanding litigation between the companies and such affiliated parties relating to emulation and acceleration systems. The companies also agreed that, for a period of seven years, neither will sue the other over patented emulation and acceleration technology. Mentor also paid us $18.0 million in cash as part of the settlement. Net of related legal costs, we recorded a gain of $14.5 million during the year ended January 3, 2004 for the settlement. 30 Table of Contents In November 2002, we announced the settlement of civil litigation filed against Avant! Corporation seeking damages related to theft of our intellectual property, including software code, as well as other trade secrets. The settlement with Avant!, its parent corporation Synopsys, Inc. and several individuals included an agreement to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims in the litigation and required the payment to us of $265.0 million, which amount was received in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002. Net of related legal costs, we recorded a gain of $261.1 million during the year ended December 28, 2002 for the settlement. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill and restructuring charges have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue recognition We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by Statement of Position 98-9 “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,” to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental. We also apply the provisions of SFAS, No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement — For subscription and term licenses and hardware leases, we use the signed contract as evidence of an arrangement. For perpetual licenses, hardware sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service projects, such as training classes and small, standard methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 or less, we use a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. For all other service engagements, we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. Sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Product delivery — Software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of free-on-board shipping point. Our software license agreements generally do not contain acceptance provisions. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its installation. Fee is fixed or determinable — We assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. We use installment contracts that extend up to a maximum of five years from the contract date for certain term and subscription licenses and we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments, products or services. Our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment have payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected quarterly in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. 31 Table of Contents Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable, including assessing whether a contract amendment constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we no longer had a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. This change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Collection is probable — We have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with entities in certain countries. For all other countries, we assess collectibility at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the customer’s past payment history and its current creditworthiness. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement with installment payment terms, revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment. This change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Vendor-Specific Objective Evidence of Fair Value — Our VSOE for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in the arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as elements are delivered. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate VSOE. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we could no longer support VSOE for undelivered elements of multiple element arrangements, revenue would be deferred until we have VSOE for the undelivered elements or all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. This change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Finance Fee Revenue — Finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the contract effective date. Finance fees are recognized ratably over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented 2% of total revenue for 2004, 1% of total revenue for 2003 and 1% of total revenue for 2002. Services revenue — Services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing methodology and design services. These services are not related to the functionality of our software licenses. Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. This change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Accounting for income taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense 32 Table of Contents (benefit) is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates, relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets, take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from potential sources including tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus materially affecting our results of operations and financial position. See the factors affecting future results above in Item 1, “Business” entitled “Our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates,” “We have received an examination report from the Internal Revenue Service proposing a tax deficiency in certain of our tax returns, and the outcome of the examination or any future examinations involving similar claims may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows” and “Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations.” Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, including goodwill At least annually we review goodwill resulting from business combinations for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Our annual impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including the goodwill related to the reporting unit. To determine the reporting unit’s fair value, we utilize a combination of the income and market valuation approaches. The income approach provides an estimate of fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows. These expected future cash flows are based on our assumed market segment growth rates, assumed market segment share growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of the equity of a business by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. The conditions and prospects of companies in similar lines of business depend on common factors such as overall demand for their products and services. Factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment are also analyzed and compared to comparable companies. Various price or market multiples are then applied to our reporting units’ operating results to arrive at an estimate of fair value. In determining our overall conclusion of reporting unit fair value, we considered the estimated values derived from both the income and market valuation approaches. The weighting applied to the market approach depends on the similarity of the comparable businesses to the reporting unit. We review long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” 33 Table of Contents For long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired intangibles, we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset, excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment is required in: • identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances; • forecasting future operating results; and • estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long-lived or intangible assets. Material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made. Restructuring charges We account for restructuring charges in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, “Restructuring and Impairment Charges.” Since fiscal 2001, we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives. All restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” and EITF No. 88-10, “Costs Associated with Lease Modifications or Terminations.” For restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002, we accounted for the facilities and asset-related portions of these restructurings in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” In addition, for all years presented, we accounted for the facilities and asset-related portions of these restructurings in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The severance and benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, “Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43.” These restructuring initiatives have required us to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly estimating when, if at all, we will be able to sublet vacated facilities and if we do, the sublease terms. Closure and space reduction costs that are part of our restructuring charges include payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities during the abandonment period. In addition, we have recorded estimated provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs, and other restructuring costs. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our restructuring accrual, and adjust the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions. We may incur future charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded. Results of Operations We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software and selling or leasing hardware technology and intellectual property, providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design and methodology services. We principally utilize three license types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types provide a customer with different rights to use our products such as (i) the right to access new technology, (ii) the duration of the license, and (iii) payment terms. Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed term of use, this will result in either a subscription or term license. A business implication of that decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups, rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license. See 34 Table of Contents “Critical Accounting Estimates” above for additional discussion of license types and timing of revenue recognition. To the extent a customer obtains rights to remix to new technology or more flexible payment terms, revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement. This distinction is a critical determinant of revenue recognition. For example, a $3.0 million, 3-year product subscription license would result in $1.0 million of revenue recognized per year, or $250,000 per quarter. However, a $3.0 million, 3-year product term license, assuming equal or near equal payments and no rights to new technology, would result in $3.0 million of revenue recognized upon delivery, which is generally in the first quarter of the arrangement, and no revenue recognized in succeeding quarters. With each succeeding quarter in which the number of product licenses where revenue recognition is deferred increases, our revenue from backlog also increases. Product revenue recognized from backlog comprised approximately 68% of total product revenue in 2004, 60% in 2003 and 45% in 2002. As long as customers continue to prefer subscription licenses, we expect that revenue from backlog will increase and our revenue will be less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in volume. Because our model leads to a substantial portion of our revenue being recognized over multiple periods, we do not believe that pricing volatility has been a material component of the change in our product revenue from period to period, and we have not analyzed changes in pricing from one period to the next. The amount of product revenue in future periods will depend, among other things, on the terms and timing of our contract renewals or additional product sales with existing customers, the size of such transactions or renewals, and sales to new customers. Product revenue in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers prefer subscription, term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms. Revenue is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and changes in license types (e.g., subscription to term) for existing customers. Contract renewals, and consequently product revenues, are also affected by the competitiveness of our products. During 2005, we plan to continue optimizing our operations. In the first quarter of 2005, we announced a plan of restructuring that will reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees. This will result in an estimated restructuring and other expense of approximately $18.0 million to $20.0 million in 2005. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $30.0 million related to this plan of restructuring. On January 12, 2005, we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Verisity Ltd., or Verisity, a Mountain View, California-based provider of verification process automation solutions. If completed, the merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under the terms of the agreement, upon satisfaction of the closing conditions contained therein (including receipt of certain governmental and Verisity shareholder approvals), we will acquire Verisity in an all-cash transaction for approximately $315.0 million to $335.0 million, which consists of payments to stockholders and acquisition costs. Upon closing of the acquisition, Verisity stockholders will receive $12 in cash in exchange for each outstanding share of Verisity stock. Revenue and Revenue Mix by Product Group We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into “platforms,” which are included in the various product groups described below. We introduced our first platform in September 2002. The data described below for product groups for periods before a platform was introduced aggregates the revenues from the individual products associated with that particular platform. Our product groups are: Functional Verification: Products in this group, which include the Incisivetm functional verification platform, are used to verify that the high level, logical specification of an integrated circuit design is correct. 35 Table of Contents Digital IC Design: Products in this group, which include the Encountertm digital IC design platform, are used to accurately convert the high-level, logical specification of a digital integrated circuit into a detailed physical blueprint of the integrated circuit, which is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture. Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, which include the Virtuoso® custom design platform, are used for integrated circuits that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, radio frequency, memories, high performance digital blocks, and standard cell libraries. Design for Manufacturing: Included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. System Interconnect: This product group consists of our printed circuit board and integrated circuit package design products, including the Allegro® system interconnect design platform, which enables consistent co-design of integrated circuits, IC packages, and printed circuit boards. Revenue by Year The table below shows our revenue for the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002: % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 (In millions) Product $ 729.8 $ 663.5 $ 806.8 10% (18)% Services 137.0 131.2 149.8 4% (12)% Maintenance 330.7 324.8 331.3 2% (2)% Total revenue $ 1,197.5 $ 1,119.5 $ 1,287.9 7% (13)% 2004 compared to 2003 Product revenue was higher in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital IC and System Interconnect products and sales of certain intellectual property. Services revenue increased in 2004 due to an increase in customer spending for design services as the electronics industry experienced some recovery from the economic downturn of 2002 and 2003. 2003 compared to 2002 Product revenue was lower in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to the shift to more ratable licenses and lower sales volume. Services revenue was lower in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to a decrease in customer spending for design services as a result of the economic downturn experienced in the electronics industry at that time. 36 Table of Contents Revenue by Product Group The following table shows for 2004, 2003 and 2002 the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups, and Services and other: 2004 2003 2002 Functional Verification 17% 19% 19% Digital IC Design 25% 23% 22% Custom IC Design 27% 27% 26% Design for Manufacturing 9% 10% 10% System Interconnect 9% 9% 11% Services and other 13% 12% 12% Total 100% 100% 100% During 2004, we recognized $11.0 million of revenue from the sale of intellectual property, or IP. This sale of IP is included in Services and other in the preceding table and in Product revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue by Geography % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 (In millions) U.S. $ 598.9 $ 623.7 $ 710.0 (4)% (12)% Other North America 27.0 26.3 29.2 3% (10)% Total North America 625.9 650.0 739.2 (4)% (12)% Europe 261.9 187.9 257.9 39% (27)% Japan 191.2 187.9 188.8 2% 0% Asia 118.5 93.7 102.0 27% (8)% Total Japan and Asia 309.7 281.6 290.8 10% (3)% Total revenue $ 1,197.5 $ 1,119.5 $ 1,287.9 7% (13)% Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue 2004 2003 2002 U.S. 50% 56% 55% Other North America 2% 2% 2% Europe 22% 17% 20% Japan 16% 17% 15% Asia 10% 8% 8% Total revenue 100% 100% 100% The rate of revenue change varies geographically due to differences in the timing and extent of term license renewals for existing customers in those regions. In addition, both our domestic and international businesses have been affected by the revenue trends discussed above in this section entitled “Results of Operations.” Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by $16.0 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, and to increase by $18.8 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to 37 Table of Contents strengthening of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar. Additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of Revenue % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 (In millions) Product $ 82.0 $ 67.0 $ 98.3 22% (32)% Services 91.0 93.2 114.7 (2)% (19)% Maintenance 53.0 56.5 65.1 (6)% (13)% Cost of Revenue as a Percent of Related Revenue 2004 2003 2002 Product 11% 10% 12% Services 66% 71% 77% Maintenance 16% 17% 20% Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salaries and benefits, amortization of intangible assets directly related to Cadence products, the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product associated with our Cadence Verification Acceleration, or CVA, hardware products also includes materials, assembly labor and overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software product. A summary of Cost of product is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Product related costs $ 38.0 $ 28.0 $ 63.8 Amortization of acquired intangibles 44.0 39.0 25.2 Inventory write-off — — 9.3 Total Cost of product $ 82.0 $ 67.0 $ 98.3 2004 compared to 2003 Cost of product increased $15.0 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase of $18.0 million in cost of goods sold for our hardware business resulting from increased sales of our hardware products, and an increase of $5.0 million in amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in royalty expenses and a $3.6 million decrease in amortized software costs. Cost of product in the future will depend primarily upon the actual mix of hardware and software product contracts in any given period and the degree to which we license and incorporate third-party technology in our products licensed or sold in any given period. Cost of services primarily includes employee salary and benefits, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services decreased $2.2 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a decrease in salary and benefit costs resulting from decreases in employees in our services business. Services gross margin as a percentage of services revenue increased during 2004, as compared to 2003, due to increased services revenues and decreased cost of services. 38 Table of Contents Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support, production employees and documentation of maintenance updates. Cost of maintenance revenue decreased $3.5 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to a $2.3 million decrease in salary and benefit costs and a $1.2 million decrease in information technology, facilities and general operating expenses. 2003 compared to 2002 Cost of product decreased $31.3 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to an $18.9 million reduction in amortized software costs, an $8.3 million decrease in royalties expense, a $9.3 million decrease in inventory write-offs, and a $2.2 million decrease in acquisition-related write-offs. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles of $13.8 million during 2003. Cost of services decreased $21.5 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from our reduction of services professionals in connection with our restructuring actions initiated in 2002 and 2003. As a result, services gross margin as a percentage of services revenue increased during 2003, as compared to 2002. Cost of maintenance decreased $8.6 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a decrease in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from a decrease in employee headcount. Operating Expenses % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 (In millions) Marketing and sales $ 325.9 $ 326.6 $ 402.1 0 % (19) % Research and development 351.3 340.1 326.4 3 % 4 % General and administrative 83.4 82.6 115.8 1 % (29) % Total operating expenses $ 760.6 $ 749.3 $ 844.3 2 % (11) % Operating Expenses as a Percent of Total Revenue 2004 2003 2002 Marketing and sales 27% 29% 31% Research and development 29% 30% 25% General and administrative 7% 7% 9% Operating Expense Summary 2004 compared to 2003 Operating expenses increased $11.3 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $31.8 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs, primarily due to bonuses earned in 2004 that had not been earned in 2003. This increase was partially offset by a $13.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, a $7.4 million decrease in outside services and a $7.2 million decrease in commission payments to Innotech Corporation, or Innotech, as a result of our acquisition from Innotech in 2003 of distribution rights to certain of its customers. Foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by $10.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro, British pound and Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar. We expect our operating expenses to increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to our pending acquisition of Verisity Ltd. 39 Table of Contents 2003 compared to 2002 Operating expenses declined $95.0 million during 2003, as compared to 2002, as a result of the cost reductions from our 2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described more fully below in “Restructuring and Other Charges.” Foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by $11.3 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar. Marketing and Sales 2004 compared to 2003 Marketing and sales expenses decreased $0.7 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $7.2 million decrease in commission payments to Innotech as a result of our acquisition from Innotech of distribution rights to certain of its customers and a $3.1 million reduction in depreciation related to prior restructuring activities. This decrease was partially offset by a $7.7 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs and a $2.2 million increase in marketing program costs. 2003 compared to 2002 Marketing and sales expenses decreased $75.5 million during 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a $27.8 million decrease in employee salaries and benefits and related costs resulting from our restructuring activities, a $16.1 million decrease in commission costs, a $12.6 million decrease in outside services costs, and a $4.1 million decrease in marketing program costs. Salary, benefits and commission costs declined due to reduced headcount in the sales and marketing organizations. Outside services costs declined due to decreased commission payments to Innotech and a reduction in costs incurred for outside contractors and consultants. Research and Development 2004 compared to 2003 Research and development expense increased $11.2 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $21.4 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs resulting from an increase in employees due to business acquisitions and increased staffing to support strategic technologies. This increase was partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in expenses related to our use of outside services and a $3.2 million decrease in costs associated with outsourced research and development projects. 2003 compared to 2002 The increase in Research and development expense of $13.7 million for 2003, as compared to 2002, was primarily due to a $14.1 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs resulting from an increase in employees due to business acquisitions and increased staffing to support strategic technologies and an $18.9 million reduction in capitalized development costs, partially offset by an $11.5 million reduction in costs related to outsourced services and research and development projects as a result of the restructuring activities, and a $5.6 million decrease in expenses related to our use of other outside services. General and Administrative 2004 compared to 2003 General and administrative expense increased $0.8 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs and a $2.6 million increase in professional fees related to our annual audit and Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. This increase was partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in legal expenses, a $2.4 million decrease in bad debt expense and a $1.3 million decrease in insurance expense. 40 Table of Contents 2003 compared to 2002 General and administrative expense decreased $33.2 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a $16.6 million decrease in legal expense, a $9.3 million decrease in salary and benefit costs in connection with our restructuring activities and a $2.2 million decrease in bad debt expense. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total receivables declined in 2003, as compared to 2002, because write-offs continued to decline and because of additional reductions in the percentage of receivables past due. There were no significant changes in our collection policies or payment terms from 2002 to 2003. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 55.7 $ 62.6 $ 53.8 2004 compared to 2003 Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $6.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to an $11.4 million decrease in the amortization of acquired intangibles reflecting the full amortization of intangible assets from prior year acquisitions, partially offset by increases of $5.6 million in amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with our previously completed acquisitions. We expect an increase in the amortization of acquired intangibles in 2005 due to the pending acquisition of Verisity Ltd. as described more fully in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 2003 compared to 2002 Amortization of acquired intangibles increased $8.8 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a $10.8 million increase in amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with our previously completed acquisitions. Amortization of Deferred Stock Compensation 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Amortization of deferred stock compensation $ 31.4 $ 41.1 $ 44.0 We amortize deferred stock compensation related to fixed awards using the straight-line method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock vest. We recognize stock compensation expense related to variable awards using an accelerated method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock are earned. 2004 compared to 2003 Amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased $9.7 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to a $24.6 million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock compensation primarily related to our previously completed acquisitions. This decrease was partially offset by a $14.9 million increase in the amortization of deferred stock compensation primarily related to incentive stock grants. We expect that amortization of deferred stock compensation will increase in 2005 due to increased incentive stock grants during 2004 and our adoption of SFAS No. 123R in our third quarter of 2005 as described more fully in “New Accounting Standards” below. 2003 compared to 2002 Amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased $2.9 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a $14.8 million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to our previously completed acquisitions. This decrease was partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in the 41 Table of Contents amortization of deferred stock compensation related to Verplex, and a $2.2 million increase in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the mark-to-market of options granted to consultants. Restructuring and Other Charges We have initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year since 2001 in an effort to reduce operating expenses and improve operating margins and cash flows. The restructuring plans initiated in 2001, 2002 and 2003, or the 2001 Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring and 2003 Restructuring, respectively, were intended to decrease costs by reducing workforce and consolidating facilities and resources, to align our cost structure with expected revenues. The 2001 and 2002 Restructurings primarily related to our design services business and certain other business or infrastructure groups throughout the world. The 2003 Restructuring was targeted at reducing costs throughout the company. During 2004, we commenced a new plan of restructuring, or the 2004 Restructuring, which was also intended to decrease costs and realize efficiencies by reducing workforce and resources throughout the company to align our cost structure with expected revenues. A summary of restructuring and other charges by plan of restructuring for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows: Severance and Asset- Excess Other Benefits Related Facilities Restructuring Total (In millions) 2004: 2004 Plan $ 7.0 $ 0.2 $ — $ 9.4 $ 16.6 2003 Plan (0.8 ) (2.8 ) 1.5 — (2.1 ) 2002 Plan (0.5 ) (1.2 ) 0.1 — (1.6 ) 2001 Plan — — 0.6 — 0.6 Total 2004 $ 5.7 $ (3.8 ) $ 2.2 $ 9.4 $ 13.5 2003: 2003 Plan $ 25.7 $ 25.7 $ 10.9 $ — $ 62.3 2002 Plan 0.8 0.4 1.5 — 2.7 2001 Plan — — 1.8 — 1.8 Total 2003 $ 26.5 $ 26.1 $ 14.2 $ — $ 66.8 2002: 2002 Plan $ 52.1 $ 34.2 $ 32.4 $ 1.1 $ 119.8 2001 Plan — — 14.5 — 14.5 Total 2002 $ 52.1 $ 34.2 $ 46.9 $ 1.1 $ 134.3 Frequently, asset impairments are based on significant estimates and assumptions, particularly regarding remaining useful life and utilization rates. We may incur other charges in the future if management determines that the useful life or utilization of certain long-lived assets has been reduced. Closure and space reduction costs included payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs, and costs to maintain facilities during the abandonment period. To determine the lease loss, which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building, certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms, including sublease rates and contractual common area charges. As of January 1, 2005, our best estimate of the accrued lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring activities initiated since 2001 is $33.7 million. This amount will be adjusted in the future based upon changes 42 Table of Contents in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. The lease loss could range as high as $53.2 million if sublease rental rates decrease in applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities. Since 2001, we have recorded facilities consolidation charges under the 2001 through 2004 Restructurings of $85.2 million related to reducing space in or the closing of 34 sites, of which 24 have been vacated and 10 have been downsized. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring activities may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. The following is further discussion of the activity under each restructuring plan: During 2005, we plan to continue optimizing our operations. In the first quarter of 2005, we announced a plan of restructuring that will reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees. This will result in an estimated restructuring and other expense of approximately $18.0 million to $20.0 million in 2005. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $30.0 million related to this plan of restructuring. 2004 Restructuring — The 2004 Restructuring resulted in the termination of approximately 130 employees. Costs resulting from this restructuring included severance payments, severance-related benefits and outplacement services. All terminations and termination benefits associated with this restructuring were communicated to the affected employees prior to January 1, 2005, with all termination benefits expected to be paid by July 2, 2005. We project annualized savings in employee salary and benefits costs of approximately $20.0 million resulting from employee terminations under the 2004 Restructuring. Other expenses of $9.4 million related to the abandonment of third-party software purchased and integrated an into an internal-use software application. During 2004, we replaced this third-party purchased software with internally developed technology. Upon deployment of the internally developed software we recorded a charge to reduce the value of the third-party software product and implementation costs to zero. 2003 Restructuring — During 2004, we recorded a net credit of $2.1 million related to the 2003 Restructuring. This net credit is comprised of a $2.8 million credit associated with asset-related charges, and a $0.8 million severance and benefits credit, partially offset by $1.5 million of additional excess facilities charges. The net $2.8 million asset-related credit was associated with the reversal of an accrual of approximately $4.6 million for an expected payment to a government agency because we have determined it is not probable we will have any future liability. This reversal was partially offset by a $1.2 million accrual for fees related to headcount reductions at a foreign facility. We also reversed $0.8 million of the severance-related accrual related to payroll taxes, benefits and outplacement services in excess of the remaining expected obligation. We incurred excess facilities expenses of $1.5 million in the year ended January 1, 2005 related to the 2003 Restructuring. These expenses were primarily comprised of additional expenses incurred for facilities included in the 2003 Restructuring, but vacated during fiscal 2004. Expenses also included contract termination charges and expenses incurred to sublease facilities and storage and disposal charges associated with facilities vacated as part of the 2003 Restructuring. We expect to incur an additional $4.0 million to $6.0 million of future costs in connection with the 2003 Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges, which will be expensed as incurred. The actual amount of additional costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities. 2002 Restructuring — During 2004, we recorded a net credit of $1.6 million related to the 2002 Restructuring. This net credit is comprised of the reversal of $1.2 million of accrued contract termination costs 43 Table of Contents not incurred and $0.4 million of the severance and benefits accrual in excess of the remaining expected obligation, partially offset by $0.1 million of additional excess facilities charges. 2001 Restructuring — We recorded facilities-related expenses of $0.6 million during 2004 primarily due to changes in lease loss estimates and costs associated with facilities vacated as part of the 2001 restructuring plan. Write-off of Acquired In-Process Research and Development Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to expense any acquired in-process research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired in-process research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established. The values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process research and development. Described below are the write-offs of acquired in-process research and development charges in 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Neolinear, Inc. $ 7.0 $ — — Get2Chip.com, Inc. — 3.8 — Verplex Systems, Inc. — 2.0 — Celestry Design Technologies, Inc. — 1.7 — Simplex Solutions, Inc. — — 27.4 IBM Test Design Automation Group — — 6.6 Other 2004 acquisition 2.0 — — Total in process technology $ 9.0 $ 7.5 $ 34.0 We expect an increase in Write-off of acquired in-process research and development in 2005, as compared to 2004, assuming our pending acquisition of Verisity Ltd. is completed. 44 Table of Contents Described below is a summary of in-process research and development acquired during 2004, 2003 and 2002 as of January 1, 2005: Estimated Expenditures Remaining Incurred to Expenditures Complete To Complete In-Process In-Process Research Research Discount Commercial and and Rates Feasibility Development Development (In millions) Neolinear, Inc. 28% December 2004 $ 7.2 $ — Other 2004 acquisition 30% December 2004 0.8 — Get2Chip.com, Inc. 30% June 2005 5.5 1.0 Verplex Systems, Inc. 30% November 2004 2.6 — Celestry Design Technologies, Inc. 35% March 2003 2.0 — Simplex Solutions, Inc. 30% April 2003 4.2 — IBM Test Design Automation Group 24% October 2003 9.9 — Total Expenditures $ 32.2 $ 1.0 Interest Expense 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Interest expense $ 6.2 $ 5.0 $ 2.8 2004 compared to 2003 Interest expense increased $1.2 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million in amortization expense related to the costs associated with the issuance of our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes, or the Notes, in August 2003, an increase of $1.3 million in imputed interest on acquisition-related payments which occur over time, partially offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in interest expense related to our credit facilities that were terminated in 2003 after the issuance of the Notes. 2003 compared to 2002 Interest expense increased $2.2 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to an increase of $1.7 million in imputed interest on acquisition-related payments which occur over time and an increase of $0.8 million of amortization expense related to the costs associated with the issuance of our Notes, partially offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in interest expense related to our credit facilities that were terminated in 2003 after the issuance of the Notes. 45 Table of Contents Other expense, net Other expense, net, for the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Interest income $ 5.6 $ 3.4 $ 4.6 Gain (loss) on foreign exchange (1.4 ) 2.3 (0.3 ) Equity in loss from investments, net (16.9 ) (10.9 ) (9.4 ) Other income (expense) 4.2 (10.4 ) (8.7 ) Total other expense, net $ (8.5 ) $ (15.6 ) $ (13.8 ) In 2004, the Other income of $4.2 million is comprised of $12.5 million of gains on the sale of investments and $0.4 million of other income, net, offset by $4.2 million of impairment of investments, $2.5 million of investment management fees paid to manage the Telos venture partnerships described under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and $2.0 million of losses on the sale of receivables. In 2003, the Other expense of $10.4 million is comprised of $4.8 million of impairment of investments, $5.0 million of losses on the sale of receivables and $0.6 million of Other expense, net. In 2002, the Other expense of $8.7 million is comprised of $14.1 million of impairment of investments, $15.1 million of losses on the sale of receivables, $24.9 million of gains on the sale of investments and $4.4 million of Other expense, net. We expect our equity in loss from investments, net, to decrease in 2005 as a result of the adoption of EITF No. 02-14 as more fully described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 12.0 $ (13.0 ) $ 83.7 Effective tax rate 13.8% 42.5% 58.1% 2004 compared to 2003 The income before provision for income taxes resulted in a provision for income taxes in 2004 compared to a benefit for income taxes in 2003. The 2004 provision for income taxes has a greater benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. federal statutory rate when compared to 2003. 2003 compared to 2002 The loss before provision for income taxes resulted in a benefit for income taxes in 2003 compared to a provision for income taxes in 2002. The 2003 benefit has a greater detriment from non-deductible amortization of stock compensation expense partially offset by a greater benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. federal statutory rate in comparison to 2002. Outlook for 2005 Excluding the impact of the potential acquisition of Verisity Ltd., we are currently projecting an increase in our effective income tax rate for 2005 primarily due to a reduced benefit from foreign income taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. federal statutory rate in comparison to 2004. We are not yet in a position to reasonably estimate the effective income tax rate for 2005 as we are currently studying the impact of certain new tax rules in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or AJCA, the pending adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and the completion of our pending acquisition of Verisity Ltd. 46 Table of Contents The total valuation allowance on deferred tax assets increased by $0.6 million during 2004. As of January 1, 2005, the valuation allowance is $7.8 million and is related to deferred tax assets for certain states where realization is not judged to be likely. As of January 1, 2005, we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately $106.8 million. Realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however, could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts, including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from those estimated. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings and, accordingly, have not provided for the U.S. or foreign taxes that would be incurred if such earnings were repatriated to the U.S. The AJCA, enacted on October 22, 2004, created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations. Although no decision has been made regarding repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA, we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriated during fiscal 2005. We are currently evaluating the merits of repatriating funds under the AJCA and expect to complete this evaluation by October 1, 2005. The range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $550.0 million. We have historically considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, have not provided for income taxes on these undistributed earnings. If we decide to repatriate foreign earnings in a future period, we will be required to recognize income tax expense related to the federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that we would incur on the repatriated earnings when the decision is made. We are currently unable to reasonably estimate the possible range of income tax effects of such repatriation. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or the RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million, plus interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates have been between four and nine percent since 1997, and are adjusted quarterly. The IRS may also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999 in future examinations. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have protested certain of the proposed adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS where the matter is presently being considered. The most significant of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws, and that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. We intend to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously. The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we have assessed the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations, including the current IRS examination and the IRS RAR for tax years 1997 through 1999. However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues. In addition, we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination, we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the period or periods recorded. 47 Table of Contents Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and costs associated with foreign currency hedges. We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. The table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with maturities between three and 12 months are considered to be short-term investments. Held to maturity investments with maturities greater than 12 months are considered long-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value at January 1, 2005. Carrying Average Value Interest Rate (In millions) Interest-Bearing Instruments: Commercial paper — fixed rate $ 286.0 2.39 % Auction rate securities 108.2 2.63 % Cash — variable rate 85.1 0.93 % Cash equivalents — variable rate 57.8 1.88 % Total interest-bearing instruments $ 428.9 2.04 % Foreign Currency Risk Our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening U.S. dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening U.S. dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. Foreign currency fluctuations positively impacted our income by $3.7 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, and $2.6 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other expense, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities. 48 Table of Contents Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 180 days or less. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with underlying asset and liability exposures. The table below provides information, as of January 1, 2005, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The information is provided in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts mature prior to March 18, 2005. Weighted Average Notional Contract Principal Rate (In millions) Forward Contracts: Japanese yen $ 91.5 105.76 Euro 18.6 0.75 British pound sterling 14.5 0.52 Canadian dollars 8.0 1.24 Taiwan dollars 7.2 32.42 Hong Kong dollars 6.5 7.76 Other 10.9 — $ 157.2 Estimated fair value $ (1.8 ) While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Equity Price Risk In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of the Notes to two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $406.4 million after transaction fees of approximately $13.6 million. The Notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The Notes do not contain restrictive financial covenants. Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will initially be convertible into 63.879 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to maturity only if: (1) the price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during certain periods of time specified in the Notes, (2) specified corporate transactions occur, (3) the Notes have been called for redemption or (4) the trading price of the Notes falls below a certain threshold. As of January 1, 2005, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met. In addition, in the event of a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for 100% of the principal amount. 49 Table of Contents Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with JP Morgan Chase Bank, whereby we have the option to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately $134.6 million. As of January 1, 2005, the estimated fair value of the convertible notes hedge transactions was $100.8 million. In addition, we sold to JP Morgan Chase Bank warrants to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants. As of January 1, 2005, the estimated fair value of the sold warrants was $32.2 million. For additional discussion of the Notes see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. Our equity investments primarily are made in privately-held companies either as direct investments or through our Telos venture partnerships described under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. From time to time we make cash investments in companies with distinctive technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. The fair value of our portfolio of marketable equity securities, which are included in Short-term investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, was $35.9 million as of January 1, 2005 and $33.6 million as of January 3, 2004. While we actively monitor these investments, we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $45.7 million as of January 1, 2005 and $53.3 million as of January 3, 2004. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists for a non-marketable equity security, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write-down as an investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 50 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of and for the years ended January 1, % January 3, % December 28, 2005 Change 2004 Change 2002 (In millions, except percentages) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 593.0 42 % $ 418.4 6 % $ 395.6 Working Capital $ 521.0 45 % $ 360.3 42 % $ 254.3 Cash provided by operating activities $ 372.5 118 % $ 171.0 (51 )% $ 347.7 Cash used for investing activities $ (215.0 ) (44 )% $ (386.3 ) 140 % $ (151.1 ) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ (21.1 ) (114 )% $ 149.2 (376 )% $ (54.1 ) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments During the fourth quarter of 2004, we reclassified auction rate securities of $75.4 million as of January 3, 2004 and $15.0 million as of December 28, 2002 from Cash and cash equivalents to Short-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have reclassified the purchases and sales of these auction rate securities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which decreased Cash flows from investing activities by $60.4 million for the year ended January 3, 2004 and $15.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2002. At January 1, 2005, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $593.0 million of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments, as compared to $418.4 million at January 3, 2004 and $395.6 million at December 28, 2002. The primary sources of our cash in 2004 and 2003 were customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or lease of our hardware products, payments for the provision of design and methodology services, proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes in 2003, proceeds from the sale of receivables and from the exercise of stock options and common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans. Our primary uses of cash in 2004 and 2003 consisted of payments relating to payroll, product, services and other operating expenses, taxes, the hedge for our convertible notes to manage equity dilution, purchases of treasury stock and business acquisitions. Net working capital At January 1, 2005, we had net working capital of $521.0 million, as compared with $360.3 million at January 3, 2004 and $254.3 million at December 28, 2002. The increase in net working capital from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to the increase in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments of $174.6 million, an increase in Receivables, net, of $35.4 million, and an increase in Prepaid expense and other of $14.1 million, partially offset by an increase of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $34.5 million and an increase in Deferred revenue of $32.5 million. The increase in net working capital from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $51.9 million, an increase in Receivables, net, of $34.7 million, and an increase in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments of $22.8 million, partially offset by an increase in Deferred revenue of $30.7 million. Cash flows from operating activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment terms set forth in our license agreements. For a term license in which revenue is recognized upon delivery, payment of a substantial portion of the fee must be paid in the first year of the license. Our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment have payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and 51 Table of Contents the payments are collected quarterly in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer qualifying accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a non-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During 2004, we transferred accounts receivable totaling $30.1 million, which approximated fair value, to financing institutions on a non-recourse basis, as compared to $87.4 million in 2003 and $182.0 million in 2002. Provision for sales returns is accounted for as a reduction of revenue. Provision for sales returns decreased $8.5 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, and increased $1.2 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. 2004 compared to 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $201.5 million, to $372.5 million, during 2004, as compared to $171.0 million net cash provided by operating activities during 2003. The increase from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to an increase in net income of $92.0 million, an increase in cash received from Installment contract receivables of $128.5 million, a decrease in payments associated with Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $108.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in Proceeds from the sale of receivables of $57.3 million and a decrease of cash collected on Accounts receivable, net of $48.0 million. 2003 compared to 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $176.7 million, to $171.0 million, during 2003, as compared to $347.7 million net cash provided by operating activities during 2002. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to a reduction in net income of $77.9 million, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $35.9 million and a $26.5 million reduction in write-off of acquired in-process research and development. Cash flows from investing activities Our primary investing activities consisted of business acquisitions, purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing software licenses, purchasing technology and investing in venture capital partnership and equity investments, which combined represented $203.9 million of cash used for investing activities in 2004, as compared to $338.4 million in 2003 and $175.4 million in 2002. As part of our overall investment strategy, we are a limited partner in three venture capital funds, Telos Venture Partners, L.P., or Telos I, Telos Venture Partners II, L.P., or Telos II, and Telos Venture Partners III, L.P., or Telos III (Telos I, Telos II and Telos III are referred to collectively as Telos). We and certain of our deferred compensation trusts are the sole limited partners of Telos I and Telos III, and we are the sole limited partner of Telos II. The partnership agreements governing Telos I, Telos II and Telos III, which are substantially the same, require us to meet capital calls principally for the purpose of funding investments that are recommended by the applicable Telos general partner, and approved by the Telos advisory committee as being consistent with the partnership’s limitations and stated purposes. The Telos general partner, which is not affiliated with us, manages the partnerships and may be removed by us without cause. For all three partnerships, the advisory committee is comprised solely of the members of the Venture Committee of our Board of Directors, the current members of which are our Chairman of the Board of Directors and two independent members of our Board of Directors. As of January 1, 2005, we had contributed $96.3 million to these partnerships and are contractually committed to contribute to them up to an additional $69.1 million. Actual future contributions will depend upon the level of investments made by Telos. Our commitments expire concurrently with the termination date of each partnership, which, in the case of Telos I, is December 31, 2005, in the case of Telos II, is July 3, 2012, and, in the case of Telos III, is June 1, 2012. Our investments in the Telos partnerships are recorded in Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 52 Table of Contents 2004 compared to 2003 Net cash used for investing activities decreased by $171.3 million, to $215.0 million, during 2004, as compared to $386.3 million net cash used for investing activities during 2003. The decrease from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to a decrease of $67.1 million of net cash paid in business acquisitions, a decrease of $17.0 million of investments in venture capital partnership and equity investments, a decrease of $29.3 million in purchases of technology, a decrease of $21.1 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, an increase of $98.6 million of sales of short-term investments and an increase of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities and long-term investments of $14.9 million, partially offset by an increase of $71.2 million of purchases of short-term investments. During 2003, we received $9.1 million in cash from the sale-leaseback of certain equipment. We will make aggregate payments under the resulting operating leases of $9.1 million over the three to five year life of the operating leases. 2003 compared to 2002 Net cash used for investing activities increased by $235.2 million, to $386.3 million, during 2003, as compared to $151.1 million net cash used for investing activities during 2002. The increase from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to an increase of $147.6 million of net cash paid in business acquisitions, an increase of $448.7 million in purchases of short-term investments, a decrease of $49.4 million of proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities, an increase of $32.9 million of investments in venture capital partnership and equity investments, an increase of $29.3 million of purchases of technology, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of short-term investments of $403.3 million, a reduction in purchases of property, plant and equipment of $42.3 million, a reduction of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $10.1 million and a reduction of purchases of software licenses of $4.5 million. Cash flows from financing activities 2004 compared to 2003 Net cash used for financing activities was $21.1 million in 2004, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $149.2 million in 2003, a change of $162.5 million. In 2004, our primary use of cash from financing activities was the repurchase of $94.1 million of treasury stock, as compared to $213.8 million in 2003. As of January 1, 2005, the remaining repurchase authorization under our stock repurchase program totaled $123.0 million. Our primary source of cash from financing activities was $75.3 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase program, as compared to $86.6 million in 2003. In addition during 2003, we issued $420.0 million of convertible notes and received proceeds from the sale of common stock warrants and purchased convertible notes hedges for $134.6 million. 2003 compared to 2002 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $203.3 million from 2002 due to the issuance of our convertibles notes and sale of common stock warrants noted above, partially offset by an increase of $32.0 million in the purchase of treasury stock. We expect to continue our financing activity and may use cash reserves to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program. We may also consider additional hedging transactions if opportunities become available. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources We provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless these earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside of the United States. As of January 1, 2005, it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings. 53 Table of Contents On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. A key provision of the AJCA is a one-time incentive to repatriate foreign earnings at a reduced effective tax rate. A company must meet several requirements to qualify for the incentive and we are currently studying the impact of the AJCA’s repatriation provisions on our plans to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings. If we determine that we will dividend all or a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings, we will potentially incur additional foreign and U.S. federal, state and local income taxes in the period the dividend is made. As of January 1, 2005, the cumulative amount of earnings for which we have not provided a U.S. income tax accrual was approximately $575.0 million. The maximum dividend that may qualify for special treatment under the AJCA is the lower of approximately $550.0 million and the amount of our foreign earnings and profits at the time the dividend is made to one of our U.S. companies. We received an RAR from the IRS in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the tax years 1997 through 1999 of approximately $143.0 million, plus interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have filed a protest with the IRS to certain of the proposed adjustments. We are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously. The IRS may also make similar claims for tax returns filed for years subsequent to 1999. While we are protesting certain of the proposed adjustments, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of the tax examination, including the amount payable, or timing of such payments, which may materially impact our cash flows in the period or periods resolved. We expect to incur an additional $4.0 million to $6.0 million of future costs in connection with our restructuring activities, primarily for facilities-related charges connected with the 2004 Restructuring, which amounts will be expensed as incurred. We expect annualized cost reductions resulting from the 2004 Restructuring of approximately $20.0 million in employee salary and benefits costs, related to employee terminations under the restructuring plan. During 2005, we plan to continue optimizing our operations. In the first quarter of 2005, we announced a plan of restructuring that will reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees. This will result in an estimated restructuring and other expense of approximately $18.0 million to $20.0 million in 2005, which will result in cash payments of approximately $15.0 million to $17.0 million in 2005. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately $30.0 million related to this plan of restructuring. In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 to two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of approximately $406.4 million, after transaction fees of approximately $13.6 million that were recorded in Other assets and are being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over five years, which is the duration of the first redemption period. We issued the Notes at par and the Notes bear no interest. The Notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The Notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions whereby we have options to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately $134.6 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants. 54 Table of Contents In 2005, we expect to pay between $315.0 million to $335.0 million in cash payments to stockholders and acquisition costs to acquire Verisity Ltd. as more fully described in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. A summary of our contractual obligations as of January 1, 2005 follows: Payments Due by Period Less Than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter (In millions) Operating lease obligations $ 157.6 $ 31.8 $ 47.5 $ 30.4 $ 47.9 Purchase obligations 2.2 2.2 — — — Convertible notes 420.0 — — 420.0 — Other long-term contractual obligations 233.5 — 199.7 23.6 10.2 Total $ 813.3 $ 34.0 $ 247.2 $ 474.0 $ 58.1 The primary components of Other long-term obligations of $233.5 million related to indemnity holdbacks from acquisitions, contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions and deferred tax liabilities. In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $47.0 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional $36.0 million in cash during the three years following the next 12 months if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following are achieved in full: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment, an amendment of FASB Statements Nos. 123 and 95,” which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 123R in our third quarter of fiscal 2005. See “Stock-Based Incentive Compensation” of Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share amounts, for 2004, 2003 and 2002, as if we had used a fair-value-based method similar to the methods required under SFAS No. 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. Although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in future amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, we are evaluating the requirements under SFAS No. 123R and expect the adoption to decrease our net income during 2005 by approximately $25.0 million to $40.0 million. This estimated range was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, based on currently available option information. Our actual SFAS 123R compensation expense for fiscal 2005 could differ from this range, due to a difference in expense resulting from utilizing a lattice valuation model instead of the Black-Scholes model and equity grants at different levels than expected. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” The AJCA provides for a special 9% tax deduction on qualified production activities. FAS 109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction and not as a tax rate reduction in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income 55 Table of Contents Taxes.” The adoption of FAS 109-1 did have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” The AJCA was enacted on October 22, 2004 and created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations during fiscal 2005. FAS 109-2 provides guidance under SFAS No. 109 with respect to recording the potential impact of repatriation provisions of the AJCA on an enterprise’s income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FAS 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed additional time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the AJCA on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. We are currently evaluating the merits of repatriating funds under the AJCA and expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision by October 1, 2005. The range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $550.0 million. We have historically considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, we have not provided for income taxes on these undistributed earnings. If we decide to repatriate foreign earnings in a future period, we will be required to recognize income tax expense related to the federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that we would incur on the repatriated earnings when the decision is made. We are currently unable to reasonably estimate the possible range of income tax effects of such repatriation. In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments. Additionally, EITF No. 03-1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF No. 03-1; however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004. We have adopted the disclosure requirements and will evaluate the measurement requirements of EITF No. 03-1 once final guidance is issued. Item 7A.

We license software, sell or license intellectual property, sell or lease hardware technology and provide design and methodology services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics product development processes. Our broad range of products and services are used by the world’s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and personal and commercial electronics systems. During the last decade, the communications, business productivity and consumer electronics markets accounted for much of the growth in the electronics industry. Ever-decreasing silicon manufacturing process geometries, coupled with the move to 300 millimeter wafer production, are causing IC unit cost decreases. This has enabled die-per-wafer volume efficiencies and increased complexity for manufacturers of electronic devices. At the same time, the development of ICs with greater functionality makes it more difficult to effectively integrate these components into complete electronics systems. These market and technology forces create major challenges for the global electronics design community, while simultaneously offering significant opportunities for providers of EDA products and services. In response to these opportunities, we have initiated significant restructuring activities over the past several years, including during the year ended December 31, 2005, to better align our cost structure with projected demand for our products and services. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items more fully in the “Results of Operations” below. Acquisitions We have acquired companies, businesses and technology, some of which are described below, and we expect to acquire other companies, businesses and technology in the future. We undertake these acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy, and specifically, to acquire key personnel, technology and customer relationships of the acquired business. For each of these acquisitions the results of operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition. These acquisitions are described in more detail below and in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Table of Contents Comparative pro forma financial information was not presented for the acquisitions completed in 2005, 2004 or 2003 because these acquisitions were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements, either individually or in the aggregate. A summary of certain information regarding acquisitions, all of which were for cash, we completed in 2005, 2004 and 2003, including the aggregate initial purchase price paid, is as follows: Initial Purchase Price Date of Acquisition 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Verisity Ltd. (A) April 2005 $ 325.4 $ — $ — Neolinear, Inc. (B) April 2004 — 78.1 — Verplex Systems, Inc. (C) August 2003 — — 87.6 Innotech Corporation distribution rights (D) June 2003 — — 78.7 Get2Chip.com, Inc. (E) April 2003 — — 80.5 Celestry Design Technologies, Inc. (F) January 2003 — — 65.7 Other 2004 acquisition August 2004 — 9.2 — Other 2003 acquisitions Various — — 18.9 Total initial aggregate purchase price $ 325.4 $ 87.3 $ 331.4 The businesses or assets acquired include: (A) Verification process automation solutions. (B) Rapid analog design technology. (C) Functional verification technology. (D) Distribution rights to certain customers, certain assets and key personnel of this Japan-based developer and distributor of software, electronic devices and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. (E) Nanometer-scale synthesis. (F) Silicon modeling products and full-chip circuit simulation. The purchase prices of our acquisitions generally consist of one or more of the following: cash payments, shares of our common stock, the fair value of assumed options, if any, and acquisition costs. The purchase price and goodwill associated with certain business acquisitions will be greater than the initial purchase price paid if certain performance goals are achieved, generally over a period of up to four years following the completion of the respective acquisition, related to one or more of the following: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. Concurrent with our acquisition of certain Innotech assets, we also modified our distributor agreement with Innotech. Prior to this acquisition, we licensed most of our software products in Japan through Innotech. We now directly license our software products to the customers for which we acquired the distribution rights from Innotech. As of December 31, 2005, we were an approximately 7% stockholder of Innotech. Acquisition-Related Earnouts For many of our acquisitions of private companies, a portion of the purchase price is payable only after the acquired business group’s achievement of certain performance goals, which generally relate to one or more of the following: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition. In connection with some acquisitions, we may grant equity awards with either time-based or performance-based vesting, or a combination of both, to employees of the acquired business as performance incentives. As a result, the amount of cash consideration or shares of our common stock issued to former stockholders of the acquired entity will increase as the performance goals are achieved, generally over a period 29 Table of Contents of up to four years following the completion of the respective acquisition. Accordingly, goodwill and stock compensation expense will increase upon the attainment of such goals. In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $27.0 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional $7.0 million in cash in periods after the next 12 months through September 2008 if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following criteria are achieved in full: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. The goodwill recorded in connection with the below-described contingent earnouts for acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 2005 Earnouts During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded $27.5 million of goodwill for achieved earnouts payable to former stockholders of acquired companies. The $27.5 million of earnouts consisted of $23.5 million of cash payments made prior to December 31, 2005, the issuance of 0.1 million shares of our common stock valued at $1.3 million and $2.7 million accrued in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. 2004 Earnouts During 2004, we recorded $40.6 million of goodwill as contingent purchase price payable to stockholders of acquired companies. The $40.6 million of goodwill consisted of $17.0 million of actual cash payments, $7.2 million of accrued payments and the issuance of 1.1 million shares of our common stock valued at $16.4 million. In addition, we recognized stock compensation expense of $1.2 million in connection with these acquisitions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB No. 25).” 2003 Earnouts During 2003, we paid $2.4 million in cash and issued or reserved for issuance an additional 3.7 million shares of our common stock valued at $57.7 million related to acquisition earnouts. We recorded $52.3 million in additional goodwill consisting of $2.4 million in cash and $49.9 million representing the issuance or reserve for issuance of 3.2 million shares. We also recorded additional stock compensation expense of $7.8 million representing the issuance or reserve for issuance of 0.4 million shares for earnouts achieved during 2003. In addition, we recorded $0.5 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated future earnouts in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.” Legal Settlements In September 2003, we entered into a settlement with Mentor Graphics Corporation, pursuant to which Cadence, Mentor and their respective affiliated parties settled all outstanding litigation between the companies and such affiliated parties relating to emulation and acceleration systems. The companies also agreed that, for a period of seven years, neither will sue the other over patented emulation and acceleration technology. Mentor also paid us $18.0 million in cash as part of the settlement. Net of related legal costs, we recorded a gain of $14.5 million during the year ended January 3, 2004 for the settlement. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different 30 Table of Contents assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, restructuring charges and valuation of stock-based awards have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue recognition We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9 “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,” to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental. We also apply the provisions of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists. We license software using three different license types: • Subscription licenses — software licensed for a specific time period, generally two to three years, with no rights to return and limited rights to exchange the licensed software for unspecified technology in the future. In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product. • Term licenses — software licensed for a specific time period, generally two to three years, with no rights to return and, generally, limited rights to exchange the licensed software for technology available at the time of purchase. In general, revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product. • Perpetual licenses — software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software. In general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement — Generally, we use the customer signed contract as evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases. If a customer signed contract does not exist, we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service projects, such as training classes and small methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other service engagements, we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement. Sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Product delivery — Software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of free-on-board, or F.O.B., shipping point. Our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point. 31 Table of Contents Fee is fixed or determinable — We assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. We have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments, products or services. For our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment, we may only determine that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable, including assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Collection is probable — We have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries. For all other countries, we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the customer’s payment history and its current creditworthiness. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement, particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value — Our VSOE for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate VSOE. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we could no longer support VSOE for undelivered elements of multiple element arrangements, revenue would be deferred until we have VSOE for the undelivered elements or all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Finance fee revenue — Finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees are recognized using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented 2% of total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 and 1% of total revenue for the year ended January 3, 2004. Upon the sale of an installment contract, we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract. Services revenue — Services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing design and methodology services. These services are not related to the functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly 32 Table of Contents basis the percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Accounting for income taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense (benefit) is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from potential sources including tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus materially affecting our results of operations and financial position. See the factors affecting future results above in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” entitled “Our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates,” “We have received an examination report from the Internal Revenue Service proposing a tax deficiency in certain of our tax returns, and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows” and “Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations.” Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets We review long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired intangibles, we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset, excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment is required in: • identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances; • forecasting future operating results; and • estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long-lived or intangible assets. 33 Table of Contents In future periods, material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made. Restructuring charges We account for restructuring charges in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, “Restructuring and Impairment Charges,” as amended. Since fiscal 2001, we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives. All restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” and EITF No. 88-10, “Costs Associated with Lease Modifications or Terminations.” For restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002, we accounted for the leased facilities in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” In addition, for all periods presented, we accounted for the asset-related portions of these restructurings in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For all periods presented, the severance and benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, “Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43.” These restructuring initiatives have required us to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly estimating when, if at all, we will be able to sublet vacated facilities and, if we do, the sublease terms. Closure and space reduction costs that are part of our restructuring charges include payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities during the abandonment period. In addition, we have recorded estimated provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs and other restructuring costs. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our restructuring accrual, and adjust the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions. We may incur future charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded. Valuation of stock-based awards Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we will account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Under SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected. Results of Operations We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software, selling or leasing our hardware technology, selling or licensing our intellectual property, providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design and methodology services. We principally utilize three license types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types provide a customer with different terms of use for our products, such as (i) the right to access new technology, (ii) the duration of the license, and (iii) payment terms. Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed term of use, this will result in either a subscription or term license. A business implication of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups, rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration 34 Table of Contents of the license. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” above for additional discussion of license types and timing of revenue recognition. A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over multiple periods. As a result, we do not believe that pricing volatility has been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period. The amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the terms and timing of our contract renewals or additional product sales with existing customers, the size of such transactions and sales to new customers. The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription, term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms. The timing of product revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and changes in contractual arrangements (e.g., subscription to term) with existing customers. Revenue and Revenue Mix We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into “platforms,” which are included in the various product groups described below. Our product groups are: Functional Verification: Products in this group, which include the Incisivetm functional verification platform, are used to verify that the high level, logical specification of an IC design is correct. The technology acquired from Verisity has been incorporated into the Incisive functional verification platform. Digital IC Design: Products in this group, which include the Encountertm digital IC design platform, are used to accurately convert the high-level, logical specification of a digital integrated circuit into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the integrated circuit will be physically implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture. Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, which include the Virtuoso® custom design platform, are used for integrated circuits that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, radio frequency, memories, high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries. Detailed design information showing how the integrated circuit will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture. Design for Manufacturing: Included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. System Interconnect: This product group consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro® system interconnect design platform, which enables consistent co-design of integrated circuits, IC packages and PCBs. 35 Table of Contents Revenue by Year The table below shows our revenue for the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 and the percentage change in revenue between those years: % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions) Product $ 851.5 $ 729.8 $ 663.5 17% 10% Services 126.2 137.0 131.2 (8)% 4% Maintenance 351.5 330.7 324.8 6% 2% Total revenue $ 1,329.2 $ 1,197.5 $ 1,119.5 11% 7% 2005 compared to 2004 Product revenue was higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital IC Design, Functional Verification and Custom IC products. Services revenue was lower in 2005, as compared to 2004, due to our reduced capacity to satisfy demand for our design services after having implemented certain restructuring activities. 2004 compared to 2003 Product revenue was higher in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital IC and System Interconnect products and sales of certain intellectual property. Services revenue increased in 2004 due to an increase in customer spending for design and methodology services as the electronics industry experienced some recovery from the economic downturn of 2002 and 2003. Revenue by Product Group The following table shows for 2005, 2004 and 2003 the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups, and Services and other: 2005 2004 2003 Functional Verification 21% 17% 19% Digital IC Design 28% 25% 23% Custom IC Design 25% 27% 27% Design for Manufacturing 9% 9% 10% System Interconnect 8% 9% 9% Services and other 9% 13% 12% Total 100% 100% 100% Revenue generated by products acquired with Verisity is included in the Functional Verification product group. During 2004, we recognized $11.0 million of revenue from the sale of intellectual property, or IP. This sale of IP is included in Services and other in the preceding table and in Product revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. 36 Table of Contents Revenue by Geography % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions) United States $ 613.2 $ 598.9 $ 623.7 2% (4)% Other North America 20.3 27.0 26.3 (25)% 3% Europe 245.0 261.9 187.9 (6)% 39% Japan 333.2 191.2 187.9 74% 2% Asia 117.5 118.5 93.7 (1)% 27% Total revenue $ 1,329.2 $ 1,197.5 $ 1,119.5 11% 7% Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue 2005 2004 2003 United States 46% 50% 56% Other North America 2% 2% 2% Europe 18% 22% 17% Japan 25% 16% 17% Asia 9% 10% 8% Total revenue 100% 100% 100% Both our domestic and international businesses have been affected by the revenue trends discussed above in this section entitled “Results of Operations.” The rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those regions. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to decrease by $5.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, and to increase by $16.0 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to fluctuations of the Japanese yen in relation to the United States dollar. Additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of Revenue % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions) Product $ 79.6 $ 82.0 $ 67.0 (3)% 22% Services 90.3 91.0 93.2 (1)% (2)% Maintenance 58.8 53.0 56.5 11% (6)% Cost of Revenue as a Percent of Related Revenue 2005 2004 2003 Product 9% 11% 10% Services 72% 66% 71% Maintenance 17% 16% 17% Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salaries and benefits, amortization 37 Table of Contents of intangible assets directly related to Cadence products, the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials, assembly labor and overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software product. A summary of Cost of product is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Product related costs $ 29.0 $ 38.0 $ 28.0 Amortization of acquired intangibles 50.6 44.0 39.0 Total Cost of product $ 79.6 $ 82.0 $ 67.0 2005 compared to 2004 Cost of product decreased $2.4 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a decrease of $13.5 million in the cost of hardware products sold as a result of sales of products with lower costs, partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangibles, a $1.6 million increase in royalty expenses and an increase in other individually insignificant items. Cost of product in the future will depend primarily upon the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period and the degree to which we license and incorporate third-party technology in our products licensed or sold in any given period. Cost of services primarily includes employee salary and benefit costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services decreased $0.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in other operating expenses, partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in salary and benefit costs. Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support, certain employees and documentation of maintenance updates. Cost of maintenance increased $5.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, due to a $3.1 million increase in amortization of intangible assets and a $2.2 million increase in salary and benefit costs. The remaining increase in cost of maintenance is due to other individually insignificant items. 2004 compared to 2003 Cost of product increased $15.0 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase of $18.0 million in cost of goods sold for our hardware business resulting from increased sales of our hardware products, and an increase of $5.0 million in amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in royalty expenses and a $3.6 million decrease in amortized software costs. Cost of services decreased $2.2 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a decrease in salary and benefit costs resulting from decreases in employees in our services business. Services gross margin as a percentage of services revenue increased during 2004, as compared to 2003, due to increased services revenues and decreased cost of services. Cost of maintenance decreased $3.5 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to a $2.3 million decrease in salary and benefit costs and a $1.2 million decrease in information technology, facilities and general operating expenses. 38 Table of Contents Operating Expenses % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions) Marketing and sales $ 356.0 $ 325.9 $ 326.6 9% 0% Research and development 370.1 351.3 340.1 5% 3% General and administrative 117.6 85.4 87.6 38% (2)% Total operating expenses $ 843.7 $ 762.6 $ 754.3 11% 1% Operating Expenses as a Percent of Total Revenue 2005 2004 2003 Marketing and sales 27% 27% 29% Research and development 28% 29% 30% General and administrative 9% 7% 8% Operating Expense Summary With the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, we expect our operating expenses to increase due to the expensing of the fair value of awards granted under our equity compensation plans. 2005 compared to 2004 Operating expenses increased $81.1 million during 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a $57.3 million increase in employee salary and benefit costs, primarily due to our acquisition of Verisity and increased bonus and commission costs, and an $8.6 million increase in losses associated with the sale of installment contract receivables. The increase in operating expenses was also due to executive severance costs and other individually insignificant items. These increases were partially offset by our restructuring activities, as discussed below. 2004 compared to 2003 Operating expenses increased $8.3 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $31.8 million increase in employee salary and benefit and related costs including bonuses earned in 2004 that had not been earned in 2003. This increase was partially offset by a $13.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, a $7.4 million decrease in outside services and a $7.2 million decrease in commission payments to Innotech as a result of our acquisition from Innotech in 2003 of distribution rights to certain of its customers. Foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by $10.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to the strengthening of the European Union euro, British pound and Japanese yen in relation to the United States dollar. Marketing and Sales 2005 compared to 2004 Marketing and sales expenses increased $30.1 million during 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a $27.9 million increase in employee salary, commission and benefit costs. The remaining increase in marketing and sales expense was due to other individually insignificant items, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in outside marketing program costs. 39 Table of Contents 2004 compared to 2003 Marketing and sales expenses decreased $0.7 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $7.2 million decrease in commission payments to Innotech as a result of our acquisition from Innotech of distribution rights to certain of its customers and a $3.1 million reduction in depreciation related to prior restructuring activities. This decrease was partially offset by a $7.7 million increase in employee salary and benefit and related costs and a $2.2 million increase in marketing program costs. Research and Development 2005 compared to 2004 Research and development expense increased $18.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a $22.4 million increase in employee salary and benefit costs, partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in depreciation expense. The increase in salary and benefit costs resulted primarily from the acquisition of Verisity and increased staffing to support product development. 2004 compared to 2003 Research and development expense increased $11.2 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $21.4 million increase in employee salary and benefit and related costs resulting from an increase in employees due to business acquisitions and increased staffing to support product development. This increase was partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in expenses related to our use of outside services and a $3.2 million decrease in costs associated with outsourced research and development projects. General and Administrative 2005 compared to 2004 General and administrative expense increased $32.2 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to an $8.6 million increase in losses on the sale of installment contract receivables, a $7.1 million increase in executive severance costs, a $6.5 million increase in employee salary and benefit costs and a $5.2 million increase in legal and consulting services. The remaining increase in general and administrative expense is due to other individually insignificant items, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in professional fees related to our annual audit and Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. 2004 compared to 2003 General and administrative expense decreased $2.2 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $3.0 million decrease in losses on the sale of installment contract receivables, a $2.6 million decrease in legal expense, a $2.4 million decrease in bad debt expense and a $1.3 million decrease in insurance expense, partially offset by a $4.5 million increase in employee salary, benefit and related costs and a $2.6 million increase in professional fees related to our annual audit and Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 47.8 $ 55.7 $ 62.6 We expect Amortization of acquired intangibles to significantly decrease in 2006 due to the completed amortization of certain existing intangible assets during 2005. 2005 compared to 2004 Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $7.9 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a $21.0 million decrease in the amortization of acquired intangibles reflecting the full amortization of 40 Table of Contents intangible assets from prior year acquisitions, partially offset by increases of $13.1 million in amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2004. 2004 compared to 2003 Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $6.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to an $11.4 million decrease in the amortization of acquired intangibles reflecting the full amortization of intangible assets from prior year acquisitions, partially offset by increases of $5.6 million in amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with acquisitions completed in 2004 and 2003. Deferred Compensation 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Deferred compensation $ 45.3 $ 26.4 $ 47.7 We amortize deferred stock compensation related to fixed awards using the straight-line method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock vest. We recognize stock compensation expense related to variable awards using an accelerated method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock are earned. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, we expect deferred compensation to decrease as the related equity compensation expense will be reflected throughout our other operating expenses. 2005 compared to 2004 Deferred compensation increased $18.9 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, due to a $10.4 million increase in deferred compensation related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and a $9.1 million increase in deferred stock compensation primarily related to incentive stock grants. 2004 compared to 2003 Deferred stock compensation decreased $21.3 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to a $24.6 million decrease in deferred stock compensation primarily related to our previously completed acquisitions and an $11.6 million decrease in deferred compensation expense related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. This decrease was partially offset by a $14.9 million increase in deferred stock compensation primarily related to incentive stock grants. Restructuring and Other Charges We have initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year since 2001 in an effort to reduce operating expenses and improve operating margins and cash flows. The restructuring plans initiated each year from 2001 through 2004, or the 2001 Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring, 2003 Restructuring and 2004 Restructuring, respectively, were intended to decrease costs through workforce reductions and facility and resource consolidation, in order to improve our cost structure. The 2001 and 2002 Restructurings primarily related to our design services business and certain other business or infrastructure groups throughout the world. The 2003 and 2004 Restructurings were targeted at reducing costs throughout the company. During 2005, we implemented a new plan of restructuring, or the 2005 Restructuring, in an effort to decrease costs by reducing workforce and consolidating facilities throughout the company. During 2005, in conjunction with the workforce reduction involving our European design services business, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction involving land and a building in Livingston, Scotland. Proceeds from the sale were $33.6 million and the total gain on the sale was $3.6 million. We have agreed to lease back a portion of the facility for the next two years and another portion for ten years, with an option to 41 Table of Contents terminate the ten year lease at five years. We have deferred the gain on the sale and will recognize the gain ratably over the maximum remaining lease term of ten years. A summary of restructuring and other charges by plan of restructuring for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: Severance and Asset- Excess Benefits Related Facilities Other Total (In millions) 2005: 2005 Plan $ 20.8 $ 2.4 $ 2.4 $ — $ 25.6 2004 Plan (0.4 ) — — — (0.4 ) 2003 Plan — — 4.8 — 4.8 2002 Plan — — (0.4 ) — (0.4 ) 2001 Plan — — 5.7 — 5.7 Total 2005 $ 20.4 $ 2.4 $ 12.5 $ — $ 35.3 2004: 2004 Plan $ 7.0 $ 0.2 $ — $ 9.4 $ 16.6 2003 Plan (0.8 ) (2.8 ) 1.5 — (2.1 ) 2002 Plan (0.5 ) (1.2 ) 0.1 — (1.6 ) 2001 Plan — — 0.6 — 0.6 Total 2004 $ 5.7 $ (3.8 ) $ 2.2 $ 9.4 $ 13.5 2003: 2003 Plan $ 25.7 $ 25.7 $ 10.9 $ — $ 62.3 2002 Plan 0.8 0.4 1.5 — 2.7 2001 Plan — — 1.8 — 1.8 Total 2003 $ 26.5 $ 26.1 $ 14.2 $ — $ 66.8 Frequently, asset impairments are based on significant estimates and assumptions, particularly regarding remaining useful life and utilization rates. We may incur other charges in the future if management determines that the useful life or utilization of certain long-lived assets has been reduced. Facility closure and office space reduction costs include payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs, and other contractual charges. To determine the lease loss, which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing all or part of a building, certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms, including sublease rates and contractual common area charges. As of December 31, 2005, our estimate of the accrued lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring activities initiated since 2001 was $34.8 million. This amount will be adjusted in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. The lease loss could range as high as $38.8 million if sublease rental rates decrease in applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities. Since 2001, we have recorded facilities consolidation charges under the 2001 through 2005 Restructurings of $97.7 million related to reducing space in or the closing of 49 sites, of which 28 have been vacated and 21 have been downsized. We expect to pay all of the facilities-related restructuring liabilities for all our restructuring plans prior to 2016. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring activities may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any 42 Table of Contents degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. The following is further discussion of the activity under each restructuring plan: 2005 Restructuring — During the year ended December 31, 2005, we reduced our workforce by approximately 300 employees, including approximately 65 employees in our European design services business, and consolidated facilities and resources throughout the company. Costs resulting from the 2005 Restructuring included severance payments, severance-related benefits, outplacement services, lease costs associated with facilities vacated and downsized, and charges for assets written-off as a result of the restructuring. Severance and benefits expenses associated with the 2005 Restructuring were approximately $20.8 million. All terminations and termination benefits associated with the workforce reductions under the 2005 Restructuring were communicated to the affected employees prior to December 31, 2005, with substantially all termination benefits paid prior to December 31, 2005. The remaining termination benefits are expected to be paid by April 1, 2006. Asset-related and other charges of $2.4 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2005 are comprised of $1.5 million of expenses from the restructuring activities, primarily related to the write-off of leasehold improvements for facilities vacated and downsized, and $0.9 million of other charges related to the disposal of other assets not associated with our restructuring activities. Facilities-related expenses of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 are comprised of $1.8 million of expenses for facilities vacated or consolidated and $0.6 million related to changes in lease loss estimates for vacated and downsized facilities. Facilities-related expenses include payments required under leases, net of estimated sublease income, lease buyout costs and other contractual charges. We expect total ongoing annual savings of approximately $38.3 million related to the actions of the 2005 Restructuring. We also expect to incur an additional $1.0 million to $2.0 million of future costs in connection with the 2005 Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges, which will be expensed as incurred. The actual amount of additional costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities. 2004 Restructuring — We recorded a net credit of $0.3 million during 2005, which relates to reversing the portion of the severance and other benefits accrual in excess of the remaining expected obligation. 2003 Restructuring — During 2005, we recorded additional expense of $4.8 million, related primarily to changes in estimated sublease income from vacated and downsized facilities. Cadence also paid approximately $3.5 million of fees related to headcount reductions at a foreign facility. The liability associated with this payment was recorded prior to the year ended December 31, 2005. We expect to incur an additional $3.0 million to $5.0 million of future costs in connection with the 2003 Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges, which will be expensed as incurred. The actual amount of additional costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities. 2002 Restructuring — During 2005, we recorded a net credit of $0.4 million related to changes in lease loss estimates for facilities included in the 2002 Restructuring. 2001 Restructuring — During 2005, we recorded additional expense of $5.7 million related to a change in the lease loss estimate for a facility included in the 2001 Restructuring. Write-off of Acquired In-Process Research and Development Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to expense any acquired in-process research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired in-process research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established. The values are determined by 43 Table of Contents estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process research and development. Described below are the write-offs of acquired in-process research and development charges in 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Verisity Ltd. $ 9.4 $ — $ — Neolinear, Inc. — 7.0 — Get2Chip.com, Inc. — — 3.8 Verplex Systems, Inc. — — 2.0 Celestry Design Technologies, Inc. — — 1.7 Other 2004 acquisition — 2.0 — Total in process technology $ 9.4 $ 9.0 $ 7.5 Described below is a summary of in-process research and development acquired during 2005, 2004 and 2003 as of December 31, 2005: Estimated Expenditures Remaining Incurred to Expenditures Complete to Complete In-Process In-Process Research Research Discount Commercial and and Rates Feasibility Development Development (In millions) Verisity Inc. 19% to 32% February 2007 $ 2.7 $ 1.7 Neolinear, Inc. 28% December 2004 7.2 — Other 2004 acquisition 30% December 2004 0.8 — Get2Chip.com, Inc. 30% June 2005 6.5 — Verplex Systems, Inc. 30% November 2004 2.6 — Simplex Solutions, Inc. 30% April 2003 4.2 — Celestry Design Technologies, Inc. 35% March 2003 2.0 — Total Expenditures $ 26.0 $ 1.7 Interest Expense 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Interest expense $ 5.4 $ 6.2 $ 5.0 We expect interest expense to increase during 2006 due to the $160.0 million term loan entered into by our Irish subsidiary, Castlewilder, in December 2005. 2005 compared to 2004 Interest expense decreased $0.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to a decrease of $0.6 million in imputed interest on acquisition-related payments which occur over time. The remaining decrease of $0.2 million is due to other individually insignificant items. 44 Table of Contents 2004 compared to 2003 Interest expense increased $1.2 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million in amortization expense related to the costs associated with the issuance of our Notes in August 2003, an increase of $1.3 million in imputed interest on acquisition-related payments which occur over time, partially offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in interest expense related to our 2002 credit facilities that were terminated in 2003 after the issuance of the Notes. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, for the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Interest income $ 15.6 $ 5.6 $ 3.4 Gain (loss) on foreign exchange 4.5 (1.4 ) 2.3 Gain on sale of investments 11.7 12.4 — Write-down of investments (10.9 ) (4.2 ) (4.8 ) Equity loss from investments (6.5 ) (16.9 ) (10.9 ) Telos management fees (2.4 ) (2.5 ) (2.5 ) Telos termination fees (2.6 ) — — Gains (losses) on non-qualified deferred compensation assets 6.6 (5.0 ) 6.5 Other income (expense) (0.9 ) 0.5 2.0 Total other income (expense), net $ 15.1 $ (11.5 ) $ (4.0 ) Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in millions) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 79.1 $ 12.0 $ (13.0 ) Effective tax rate 62% 14% 43% 2005 compared to 2004 The effective tax rate in 2005 increased from that in 2004 primarily due to $30.1 million of federal, state and foreign income taxes incurred upon our repatriation of $500.0 million of certain foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act, or AJCA, and an increase in foreign income tax expense from operations. 2004 compared to 2003 The income before provision for income taxes resulted in a provision for income taxes in 2004 compared to a benefit for income taxes in 2003. The 2004 provision for income taxes has a greater benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower rate than the United States Federal statutory rate when compared to 2003. Outlook for 2006 We are currently projecting the effective income tax rate for 2006 to be approximately 40%. The decrease in the effective income tax rate as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the non-recurring income taxes related to the 2005 repatriation of certain foreign earnings. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, we may have additional volatility in our effective income tax rate due to certain stock-based compensation for which we are not allowed to anticipate a tax deduction. The tax deduction will be recognized in the period of the taxable event. 45 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005, we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately $148.3 million. Realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however, could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts, including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from those estimated. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed our evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the AJCA, which created a temporary one year incentive for United States corporations to repatriate accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends. We made the determination to repatriate $500 million of certain foreign earnings which were previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. We will invest these earnings in the United States pursuant to the AJCA guidelines. We completed the repatriation and we recorded an income tax expense of $30.1 million associated with the repatriation during the fourth quarter of 2005. In the future, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside of the United States. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or the RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million, plus interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four and nine percent since 1997. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have protested certain of the proposed adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS where the matter is presently being considered. The most significant of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. The IRS may also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999. The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and may challenge the tax reported on these tax returns. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we have assessed the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations, including the current IRS examination and the IRS RAR for tax years 1997 through 1999. We provide for tax liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets unless we consider it probable that additional taxes will not be due. However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues. In addition, we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination, we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the period or periods recorded. Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio and the term loan entered into by our Irish subsidiary, Castlewilder. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and costs associated with foreign currency hedges and interest paid on the Castlewilder term loan. 46 Table of Contents We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. The table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with maturities between three and 12 months are considered to be short-term investments. Investments with maturities greater than 12 months are considered long-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value at December 31, 2005. Carrying Average Value Interest Rate (In millions) Interest-Bearing Instruments: Commercial Paper — fixed rate $ 710.6 4.39% Cash — variable rate 66.4 1.87% Cash equivalents — variable rate 26.1 3.84% Cash equivalents — fixed rate 23.8 0.83% US Agency Discount Notes — fixed rate 20.0 3.82% Total interest-bearing instruments $ 846.9 4.06% In connection with the Castlewilder term loan, we manage interest rate risk by having the option to choose between two interest rates: (i) a base rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus a spread of 0.50% or the “prime rate” publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A., or (ii) a LIBOR-based rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 0.625%. The loan was initially a base rate loan that converted on December 22, 2005 into a LIBOR-based rate loan, which accrued interest monthly at a rate of 4.995% as of December 31, 2005. We can change our interest rate election each Interest Period, as defined in the loan agreement. The margin with respect to the loan (if the loan is a LIBOR loan) may be increased or decreased depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio. Foreign Currency Risk Our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening United States dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other assets. 47 Table of Contents Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 180 days or less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures. The table below provides information, as of December 31, 2005, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts mature prior to March 17, 2006. Weighted Average Notional Contract Principal Rate (In millions) Forward Contracts: Japanese yen $ 75.9 118.46 British pound sterling 43.0 0.57 European Union euro 8.9 0.84 Hong Kong dollars 3.9 7.75 Singapore dollars 2.1 1.67 $ 133.8 Estimated fair value $ 0.4 While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Equity Price Risk In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of the Notes to two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $406.4 million after transaction fees of approximately $13.6 million. The Notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The Notes do not contain restrictive financial covenants. Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will initially be convertible into 63.8790 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to maturity only if: (1) the price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during certain periods of time specified in the Notes, (2) specified corporate transactions occur, (3) the Notes have been called for redemption or (4) the trading price of the Notes falls below a certain threshold. In addition, in the event of a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for 100.00% of the principal amount. 48 Table of Contents Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with JP Morgan Chase Bank, whereby we have options to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately $134.6 million. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of the options acquired in the convertible notes hedge transactions was $130.8 million. In addition, we sold to JP Morgan Chase Bank warrants to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of the sold warrants was $29.6 million. For additional discussion of the Notes see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. Our equity investments primarily are made in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. The fair value of our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable equity securities, which are included in Short-term investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, was $33.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and $35.9 million as of January 1, 2005. While we actively monitor these investments, we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $37.9 million as of December 31, 2005 and $45.7 million as of January 1, 2005. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists for a non-marketable equity security, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write-down as an investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of and for the years ended December 31, % January 1, % January 3, 2005 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In millions, except percentages) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 894.6 51% $ 593.0 42% $ 418.4 Net working capital $ 670.5 29% $ 521.0 45% $ 360.3 Cash provided by operating activities $ 426.3 14% $ 372.5 118% $ 171.0 Cash used for investing activities $ (222.7 ) 4% $ (215.0 ) (44)% $ (386.3 ) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 205.3 (1073)% $ (21.1 ) (114)% $ 149.2 49 Table of Contents Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments As of December 31, 2005, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $894.6 million of Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $593.0 million as of January 1, 2005 and $418.4 million as of January 3, 2004. The primary sources of our cash in 2005 and 2004 were customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or lease of our hardware products, payments for the provision of design and methodology services, a term loan facility, proceeds from the sale of receivables and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans. Our primary uses of cash in 2005 and 2004 consisted of payments relating to payroll, product, services and other operating expenses, taxes, purchases of treasury stock and business acquisitions. Net working capital Net working capital increased $149.5 million as of December 31, 2005, as compared to January 1, 2005, primarily due to the increase in Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $301.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in Accounts receivable, net, of $102.0 million, an increase of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $22.6 million and an increase in Current portion of long-term debt of $32.0 million. Net working capital increased $160.7 million as of January 1, 2005, as compared to January 3, 2004, primarily due to the increase in Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $174.6 million, an increase in Receivables, net, of $35.4 million, and an increase in Prepaid expense and other of $14.1 million, partially offset by an increase of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $34.5 million and an increase in Deferred revenue of $32.5 million. Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities are provided by net income, adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the balance of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of receivables. We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a non-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During 2005, we transferred accounts receivable totaling $192.1 million, which approximated fair value, to financing institutions on a non-recourse basis, as compared to $30.1 million in 2004 and $87.4 million in 2003. Provision for sales returns is accounted for as a reduction of revenue. Provision for sales returns decreased by $0.5 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, and decreased $7.0 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. 2005 compared to 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $53.8 million, during 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in Proceeds from the sale of receivables of $162.0 million and a decrease in payments associated with Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $18.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income of $25.1 million, a net decrease in cash received from collection of Receivables and Installment contract receivables of $71.9 million and a change in Other assets of $14.8 million. 2004 compared to 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $201.5 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase in net income of $92.0 million, an increase in cash received from Installment contract receivables of $128.5 million, a decrease in payments associated with Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $108.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in Proceeds from the sale of receivables of $57.3 million and a decrease of cash collected on Accounts receivable, net, of $48.0 million. 50 Table of Contents Cash flows from investing activities Our primary investing activities consisted of purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, purchases and proceeds from short-term investments, acquiring businesses and investing in venture capital partnerships and equity investments. As part of our overall investment strategy, we have limited partnership interests in three venture capital funds, Telos Venture Partners, L.P., or Telos I, Telos Venture Partners II, L.P., or Telos II, and Telos Venture Partners III, L.P., or Telos III (Telos I, Telos II and Telos III are referred to collectively as Telos). We and certain of our deferred compensation trusts hold the entire limited partnership interests in Telos I and Telos III, and we hold the entire limited partnership interest in Telos II. The Telos II general partner, which is not affiliated with us, manages Telos II. The contractual term of Telos I ended on December 31, 2005 and Telos I is currently being liquidated. In December 2005, we notified the general partner of Telos II of our intent to dissolve the partnership effective December 31, 2006. We also determined to liquidate Telos III and removed the general partner of Telos III effective December 31, 2005. The new general partner, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, will complete the liquidation of Telos III. The partnership agreement governing Telos II requires us to meet capital calls principally for the purpose of funding investments that are recommended by the general partner and approved by the Telos advisory committee as being consistent with the partnership’s limitations and stated purpose. For all three partnerships, the Telos advisory committee is comprised solely of the members of the Venture Committee of our Board of Directors, the current members of which are three independent members of our Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2005, we had contributed $123.8 million to these partnerships and are contractually committed to contribute up to an additional $4.3 million to Telos II through December 31, 2006. Actual future contributions will depend upon the level of investments made by Telos II. Our investments in the Telos partnerships are recorded in Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held by us and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust through Telos I, was acquired for consideration of $6.53 per common share. Under the purchase agreement, 10% of the consideration is held in escrow to pay unresolved claims against KhiMetrics, Inc. through the first anniversary of the acquisition, at which time the remaining escrow will be distributed to the former stockholders of KhiMetrics. In connection with this sale, Cadence received approximately $17.5 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately $14.4 million in January 2006. 2005 compared to 2004 Net cash used for investing activities increased by $7.7 million during 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase of $182.0 in Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by an increase in Proceeds from sale of short-term investments, net of Purchases of short-term investments of $141.2 million and an increase in Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $30.0 million. 2004 compared to 2003 Net cash used for investing activities decreased by $171.3 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a decrease of $67.1 million of net Cash paid in business acquisitions, a decrease of $17.0 million of investments in venture capital partnership and equity investments, a decrease of $29.3 million in Purchases of technology, a decrease of $21.1 million in Purchases of property, plant and equipment, an increase of $98.6 million of Sales of short-term investments and an increase of Proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities and long-term investments of $14.9 million, partially offset by an increase of $71.2 million of Purchases of short-term investments. 51 Table of Contents During 2003, we received $9.1 million in cash from the sale-leaseback of certain equipment. We will make aggregate payments under the resulting operating leases of $9.1 million over the three to five year life of the operating leases. Cash flows from financing activities Financing cash flows consisted primarily of a term loan in 2005 and a convertible note financing in 2003, the repurchase of treasury stock and the issuance of stock under certain employee plans and the cash impact of certain hedge transactions related to the convertible note financing. 2005 compared to 2004 Net cash provided by financing activities was $205.3 million, as compared to net cash used for financing activities of $21.1 million in 2004, a change of $226.4 million. In 2005, our primary use of cash from financing activities was the repurchase of $101.1 million of treasury stock, as compared to $94.1 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining repurchase authorization under our stock repurchase program totaled $21.9 million. In 2005, our primary source of cash from financing activities was $146.5 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and under our employee stock purchase program, as compared to $75.3 million in 2004. In addition during 2005, our wholly-owned Irish subsidiary, Castlewilder, borrowed $160.0 million to declare a cash dividend to Cadence under the AJCA. 2004 compared to 2003 Net cash used for financing activities was $21.1 million in 2004, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $149.2 million in 2003, a change of $162.5 million. In 2004, our primary use of cash from financing activities was the repurchase of $94.1 million of treasury stock, as compared to $213.8 million in 2003. As of January 1, 2005, the remaining repurchase authorization under our stock repurchase program totaled $123.0 million. Our primary source of cash from financing activities was $75.3 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and under our employee stock purchase program, as compared to $86.6 million in 2003. In addition during 2003, we issued $420.0 million of convertible notes and received proceeds from the sale of common stock warrants and purchased convertible notes hedges of $134.6 million. We expect to continue our financing activities and may use cash reserves to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program. We may also consider additional hedging transactions if opportunities become available. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources We provide for United States income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered permanently invested outside of the United States. At December 31, 2005, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $196.0 million. At December 31, 2005, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $64.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed our evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the AJCA, which created a temporary one year incentive for United States corporations to repatriate accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends. We made the determination to repatriate $500 million of certain foreign earnings which were previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. We will invest these earnings in the United States pursuant to the AJCA guidelines. We expect that we will pay $24.5 million of federal and state income taxes related to the repatriation during the first quarter of 2006. In the future, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside of the United States. We received an RAR from the IRS in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the tax years 1997 through 1999 of approximately $143.0 million, plus interest, which interest will accrue until 52 Table of Contents the matter is resolved. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have filed a protest with the IRS to certain of the proposed adjustments. We are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously. While we are protesting certain of the proposed adjustments, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of the tax examination, including the amount payable, or timing of such payments, which may materially impact our cash flows in the period or periods resolved. The IRS may also make similar claims for tax returns filed for years subsequent to 1999. The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and may challenge the tax reported on these tax returns. During 2005, we recorded Restructuring and other charges of $35.3 million and made $33.5 million of cash payments related to all of our restructuring activities. We expect to incur an additional $4.0 million to $7.0 million of future costs in connection with our restructuring activities in subsequent periods, primarily for facilities-related charges in connection with the 2003 and 2005 Restructurings, which amounts will be expensed as incurred. In December 2005, our Irish subsidiary, Castlewilder, entered into a syndicated term facility agreement, or Credit Agreement, with Banc of America Securities LLC as lead arranger, Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a three-year $160 million unsecured term loan. With the consent of all of the lenders, we may, at the end of the second year of the loan, extend the maturity date to December 31, 2009. Castlewilder’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and Cadence Technology Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Castlewilder. Our guaranty contains certain financial covenants that must be maintained by us on a consolidated basis, as well as limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, make investments, dispose of assets, pay dividends or other distributions, engage in certain corporate transactions and certain other activities. During the term of the Credit Agreement, we have the option to choose between two interest rates: (i) a base rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus a spread of 0.50% or the “prime rate” publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A., or (ii) a LIBOR-based rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 0.625%. The loan was initially a base rate loan that converted on December 22, 2005 into a LIBOR-based rate loan, which accrued interest monthly at a rate of 4.995% as of December 31, 2005. We can change our interest rate election each Interest Period, as defined in the loan agreement. The margin with respect to the loan (if the loan is a LIBOR loan) may be increased or decreased depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio. Through Castlewilder, we are obligated to repay the outstanding principal amount of the loan in quarterly installments in amounts equal to $8.0 million per quarter during 2006, $12.0 million per quarter during 2007 and $20.0 million per quarter during 2008 (with the quarterly repayment amount to be adjusted to $10.0 million per quarter during 2008 and 2009 if the maturity date of the loan is extended). We are also obligated to pay accrued interest on the last day of each month or other interest period that we may select under the terms of the Credit Agreement. If the loan is converted into a base rate loan, we are obligated to pay accrued interest on the last day of each quarter. In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, or the Notes, to two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of approximately $406.4 million, after transaction fees of approximately $13.6 million that were recorded in Other assets and are being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over five years, which is the duration of the first redemption period. We issued the Notes at par and the Notes bear no interest. The Notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. The holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount, by providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice. The repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase date. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal 53 Table of Contents amount, except for those Notes that holders have required us to repurchase on August 15, 2008 or on other repurchase dates, as described above. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions whereby we have options to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately $134.6 million. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of the options acquired in the convertible notes hedge transactions was $130.8 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of the sold warrants was $29.6 million. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Operating lease obligations $ 145.9 $ 31.1 $ 51.2 $ 23.9 $ 39.7 Purchase obligations 4.6 3.2 1.4 — — Term loan 160.0 32.0 128.0 — — Convertible notes 420.0 — 420.0 — — Venture capital partnership commitments 4.3 4.3 — — — Other long-term contractual obligations 269.9 — 234.7 31.7 3.5 Total $ 1,004.7 $ 70.6 $ 835.3 $ 55.6 $ 43.2 The primary components of Other long-term contractual obligations of $269.9 million related to indemnity holdbacks from acquisitions, income tax liabilities and deferred income tax liabilities. In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $27.0 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional $7.0 million in cash during the three years following the next 12 months if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following are achieved in full: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product development and employee retention. We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2005, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. New Accounting Standards In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years 54 Table of Contents beginning after December 15, 2005; however, SFAS No. 154 does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. In March 2005, the FASB published FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,” which clarifies that the term, “conditional asset retirement obligation,” as used in SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. The interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This interpretation was adopted effective December 31, 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payments,” which eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under APB No. 25 and requires the measurement of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 123R in our first quarter of fiscal 2006. SFAS No. 123R will result in the recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans. As noted in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we generally do not recognize any compensation expense related to stock option grants issued under our stock option plans or related to the discounts provided under our employee stock purchase plans. Under the new rules, we will be required to adopt a fair-value-based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards. The resulting additional compensation expense will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. We will recognize stock-based compensation expense on all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Asset,” an amendment of APB No. 29. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 is effective for us for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the first quarter of 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A.

We license software, sell or lease hardware technology, provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide design, methodology and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics product development processes. Our broad range of products and services are used by the world’s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and electronics systems. With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation steps. We combine our design technologies into “platforms” addressing four major design activities: functional verification, digital IC design, custom IC design and system interconnect design. The four Cadence design platforms are Incisive functional verification, Encounter digital IC design, Virtuoso custom design and Allegro system interconnect design platforms. In addition, we augment these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of DFM products that service both the digital and custom IC design flows. These four platforms, together with our DFM products, comprise our primary product lines. Digital implementation was the fastest growing product group in 2007 in terms of revenue, driven by the focus on complex chips, advanced nodes and low power. Design challenges at the 65 nanometer and 45 nanometer process nodes drove upgrades in the digital, custom and DFM product groups. Also during 2007, the Allegro system interconnect design platform had a complete technology update and the custom simulation business had a significant product update. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items more fully below under the heading “Results of Operations” below. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes and valuation of stock-based awards have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue recognition We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9, “Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,” to all software licensing transactions and to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental. We also apply the provisions of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists. We license software using three different license types: • Subscription licenses; • Term licenses; and • Perpetual licenses. For many of our term and subscription license arrangements, we use our proprietary internet-based delivery mechanism, “eDA-on-tap,” to facilitate the delivery of our software products. To maximize the efficiency of this 29 Table of Contents delivery mechanism, we created what we refer to as “eDA Cards,” of which there are two types. Subscription license customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eDA Platinum Card,” which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and the ability to use additional unspecified software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement. Term license customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eDA Gold Card,” which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement. Overall, the eDA Cards provide greater flexibility for our customers in how and when they deploy and use our software products. Subscription licenses – Our subscription license arrangements offer our customers the right to: • Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement, generally two to four years, with no rights to return; • Use unspecified additional software products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement; and • Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other unspecified additional software products that may become available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software because all software products have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to use them. Customers that purchase an eDA Platinum Card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement, and to use other unspecified additional software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement, until the fees have been depleted. In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product. Subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance that was established in connection with the sale of our term licenses. In the event that a subscription license arrangement is terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or subsequent to the termination of the subscription license arrangement, the revenue associated with the new term license arrangement is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, assuming all other criteria in SOP 97-2 have been met. Term licenses – Our term license arrangements offer our customers the right to: • Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement, generally two to four years, with no rights to return; and • Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software because all software products have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to use them. Customers that purchase an eDA Gold Card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement until the fees relating to the arrangement have been depleted. In general, revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product. Perpetual licenses – Our perpetual licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software. In general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product. 30 Table of Contents Persuasive evidence of an arrangement – Generally, we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does not exist, we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service projects, such as training classes and small methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other service engagements, we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement. Sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Product delivery – Software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of free-on-board, or F.O.B., shipping point. Our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point. For customers who purchase eDA Gold or eDA Platinum Cards, delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant to the terms of the software license agreement. Fee is fixed or determinable – We assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. We have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments, products or services. For our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment, we only consider that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. We have a history of collecting receivables under installment contracts of up to five years. Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable. We must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Collection is probable – We assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the customer’s payment history and its current creditworthiness. We have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement, particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value – Our VSOE for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or 31 Table of Contents more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered. Our experience has been that we are able to determine VSOE for maintenance and time-based services, but not for product. Finance fee revenue – Finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees are recognized using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented approximately 2% of total revenue for each of the years ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Upon the sale of an installment contract, we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract. Services revenue – Services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing design and methodology services. These services are not related to the functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. Accounting for income taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” and FIN No. 48. Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns prior to actually preparing and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources, including tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused. Actual operating results or other events that cause us to change our expectations of the amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus materially affecting our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Under FIN No. 48, we may only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is “more likely than not” to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret the application of complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations, and practices. If an income tax position meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. To determine if a tax position is effectively settled, we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination had otherwise been completed. We must also determine when it is 32 Table of Contents reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each reporting date. These judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements that are based on the requirements of FIN No. 48. We must re-evaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Valuation of stock-based awards We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” Under SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the following: • Expected volatility of our stock; • Expected term of stock options; • Risk-free interest rate for the period; • Expected dividends, if any; and • Expected forfeitures. The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes pricing model for option grants is based on implied volatility calculated using the volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock. We use this approach to determine volatility because: • Options for our common stock are actively traded; • The market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee stock options; • The traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee stock options; and • The remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year. When establishing the expected life assumption, we review annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to option grants having similar vesting periods. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that we expect to be forfeited. We calculate a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock options and restricted stock issuances based on historical trends. The valuation of all options and the expected forfeiture rates for options and restricted stock are calculated based on one employee pool as there is no significant difference in exercise behavior between classes of employees. Of the $101.4 million of stock-based compensation expense recorded during 2007, we used the current year valuation assumptions described above for $17.8 million of our 2007 stock-based compensation expense for options granted during 2007, and we used prior year valuation assumptions for $31.2 million of our 2007 stock-based compensation expense for options granted prior to 2007. In addition, we expensed $42.8 million in 2007 related to restricted stock and $9.6 million related to the performance-based bonus plan described below. Judgment is also required to estimate the attainment of certain predetermined performance goals for a performance-based bonus plan under which payments may be made in our common stock. Each period, we estimate the most likely outcome of such performance goals and recognize any related stock-based compensation expense. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or estimated attainment of the various performance goals. If such performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected. Results of Operations We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design and methodology services. We 33 Table of Contents principally utilize three license types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types provide a customer with different terms of use for our products, such as: • The right to access new technology; • The duration of the license; and • Payment terms. Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed term of use, this will result in either a subscription or term license. A business implication of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups, rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license. See the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates” above for an additional description of license types and timing of revenue recognition. Although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period, we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the competitiveness of our new technology, the length of our sales cycle, and the size, duration, terms, type and timing of our: • Contract renewals with existing customers; • Additional sales to existing customers; and • Sales to new customers. A substantial portion of our total revenue is recognized over multiple periods. However, a significant portion of our product revenue is recognized upon delivery of licensed software, which generally occurs upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product. The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription, term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms. The timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements with existing customers (e.g., customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements to term license arrangements). Revenue and Revenue Mix We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into “platforms,” which are included in the various product groups described below. Our product groups are: Functional Verification: Products in this group, which include the Incisive functional verification platform, are used to verify that the high level, logical representation of an IC design is functionally correct. Digital IC Design: Products in this group, which include the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to accurately convert the high-level, logical representation of a digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the IC will be physically implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture. Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, which include the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for ICs that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, radio frequency, memories, high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries. Detailed design information showing how an IC will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture. System Interconnect Design: This product group consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro and OrCAD products. The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co-design of interconnects across ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions. 34 Table of Contents Design for Manufacturing: Included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. Revenue by Year The following table shows our revenue for the fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 and the percentage change in revenue between years: % Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (In millions) Product $ 1,104.0 $ 982.7 $ 851.5 12% 15% Services 125.8 134.9 126.2 (7)% 7% Maintenance 385.2 366.3 351.5 5% 4% Total revenue $ 1,615.0 $ 1,483.9 $ 1,329.2 9% 12% 2007 compared to 2006 Product revenue was higher in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital IC Design, Functional Verification and Custom IC Design products, partially offset by a small decrease in revenue from licenses for DFM products. Digital IC Design was the fastest growing platform in 2007. 2006 compared to 2005 Product revenue was higher in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Functional Verification and Custom IC Design products, partially offset by a small decrease in revenue from licenses for DFM products. Functional verification was the fastest growing platform in 2006. Revenue by Product Group The following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups, and Services and other in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005: 2007 2006 2005 Functional Verification 24% 24% 21% Digital IC Design 27% 24% 28% Custom IC Design 27% 27% 25% System Interconnect Design 8% 9% 8% Design for Manufacturing 6% 7% 9% Services and other 8% 9% 9% Total 100% 100% 100% As described under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates” above, certain of our licenses allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have licensed a combination of our products to customers with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the above table would differ. Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement. 35 Table of Contents Revenue by Geography % Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (In millions) United States $ 741.9 $ 765.1 $ 613.2 (3)% 25% Other Americas 34.8 31.3 20.3 11% 54% Europe, Middle East and Africa 296.9 284.4 245.0 4% 16% Japan 342.6 247.9 333.2 38% (26)% Asia 198.8 155.2 117.5 28% 32% Total revenue $ 1,615.0 $ 1,483.9 $ 1,329.2 9% 12% Revenue by Geography as a Percentage of Total Revenue 2007 2006 2005 United States 46% 52% 46% Other Americas 2% 2% 2% Europe, Middle East and Africa 19% 19% 18% Japan 21% 17% 25% Asia 12% 10% 9% The rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those regions. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2007, 2006 or 2005. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by $2.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the European Union euro and the British pound, partially offset by an increase in the valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to decrease $12.0 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in the valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen. Additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock-based Compensation Expense Summary Stock-based compensation expense is reflected throughout our costs and expenses in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Cost of product $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ ---- Cost of services 3.9 4.0 0.6 Cost of maintenance 2.5 2.5 0.4 Marketing and sales 22.2 23.9 9.1 Research and development 46.3 50.9 19.3 General and administrative 26.3 22.5 10.5 Total $ 101.4 $ 104.0 $ 39.9 36 Table of Contents Cost of Revenue % Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (In millions) Product $ 60.1 $ 66.8 $ 79.7 (10)% (16)% Services 93.4 96.5 91.9 (3)% 5% Maintenance 61.1 63.8 59.8 (4)% 7% Cost of Revenue as a Percentage of Related Revenue 2007 2006 2005 Product 5% 7% 9% Services 74% 72% 73% Maintenance 16% 17% 17% Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to Cadence products, the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials, assembly and overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software product. A summary of Cost of product in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Product related costs $ 37.8 $ 33.6 $ 32.7 Amortization of acquired intangibles 22.3 33.2 47.0 Total Cost of product $ 60.1 $ 66.8 $ 79.7 2007 compared to 2006 Cost of product decreased $6.7 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to: • A decrease of $10.9 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized during the period; partially offset by • An increase of $5.0 million in hardware costs attributable to increased hardware sales. 2006 compared to 2005 Cost of product decreased $12.9 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • A decrease of $13.8 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized during the period; partially offset by • An increase of $5.3 million in hardware costs attributable to increased hardware sales. Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period. Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. There were no material fluctuations in these components of Cost of services during 2007, as compared to 2006, or during 2006, as compared to 2005. Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, and documentation of maintenance updates. There were no 37 Table of Contents material fluctuations in these components of Cost of maintenance during 2007, as compared to 2006, or during 2006, as compared to 2005. Operating Expenses % Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (In millions) Marketing and sales $ 407.1 $ 405.6 $ 366.2 0% 11% Research and development 494.0 460.1 390.7 7% 18% General and administrative 169.0 143.3 129.6 18% 11% Total operating expenses $ 1,070.1 $ 1,009.0 $ 886.5 6% 14% Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Total Revenue 2007 2006 2005 Marketing and sales 25% 27% 28% Research and development 31% 31% 29% General and administrative 10% 10% 10% Operating Expense Summary 2007 compared to 2006 Operating expenses increased $61.1 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to: • An increase of $55.1 million in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, primarily due to an increased number of employees and increases in salary costs; and • An increase of $18.4 million in litigation (see discussion under the heading “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings” above), legal and other professional services costs; partially offset by • A decrease of $10.9 million due to the portion of the gain on the sale of land and buildings that relates to our operating expenses. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the decrease in the valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the European Union euro, the British pound and the Indian rupee, partially offset by the increase in the valuation of the United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen, increased operating expenses by $12.6 million in 2007, as compared to 2006. 2006 compared to 2005 Overall operating expenses increased $122.5 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $58.4 million in stock-based compensation expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; and • An increase of $49.2 million in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, primarily due to an increased number of employees and increases in bonus and commission costs, in part due to our acquisition of Verisity Ltd., or Verisity, in the second quarter of 2005. Marketing and Sales 2007 compared to 2006 Marketing and sales expense increased $1.5 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to: • An increase of $8.8 million in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, primarily due to an increased number of employees and increases in salary costs; partially offset by • A decrease of $1.8 million in stock-based compensation; • A decrease of $2.3 million in professional services costs; and 38 Table of Contents • A decrease of $3.8 million due to the portion of the gain on the sale of land and buildings that relates to Marketing and sales expense. 2006 compared to 2005 Marketing and sales expense increased $39.4 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $14.8 million in stock-based compensation expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; • An increase of $18.2 million in employee salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs due to increased hiring of sales and technical personnel, and higher commissions earned resulting from an increase in 2006 sales performance; and • An increase of $7.8 million in marketing programs and customer-focused conferences due to our new marketing initiatives and increased travel to visit our customers. Research and Development 2007 compared to 2006 Research and development expense increased $33.9 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to: • An increase of $38.1 million in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, primarily due to an increased number of employees to support product development, our acquisitions of Clear Shape Technologies, Inc. and Invarium, Inc., and increases in salary costs; • An increase of $4.1 million in third-party development costs; and • An increase of $2.9 million in computer equipment lease costs and maintenance costs associated with third-party software; partially offset by • A decrease of $4.6 million in stock-based compensation; and • A decrease of $6.5 million due to the portion of the gain on the sale of land and buildings that relates to Research and development expense. 2006 compared to 2005 Research and development expense increased $69.4 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $31.6 million in stock-based compensation expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; • An increase of $28.3 million in employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs due to increased staffing to support product development and higher employee salaries; • An increase of $3.9 million in third-party development costs; and • An increase of $3.3 million in computer equipment lease costs and maintenance costs associated with third-party software. General and Administrative 2007 compared to 2006 General and administrative expense increased $25.7 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to: • An increase of $18.4 million in litigation (see discussion under the heading “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings” above), legal and other professional services costs; • An increase of $8.2 million in employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs; • An increase of $3.9 million in stock-based compensation expense; and • An increase of $3.8 million in bad debt expense, reflecting a lower amount of bad debt recoveries; partially offset by • A decrease of $6.5 million in losses on the sale of installment contract receivables. 2006 compared to 2005 General and administrative expense increased $13.7 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to: • An increase of $12.0 million in stock-based compensation expense due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R; and 39 Table of Contents • An increase of $9.6 million in losses on the sale of installment contract receivables due to higher discount rates; partially offset by • A decrease of $7.1 million in costs related to the retirement of our Executive Chairman and former President and Chief Executive Officer in 2005; and • A decrease of $3.6 million in bad debt expense. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 19.4 $ 23.1 $ 47.8 2007 compared to 2006 Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $3.7 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease of $8.7 million resulting from the full amortization of certain acquired intangibles, which was partially offset by $5.0 million resulting from intangibles acquired during 2006 and 2007. 2006 compared to 2005 Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $24.7 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to a decrease of $27.5 million resulting from the full amortization of certain acquired intangibles, which was partially offset by $2.8 million resulting from intangibles acquired during 2005 and 2006. Restructuring and Other Charges We initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year from 2001 through 2005 in an effort to operate more efficiently. A summary of Restructuring and other charges in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: Severance and Asset- Excess Benefits Related Facilities Total (In millions) 2007 $ ---- $ ---- $ (9.7 ) $ (9.7 ) 2006 (0.1 ) ---- (0.7 ) (0.8 ) 2005 20.4 2.4 12.5 35.3 On October 5, 2007, we completed a lease termination agreement for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring plan, whereby we paid $8.2 million and were released from all future obligations related to the facility. We recorded a credit to Restructuring and other charges of $7.1 million during the year ended December 29, 2007, representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount paid. During 2005, we recorded Restructuring and other charges of $35.3 million, which included $20.4 million of workforce reduction costs associated primarily with our 2005 restructuring plan, and excess facility costs of $12.5 million, which consisted primarily of changes in lease loss estimates for facilities included in our 2001, 2002 and 2003 restructuring plans. Each reporting period, we evaluate the adequacy of the lease loss accrual. We adjust the lease loss accrual for changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect estimated costs or sublease income. We also consider executed sublease agreements and adjust the lease loss accrual if sublease income under the agreement differs from initial estimates. The credits recorded during 2007 and 2006 primarily relate to changes in lease loss estimates. As of December 29, 2007, our total amount accrued for restructuring and other charges of $10.2 million consisted solely of estimated lease losses related to the restructuring activities initiated since 2001. This amount may be adjusted in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring activities may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and 40 Table of Contents services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. Write-off of Acquired In-Process Research and Development Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to expense any acquired in-process research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired in-process research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established. The values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process research and development. The following table summarizes our write-offs of acquired in-process research and development charges in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005: 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Verisity Ltd. $ ---- $ ---- $ 9.4 2006 acquisition ---- 0.9 ---- 2007 acquisitions 2.7 ---- ---- Total in-process research and development $ 2.7 $ 0.9 $ 9.4 The following table summarizes, as of December 29, 2007, the status of in-process research and development acquired in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005: Estimated Expenditures Remaining Incurred to Expenditures Complete In- to Complete Expected Process In-Process Discount Commercial Research and Research and Rates Feasibility Development Development (In millions) Verisity Ltd. 19% to 32% December 2006 $ 4.3 $ ---- 2006 acquisition 33% January 2007 0.3 ---- 2007 acquisitions 19% to 21% December 2008 0.7 4.1 Total Expenditures $ 5.3 $ 4.1 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt We recorded a Loss on extinguishment of debt of $40.8 million during the year ended December 30, 2006, which includes a premium paid to repurchase a portion of the 2023 Notes of $38.9 million and a write-off of the related portion of unamortized deferred costs of issuing the 2023 Notes of $1.9 million. Interest Expense 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Interest expense $ 12.4 $ 12.3 $ 5.4 41 Table of Contents 2007 compared to 2006 During 2007, the primary component of Interest expense was the Convertible Senior Notes, which were issued in December 2006. During 2006, the primary component of interest expense was our Term Loan, the repayment of which was completed in March 2007. 2006 compared to 2005 Interest expense increased $6.9 million in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to the increased interest of $6.4 million related to our Term Loan, which was entered into on December 19, 2005 and the repayment of which was completed in March 2007. Other Income, net Other income, net, for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Interest income $ 48.1 $ 39.3 $ 15.6 Gains on sale of non-marketable securities 6.0 19.9 2.5 Gains on available-for-sale securities 4.4 6.7 9.2 Gains on securities in Cadence’s non-qualified deferred compensation trust 7.6 6.4 6.6 Gains (losses) on foreign exchange (2.4 ) 1.9 4.5 Telos termination costs ---- ---- (2.6 ) Telos management fees ---- (0.9 ) (2.4 ) Equity loss from investments (3.0 ) (1.2 ) (6.5 ) Write-down of investments (2.6 ) (2.5 ) (10.9 ) Other income (expense) 0.4 0.8 (0.9 ) Total other income, net $ 58.5 $ 70.4 $ 15.1 The increases in interest income in 2007, as compared to 2006, and in 2006, as compared to 2005, were due to increases in our Cash and cash equivalents balances as well as higher interest rates applicable to those balances. In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held by Telos Venture Partners, a limited partnership in which we and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust are the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration of $6.53 per share of common stock. In connection with this sale, we received approximately $20.2 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately $17.1 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. In addition, our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust received $2.9 million in cash and recorded a gain of $2.5 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. Under the purchase agreement, an additional 10% of the consideration was held in escrow, which was released to us and to the trust in January 2007. Upon receipt of these additional proceeds, we recorded a gain of $2.6 million and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust recorded a gain of $0.4 million in the year ended December 29, 2007. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (In millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 67.8 $ 99.7 $ 79.1 Effective tax rate 19% 41% 62% 42 Table of Contents 2007 compared to 2006 Our effective tax rate decreased in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefit of $27.8 million as a result of the effective settlement of certain tax matters with the IRS in December 2007 and an increase in benefit from foreign income, which is taxed at a lower rate than the United States federal statutory income tax rate, of $30.6 million, resulting from the conclusion of certain transfer pricing arrangements with a foreign subsidiary in 2006. We currently expect the effective tax rate for 2008 to be approximately 33%. The increase in the expected 2008 effective tax rate, as compared to 2007, is primarily due to the 2007 effective settlement of certain tax positions with the IRS and the expiration of the federal research tax credits after December 31, 2007, neither of which is expected to provide tax benefits in 2008. 2006 compared to 2005 Our effective tax rate decreased in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to the $30.1 million of federal, state and foreign income taxes incurred upon our 2005 repatriation of $500.0 million of certain foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act, which increased the 2005 annual effective tax rate by approximately 23 percentage points. Deferred Tax Assets and IRS Examinations As of December 29, 2007, we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately $250.6 million. Realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however, could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts, including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from those estimated. The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million. The most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 related to transfer pricing arrangements that we had with a foreign subsidiary. In December 2007, the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress, or the Joint Committee, approved and the Appeals Office executed settlement agreements resulting in an effective settlement of the transfer pricing dispute for purposes of FIN No. 48. As a result of this effective settlement, we recognized a tax benefit of $27.8 million in our Consolidated Income Statement. We did not reach a settlement with the Appeals Office of the IRS on separate tax refund claims that would increase our tax deductions for foreign trade income for the tax years 1997 through 1999. We continue to believe that our position is well supported and we are currently considering our options for further pursuing this matter. In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an RAR in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period. The proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately $152.0 million. The remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income. The IRS may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future examinations. We have filed a timely protest with the IRS and will seek resolution of the issues with the Appeals Office. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is compounded daily at rates published 43 Table of Contents by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between 4% and 10% since 2001. The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005. Significant judgment is required in applying the principles of FIN No. 48 and SFAS No. 109. The calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations. However, the final outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be estimated with certainty. In addition, we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination, we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of and for the years ended December 29, December 30, December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In millions, except percentages) Cash, cash equivalents and Short-term investments $ 1,078.1 $ 958.4 $ 894.6 Net working capital 744.1 763.9 670.5 Cash provided by operating activities 402.4 421.2 426.3 Cash used for investing activities (108.4 ) (111.8 ) (222.7 ) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities (170.1 ) (233.9 ) 205.3 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments As of December 29, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1,078.1 million of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments, as compared to $958.4 million as of December 30, 2006 and $894.6 million as of December 31, 2005. The primary sources of our cash in 2007 and 2006 were: • Customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or lease of our hardware products; • Customer payments for design and methodology services; • Proceeds from the sale of receivables; • Proceeds from the sale of land and buildings on our San Jose campus in 2007; • Proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in 2006; • Proceeds from the separate warrant sale transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in 2006; • Proceeds from the termination of a portion of the hedge transactions originally entered into in connection with the issuance of our 2023 Notes in 2006; • Proceeds from the exercise of stock options; and • Common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans. Our primary uses of cash in 2007 and 2006 consisted of: • Payments relating to payroll, product, services and other operating expenses; • Payments of taxes; • Purchases of property, plant and equipment, including payments associated with our construction of a new building on our headquarters campus in San Jose; • Payments of long-term debt and repurchases of a portion of the 2023 Notes; • Payments made to purchase hedges in connection with our issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in 2006; • Payments made to terminate a portion of the warrant transactions originally entered in connection with the issuance of our 2023 Notes in 2006; • Purchases of treasury stock; and 44 Table of Contents • Payments related to business acquisitions, asset acquisitions and intangible acquisitions. Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities are provided by net income, adjusted for certain non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, as well as changes in the balance of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our receivables. We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During 2007, we transferred accounts receivable, net of the losses on the sale of the receivables, totaling $215.4 million, which approximated fair value, to financing institutions on a non-recourse basis, as compared to $180.6 million in 2006 and $192.1 million in 2005. As a result of the credit losses recorded by banks in the second half of 2007, a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about over-exposure to the technology sector, and we expect a reduced level of Proceeds from the sale of receivables in 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities of $402.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2007 was primarily comprised of: • Net income, net of non-cash related expenses, of $533.0 million; • An increase in cash received for deferred revenue of $44.8 million; and • An increase in Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $20.4 million, primarily due to accrued severance and legal settlement costs, net of non-cash investing activities of $12.5 million for the purchase of acquired intangibles; partially offset by • An increase in Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables of $162.5 million, net of sales of receivables, due to the payment terms set forth in our license agreements; and • A decrease in Other long-term liabilities for the income tax benefit of a settlement with the IRS of $27.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities of $421.2 million for the year ended December 30, 2006 was primarily comprised of: • Net income, net of non-cash related expenses, of $427.1 million; • An increase in cash received for deferred revenue of $24.4 million; and • A decrease in Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables of $11.6 million, net of sales of receivables, due to the payment terms set forth in our license agreements; partially offset by • A decrease in Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $51.5 million, primarily due to payments of income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities of $426.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily comprised of: • Net income, net of non-cash related expenses, of $283.6 million; and • A decrease in Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables of $91.4 million, net of sales of receivables, due to the payment terms set forth in our license agreements; and • An increase in cash received for deferred revenue of $32.6 million. Cash flows from investing activities Our primary investing activities consisted of: • Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment; • Acquisitions of businesses, assets and intangibles; and • Proceeds from the sale of long-term investments. In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held by Telos Venture Partners, a limited partnership in which we and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust are the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration of $6.53 per share of common stock. In connection with this sale, we received 45 Table of Contents approximately $20.2 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately $17.5 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. In addition, our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust received $2.9 million in cash and recorded a gain of $2.5 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. Under the purchase agreement, an additional 10% of the consideration was held in escrow, which was released to us and to the trust in January 2007. Upon receipt of these additional proceeds, we recorded a gain of $2.6 million and our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust recorded a gain of $0.4 million in the year ended December 29, 2007. 2007 compared to 2006 Net cash used for investing activities decreased by $3.3 million in 2007, as compared to 2006. The decrease was primarily due to: • An increase of $46.2 million in Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment; partially offset by • A decrease of $19.7 million in Proceeds from the sale of Long-term investments; • An increase of $14.9 million in cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and acquisition of intangibles; and • An increase of $14.2 million in Purchases of property, plant and equipment, including payments associated with our construction of a new building on our San Jose campus. In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings. During the lease term, we are constructing an additional building located on our San Jose, California campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction. We used $21.0 million in cash during 2007 for construction of this new building. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, purchasing software licenses and making long-term equity investments. 2006 compared to 2005 Net cash used for investing activities decreased by $110.9 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily due to: • A decrease of $180.8 million in Purchases of short-term investments; and • A decrease of $231.4 million in Cash paid in business combinations, net of cash acquired and acquisition of intangibles; partially offset by • A decrease of $289.2 million in Proceeds from the sale of short-term investments; and • A decrease of $33.3 million in Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Cash flows from financing activities Financing cash flows during 2007 consisted primarily of the issuance of common stock under certain employee plans and purchases of treasury stock. 2007 compared to 2006 Net cash used for financing activities was $170.1 million in 2007, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $233.9 million in 2006. The change was primarily due to: • A net decrease of $224.8 million in cash received upon issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, net of cash paid to retire a portion of the 2023 Notes and the hedge and warrant transactions described below; partially offset by • An increase of $98.8 million in Proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to an increased number of stock options exercised during 2007; • A decrease of $104.0 million in Principal payments on the Term Loan; and • A decrease of $75.5 million in Purchases of treasury stock. 46 Table of Contents 2006 compared to 2005 Net cash used for financing activities was $233.9 million in 2006, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $205.3 million in 2005. The change was primarily due to: • A net increase of $224.8 million in cash received upon issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, net of cash paid to retire a portion of the 2023 Notes and the hedge and warrant transactions described below; partially offset by • An increase of $131.9 million in Principal payments on the Term Loan; and • An increase of $393.0 million in Purchases of treasury stock. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources Income Taxes We provide for United States income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside of the United States. As of December 29, 2007, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $424.2 million. As of December 29, 2007, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $139.8 million. As of December 29, 2007, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings outside of the United States. We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 on December 31, 2006, which was the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. We recognized a $59.4 million decrease in the net liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the December 31, 2006 balance of retained earnings. We also recognized a $42.6 million decrease in the net liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a $35.3 million increase in the December 31, 2006 balance of Common stock and capital in excess of par value and a $7.3 million decrease in the December 31, 2006 balance of Goodwill. Upon adoption of FIN No. 48, we also recognized additional long-term income tax assets of $115.0 million and additional long-term income tax liabilities of $115.0 million to present the unrecognized tax benefits as gross amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also decreased current income tax liabilities by $26.2 million and increased long-term income tax liabilities by the same amount based on our anticipation of the amount of cash payments to be made within one year. As of December 29, 2007, we had current income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $7.0 million. As of December 29, 2007, we had long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $259.8 million. For additional information on the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, see the discussion under the heading “Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements” below. The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million. The most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 related to transfer pricing arrangements that we had with a foreign subsidiary. In December 2007, the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress, or the Joint Committee, approved and the Appeals Office executed settlement agreements resulting in an effective settlement of the transfer pricing dispute for purposes of FIN No. 48. We expect to receive a refund of tax and interest of approximately $3.7 million during the first half of 2008. In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and in November 2006, the IRS issued an amended RAR in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of approximately $318.0 million. For an additional description of the IRS tax examinations, see the discussion under the heading “Results of Operations – Income Taxes” above. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between 4% and 10% since 2001. 47 Table of Contents 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively, the Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of approximately $487.0 million after transaction fees of approximately $13.0 million, including $12.0 million of underwriting discounts. A portion of the net proceeds totaling $228.5 million was used to purchase $189.6 million principal amount of our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023, or the 2023 Notes. Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events: • The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes; • Specified corporate transactions occur; or • The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below a certain threshold. On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of 2013 Notes, until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. We may not redeem the Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity. The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is 47.2813 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $21.15 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each day, during a specified observation period following the conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of the observation period consists of: • Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and • Our common stock to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity, we will, in certain cases, increase the conversion rate by an additional amount up to $8.27 per share, for a holder that elects to convert its Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such fundamental change, which amount will be paid entirely in cash. A fundamental change is any transaction or event (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) in connection with which more than 50% of our common stock is exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive, consideration which is not at least 90% shares of common stock, or depositary receipts representing such shares, that are: • Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or • Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national securities exchange. As of December 29, 2007, none of the conditions allowing the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met. Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each December 15th and June 15th. Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with various parties whereby we have the option to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $21.15 per share, subject to adjustment. These options expire on December 15, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and December 15, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net shares. The aggregate cost of these hedge transactions was $119.8 million and has been recorded as a reduction to Stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF No. 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a 48 Table of Contents Company’s Own Stock.” The estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was $98.1 million as of December 29, 2007. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity. In separate transactions, we also sold warrants to various parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2012 through April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes, and February 2014 through April 2014 in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net shares. We received $39.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants, which has been recorded as a reduction to Stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF No. 00-19. The estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was $35.7 million as of December 29, 2007. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these warrants will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity. The warrants will be included in diluted earnings per share, or EPS, to the extent the impact is not considered anti-dilutive. Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023 In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of $406.4 million after transaction fees of $13.6 million that were recorded in Other long-term assets and are being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over five years, which is the duration of the first redemption period. The 2023 Notes were issued by us at par and bear no interest. The 2023 Notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in December 2006, we repurchased $189.6 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes, reducing the aggregate number of shares to be issued upon conversion to 14.7 million. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The holders of the 2023 Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2023 Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount, by providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice. The repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase date. In addition, we may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount, except for those 2023 Notes that holders have required us to repurchase on August 15, 2008 or on other repurchase dates, as described above. Because the 2023 Notes can be redeemed by the holders on August 15, 2008, the 2023 Notes are classified as a Current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2007. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2023 Notes will initially be convertible into 63.8790 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes prior to maturity only if: • The price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during certain periods of time specified in the 2023 Notes; • Specified corporate transactions occur; • The 2023 Notes have been called for redemption; or • The trading price of the 2023 Notes falls below a certain threshold. In the event of a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their 2023 Notes for 100.00% of the principal amount. Upon a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure, in certain circumstances we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of December 29, 2007, none of the conditions allowing the holders of the 2023 Notes to convert had been met. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in December 2006, a portion of the proceeds were used to purchase in the open market 2023 Notes with a principal balance of $189.6 million for a total purchase price of $228.5 million. In connection with this purchase, we incurred expenses of $40.8 million for the early 49 Table of Contents extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt included the call premium on the purchased 2023 Notes and the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with a financial institution whereby we originally acquired options to purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the hedge transactions to us was $134.6 million. In connection with the purchase of a portion of the 2023 Notes in December 2006, we also sold 12.1 million of the hedges that were originally purchased in connection with the 2023 Notes and received proceeds of $55.9 million. In addition, we sold warrants for our common stock to a financial institution for the purchase of up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net shares. We received $56.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. In connection with the purchase of a portion of the 2023 Notes in December 2006, we also purchased 12.1 million of the warrants for our common stock that were originally issued in connection with the 2023 Notes at a cost of $10.2 million. The remaining outstanding warrants will be included in diluted EPS to the extent the impact is not considered anti-dilutive. As of December 29, 2007, the estimated fair value of the remaining hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes was $39.0 million and the estimated fair value of the remaining warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes was $0.2 million. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these hedge and warrant transactions will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2007 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less More Total Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Than 5 Years (In millions) Operating lease obligations $ 134.5 $ 42.2 $ 44.7 $ 20.5 $ 27.1 Purchase obligations 31.4 26.8 4.6 ---- ---- 2023 Notes * 231.0 231.0 ---- ---- ---- Convertible Senior Notes 500.0 ---- ---- 250.0 250.0 Contractual interest payments 36.3 7.2 14.4 10.9 3.8 Current income tax payable and Unrecognized tax benefits 15.3 15.3 ---- ---- ---- Other long-term contractual obligations u 226.4 ---- 219.7 3.5 3.2 Total $ 1,174.9 $ 322.5 $ 283.4 $ 284.9 $ 284.1 * The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount. Therefore, we have included $230.4 million of principal of the 2023 Notes and $0.6 million of premium on the potential repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the “Less Than 1 Year” column in the above table. u Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $259.8 million, and of that amount we estimate that $193.1 million will be paid within 1 to 3 years. We did not include the remaining long-term income tax liabilities of $66.7 million in the table above, because we estimated that this liability can be offset by available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and that future cash payments will not be required to settle this liability. However, the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing of such tax payments may depend upon the resolution of current and future tax examinations which cannot be estimated with 50 Table of Contents certainty. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily acquisition-related liabilities. With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of December 29, 2007 or the earliest cancellation date. In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to December 29, 2007, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $45.0 million in cash during the next 53 months if certain predefined performance goals are achieved in full. We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. As of December 29, 2007, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. New Accounting Standards In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business Combinations” and SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51.” SFAS No. 141R will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” Under SFAS No. 159, companies may elect to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of FSP FAS No. 157-2. Effective for fiscal 2008, we will adopt SFAS No. 157 except as it applies to those non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities as described in FSP FAS No. 157-2. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and costs associated with foreign currency hedges. We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond 51 Table of Contents appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 29, 2007. The following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified as Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2007. Carrying Average Value Interest Rate (In millions) Interest-Bearing Instruments: Cash – variable rate $ 62.6 2.96% Cash equivalents – variable rate 864.2 4.91% Cash equivalents – fixed rate 112.1 0.64% Total interest-bearing instruments $ 1,038.9 4.33% Foreign Currency Risk Most of our revenue, expenses and material business activity are transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening United States dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other income, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets. Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures. The following table provides information, as of December 29, 2007, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market 52 Table of Contents convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts matured prior to or during February 2008. Weighted Average Notional Contract Principal Rate (In millions) Forward Contracts: Japanese yen $ 44.8 110.60 British pound sterling 37.1 0.49 Indian rupee 11.6 39.38 Israeli shekel 8.0 3.93 Canadian dollar 6.5 1.01 European Union euro 6.1 0.68 Other 14.2 Total $ 128.3 Estimated fair value $ 1.6 While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Equity Price Risk 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013 In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes and collectively, the Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions, sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For an additional description of the Convertible Senior Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see the discussion under the heading “Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources” above. Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023 In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with one of the initial purchasers and in a separate transaction, sold warrants to one of the initial purchasers to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2023 Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. For an additional description of the 2023 Notes, including the hedge and warrants transactions, see the discussion under the heading “Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources” above. Investments We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under our strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. 53 Table of Contents The fair value of our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable equity securities, which are included in Short-term investments on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $14.9 million as of December 29, 2007 and $23.7 million as of December 30, 2006. While we actively monitor these investments, we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we own, would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be able to liquidate a particular investment when desired. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $26.2 million as of December 29, 2007 and $31.4 million as of December 30, 2006. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists for a non-marketable equity security, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write-down as an investment loss in our Consolidated Income Statements.",2023-12-30 20:47:15.299050

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements. Business Overview We develop EDA software, hardware and IP. We license software and IP, sell or lease hardware technology, provide maintenance for our offerings and provide engineering and education services to help manage and accelerate product development processes for semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ICs and electronics systems. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from IC and electronics systems manufacturers and designers and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects. As a result, our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers’ business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products. We have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the heading “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, income taxes, allowance for doubtful accounts, business combinations, intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software, VIP and Design IP and hardware products when all of the following criteria are met: • We have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; • Delivery has occurred; • The fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement; and • Collectibility of the fee is probable. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. We must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses, and we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments, products or services. 29 Table of Contents For installment contracts that do not include a substantial up-front payment, we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. While we do not expect our experience to change, if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are generally able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment. For subscription licenses of our software products, and term and perpetual licenses that do not include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning with delivery of the products, and such revenue is allocated between product and maintenance revenue. For term and perpetual licenses of our software products that include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate, we generally recognize revenue for software license fees up-front when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met, generally commencing upon delivery. In either case, maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the maintenance term. A relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an up-front basis. Sale of our hardware products generally involves the following deliverables: the hardware product and its related essential software, and maintenance for the hardware and the software. Consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Revenue from services contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances, and specification and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations. If a group of contracts is so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such arrangements are deemed to be a multiple element arrangement, or MEA. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, an MEA. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an MEA can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts, which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved. For example, when term license agreements that would otherwise result in up-front revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an MEA when they are executed within close proximity, or in contemplation of, other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer, in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the MEA instead of up-front. 30 Table of Contents For a single transaction or MEA that includes software and nonsoftware elements, we allocate consideration to all deliverables based on their relative standalone selling prices. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met. In these circumstances, there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows: • Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE; • Third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE; and • Best estimate of the selling price, or ESP. We calculate the ESP of our hardware products based on our pricing practices, including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products, because VSOE or TPE cannot be established. Our process for determining ESP for our software deliverables without VSOE or TPE takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Key external and internal factors considered in developing the ESPs include prices charged by us for similar arrangements, historical pricing practices and the nature of the product. In addition, when developing ESPs, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the ESP of the deliverables in our arrangements. Accounting for Income Taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements using the asset and liability method. We also apply a two-step approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision (benefit) for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision (benefit) for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if there is a greater than 50% likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. We give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. For example, we determined that our cumulative loss incurred in the United States for the three year period ended December 31, 2011 was significant negative evidence with a high level objectivity that outweighed our ability to rely on projections of future income. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011, we concluded that a significant valuation allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence. If, in the future, we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made. For an additional description of the valuation allowance, see Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the 31 Table of Contents largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. To determine when a tax position is effectively settled, we must estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would re-review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed. We must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal year-end. These judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for other reasons. In addition, we are required by the IRS to disclose uncertain tax positions taken on our federal tax returns. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. This allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers, historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve. While we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions, which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected change in a customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customer’s payment trends, or a downward trend in the volume of business in the semiconductor sector, are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Business Combinations When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to acquired tangible assets and liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities. We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life over which we amortize our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations. Intangible Asset and Goodwill Impairments We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including certain intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset group’s carrying amount. 32 Table of Contents Recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group, excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment is required in: • Identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances; • Forecasting future operating results; and • Estimating the proceeds, if any, from the disposition of long-lived or intangible asset group. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated and if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair-value hierarchy: • Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; • Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and • Level 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. This hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. We recognize transfers between levels of this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency, are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. For those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, our best estimate is used. While we believe the observable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in Level 2 and the unobservable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are reasonable, different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations. For an additional description of our fair value measurements see Note 9 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations Overview of Fiscal 2011 Financial results for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, reflect the following: • An increase in revenue primarily because of: • Increased bookings of $1,158 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to $956 million during fiscal 2010 and $615 million during fiscal 2009, including bookings that resulted from our acquisition of Denali in the second quarter of fiscal 2010; • Increases in the sale and lease of our hardware products; • Our continuing transition to a ratable license mix, under which most orders made in any period generate revenue in future periods; and • Shorter average contract duration. • An increase in the cost of hardware products sold due to increases in the sale and lease of our hardware products; • An increase in employee-related costs for commissions and other employee incentive compensation primarily resulting from improving business levels, partially offset by decreased costs as a result of our 2009 and 2010 restructuring plans; • An increase in operating expenses, primarily research and development, including incremental expenses attributable to the acquisition of Denali; • Net recoveries of our allowance for doubtful accounts during fiscal 2010 and, to a lesser extent, fiscal 2011, from collection of certain receivables that had previously been included in our allowance for doubtful accounts as of the end of fiscal 2009; • The agreements we reached in February 2011 to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation and the associated $15.8 million Litigation charge we recorded during fiscal 2010; • Effective settlement during fiscal 2010 of the IRS examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002, which resulted in a benefit for income taxes of $147.9 million; and • The increase in deferred tax liabilities from the intangible assets acquired with Denali and the resulting benefit for income taxes because of the release of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during fiscal 2010. Revenue We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software and IP, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, IP and hardware and providing engineering services. We principally use three license types: subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types provide a customer with different conditions of use for our products, such as: • The right to access new technology; • The duration of the license; and • Payment timing. The timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized over multiple periods or up-front, upon completion of delivery. We seek to achieve a mix of bookings with approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our bookings of a type for which the revenue is recurring, or ratable, in nature, and approximately 10% of the resulting revenue recognized up-front, upon completion of delivery. Our ability to achieve this 90% to 10% ratio of ratable to up-front bookings may be impacted by an increase in hardware sales beyond our current expectations, because revenue for hardware sales is generally recognized up-front in the quarter in which it is installed and ready for use. For an additional description of the impact of hardware sales on the anticipated mix of bookings, see the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates — Revenue Recognition” above, and Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 34 Table of Contents Approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our bookings during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was of a type for which the revenue is recurring, or ratable, in nature. Approximately 90% of our fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 revenue came from ratable bookings. Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use, this will result in either a subscription or term license. A business implication of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Historically, larger customers generally have used products from two or more of our five product groups and rarely completely terminated their relationship with us upon expiration of the license. For an additional description of license types and timing of revenue recognition, see the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates — Revenue Recognition” above. Although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period, we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the: • Competitiveness of our new technology; • Length of our sales cycle; and • Size, duration, timing, terms and type of: • Contract renewals with existing customers; • Additional sales to existing customers; and • Sales to new customers. The value and renewal of contracts, and consequently product revenue recognized, are affected by the competitiveness of our products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription, term or perpetual licenses, and by the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms. Revenue Mix We analyze our software, VIP and Design IP and hardware businesses by product group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into categories, as described in the various product groups below: Digital IC Design: Products in this group, including the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to create and convert the high-level, logical representation of a digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint, and ultimately, produce the detailed design information describing how the IC will be manufactured. The final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the IC. Functional Verification and Design IP: Products in this group, including the Incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the high-level, logical representation of an IC design is functionally correct, and for verification at the system and SoC levels. Our emulation hardware products, VIP products, memory sub-system models, and Design IP products are also included in this product group. Custom IC Design: Our custom design products, including the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used to create ICs that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog, RF, memory, high-performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries. Included in this group are specialized verification products that simulate the operation of the design prior to manufacturing. The final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the IC. Design for Manufacturing: Included in the DFM product group are our physical verification, manufacturing optimization, and layout analysis products. These products are used to analyze, optimize, and verify that the physical blueprint of the IC has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully. While our primary focus in DFM is to address manufacturing effects in the upstream digital and custom design flows, those products included in this DFM category also are offered separately from our other tools. 35 Table of Contents System Interconnect Design: This product group consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including the Allegro and OrCAD® products. The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co-design of interconnects across ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions. For an additional description of our current product strategy, see the discussion under the heading “Products and Product Strategy” under Item 1, “Business.” Revenue by Year The following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 with the dollar and percentage change in revenue between years: 2011 2010 2009 Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions, except percentages) Product $ 640.8 $ 471.6 $ 400.8 $ 169.2 36% $ 70.8 18% Services 116.7 100.9 106.5 15.8 16% (5.6 ) (5% ) Maintenance 392.3 363.5 345.3 28.8 8% 18.2 5% Total revenue $ 1,149.8 $ 936.0 $ 852.6 $ 213.8 23% $ 83.4 10% Product revenue increased during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily because of increased business levels, an increase in revenue related to the sale and lease of our hardware products, increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods, a decrease in the average contract duration and an increase in revenue from the business of Denali, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect to recognize increased product revenue during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, due to higher business levels, increased revenue from our backlog and our continued transition to a more ratable license mix. Product revenue increased during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily because of higher business levels due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers and from contracts executed in prior quarters due to our continued transition to a ratable license mix. Services revenue increased during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily because of cash collections from customers on orders fulfilled in years prior to 2011 for which revenue was recognized in fiscal 2011 upon receipt of cash payment, and because of higher utilization rates for our services personnel. We expect a decrease in services revenue during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, as certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects and to assist with pre-sales activities. Maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2011, as compared to 2010, and during 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily because of higher business levels due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers. We adopted new revenue recognition accounting standards on the first day of fiscal 2011 for revenue arrangements that include both hardware and software elements. If we had accounted for all MEAs entered into on or after January 2, 2011 under the software revenue recognition standards, regardless of whether they included hardware, revenue for fiscal 2011 would have been lower by $15.4 million. For an additional description of our adoption of these accounting standards, see Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Table of Contents The following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and Services and other during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Functional Verification and Design IP 30% 24% 22% Digital IC Design 22% 23% 21% Custom IC Design 22% 26% 27% System Interconnect Design 9% 9% 11% Design for Manufacturing 7% 7% 7% Services and other 10% 11% 12% Total 100% 100% 100% The changes in the percentage of revenue contributed by the Functional Verification and Design IP product group for the fiscal years presented are generally related to increased hardware revenue and from our acquisition of Denali in June 2010. As described in Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement. Revenue by Geography 2011 2010 2009 Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions, except percentages) United States $ 489.4 $ 382.7 $ 370.0 $ 106.7 28% $ 12.7 3% Other Americas 25.1 22.2 20.9 2.9 13% 1.3 6% Europe, Middle East and Africa 234.9 207.2 188.9 27.7 13% 18.3 10% Japan 204.4 165.2 152.8 39.2 24% 12.4 8% Asia 196.0 158.7 120.0 37.3 24% 38.7 32% Total revenue $ 1,149.8 $ 936.0 $ 852.6 $ 213.8 23% $ 83.4 10% The increase in revenue across our geographies is primarily because of increased business levels, an increase in revenue related to the sale and lease of our hardware products, increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods, a decrease in the average contract duration and an increase in revenue from the business of Denali, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. 37 Table of Contents Revenue by Geography as a Percentage of Total Revenue 2011 2010 2009 United States 43% 41% 43% Other Americas 2% 2% 3% Europe, Middle East and Africa 20% 22% 22% Japan 18% 18% 18% Asia 17% 17% 14% No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, and we recognize additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the United States dollar weakens in value against the Japanese yen and reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the United States dollar strengthens against the Japanese yen. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements, see the discussion under the heading “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk.” Stock-based Compensation Expense Summary Stock-based compensation expense is recorded within the various components of our costs and expenses. Stock-based compensation expense did not change significantly during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, and decreased by $11.2 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following: • The decrease in the maximum purchase limits under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and a lower weighted-average grant date fair value of purchase rights granted; and • A decrease in stock bonuses. We expect stock-based compensation to increase during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, due to higher grant date fair values of restricted stock, option awards and purchase rights granted under the ESPP, based on the assumption that our stock price will be higher during fiscal 2012 than in the prior years. 38 Table of Contents Cost of Revenue Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions, except percentages) Product $ 69.7 $ 31.4 $ 32.1 $ 38.3 122% $ (0.7 ) (2% ) Services 81.5 83.0 90.5 (1.5 ) (2% ) (7.5 ) (8% ) Maintenance 44.0 42.1 46.6 1.9 5% (4.5 ) (10% ) The following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Product 11% 7% 8% Services 70% 82% 85% Maintenance 11% 12% 13% Cost of Product Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our hardware and licensing of our software and Design IP products. Cost of product associated with our hardware products includes materials, assembly and overhead. These additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and Design IP products. Cost of product also includes the cost of employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products, as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. A summary of cost of product during the last three fiscal years is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Product related costs $ 59.2 $ 25.8 $ 27.8 Amortization of acquired intangibles 10.5 5.6 4.3 Total cost of product $ 69.7 $ 31.4 $ 32.1 The changes in cost of product were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Hardware costs $ 31.0 $ (1.4 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles 4.9 1.3 Other individually insignificant items 2.4 (0.6 ) $ 38.3 $ (0.7 ) Hardware costs increased by $31.0 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in hardware business. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product increased during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the Denali acquisition for a full fiscal year, as well as amortization from other acquisitions completed in 2011. 39 Table of Contents Cost of product depends primarily upon the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period, and upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology. Cost of Services Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. The changes in cost of services were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ (1.1 ) $ (3.4 ) Stock-based compensation (0.1 ) (1.1 ) Professional services 0.5 (1.0 ) Other individually insignificant items (0.8 ) (2.0 ) $ (1.5 ) $ (7.5 ) We expect cost of services to decrease during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, as certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects and to assist with pre-sales activities. Cost of Maintenance Cost of maintenance includes the cost of our customer support services, such as telephone, online and on-site support, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, and documentation of maintenance updates, as well as amortization of intangible assets directly related to our maintenance contracts. The changes in cost of maintenance were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ 2.2 $ 1.3 Amortization of acquired intangibles (1.0 ) (3.1 ) Other individually insignificant items 0.7 (2.7 ) $ 1.9 $ (4.5 ) Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased by $1.0 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, and decreased by $3.1 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include costs presented as marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative. Changes in our overall operating expenses in any given period are primarily attributable to changes in employee salary and other compensation-related costs. Factors that may cause our headcount costs to fluctuate may include changes in the number of employees due to hiring, acquisitions, restructuring activities, foreign exchange rates, cost reduction strategies and the impact of our various incentive 40 Table of Contents compensation programs which are driven by overall business performance. Our employee salary and other compensation-related costs increased during fiscal 2011, when compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to improved business levels in 2011 resulting in higher sales commissions and other incentive compensation. Our operating expenses for 2010 and 2011 also included the incremental costs associated with our acquisition of Denali in June 2010. We expect operating expenses to increase during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to projected increases in salary, benefits, incentive compensation and other employee-related costs expected to be incurred in connection with the anticipated continued improvement in our business, and investment in our research and development activities. Our operating expenses for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were as follows: Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions, except percentages) Operating expenses $ 817.4 $ 768.4 $ 764.2 $ 49.0 6% $ 4.2 1% Percentage of total revenue 71% 82% 90% Marketing and Sales Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions, except percentages) Marketing and sales $ 323.8 $ 305.6 $ 286.8 $ 18.2 6% $ 18.8 7% Percentage of total revenue 28% 33% 34% The changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs $ 22.3 $ 19.5 Executive and other severance 2.5 0.6 Stock-based compensation 0.5 (2.5 ) Depreciation (1.7 ) (4.4 ) Marketing programs and events (3.5 ) 4.2 Other individually insignificant items (1.9 ) 1.4 $ 18.2 $ 18.8 Research and Development Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions, except percentages) Research and Development $ 400.7 $ 376.4 $ 354.7 $ 24.3 6% $ 21.7 6% Percentage of total revenue 35% 40% 42% 41 Table of Contents The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs $ 23.8 $ 35.5 Executive and other severance 2.2 ---- Stock-based compensation 0.2 (8.0 ) Facilities and other infrastructure costs (3.4 ) (2.5 ) Other individually insignificant items 1.5 (3.3 ) $ 24.3 $ 21.7 We recorded employee-related costs in research and development expense of $1.5 million during fiscal 2011, and $10.2 million during fiscal 2010, related to deferred Denali acquisition payments and we expect to expense the remaining $0.9 million over the stated retention periods through 2014. For an additional description of the deferred Denali acquisition payments, see Note 4 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. General and Administrative Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions, except percentages) General and Administrative $ 92.9 $ 86.4 $ 122.7 $ 6.5 8% $ (36.3 ) (30% ) Percentage of total revenue 8% 9% 14% The changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Bad debt expense (recoveries), net $ 9.9 $ (38.1 ) Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs 3.4 6.6 Impairment of property, plant and equipment ---- (5.6 ) Stock-based compensation (0.5 ) 1.1 Facilities and other infrastructure costs (1.2 ) (3.5 ) Legal and other professional services costs (2.4 ) 0.6 Other individually insignificant items (2.7 ) 2.6 $ 6.5 $ (36.3 ) We recorded net recoveries of our allowance for doubtful accounts of $6.6 million during fiscal 2011 and $16.5 million during fiscal 2010 because we collected certain receivables that previously had been included in our allowance for doubtful accounts. We had previously recorded reserves for certain customers based on changes in our assessment of collectability for those customers. The principal factor for the assessment at that time was a general deterioration of economic conditions having a significant impact on certain customers. As a result, we recorded $21.6 million of reserves during fiscal 2009 for certain customer balances estimated to be uncollectible at that time. These customers’ business prospects eventually improved, and we were able to collect the majority of those receivables that had previously been reserved, resulting in recoveries of previously reserved 42 Table of Contents bad debts in excess of increases in bad debt reserves for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. For an additional description of our allowance for doubtful accounts, see Note 8 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions, except percentages) Amortization of Acquired Intangibles $ 16.5 $ 14.2 $ 11.4 $ 2.3 16% $ 2.8 25% The changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Increase due to additions of acquired intangibles $ 4.4 $ 5.1 Decrease due to completed amortization of acquired intangibles (2.1 ) (2.3 ) $ 2.3 $ 2.8 Restructuring and Other Charges (Credits) We initiated multiple restructuring plans in previous years, including a 2009 restructuring plan and a 2010 restructuring plan. For an additional description of these restructuring plans, see Note 7 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. The following table presents restructuring and other charges (credits) for our restructuring plans: SeveranceandBenefits ExcessFacilities Other Total (In millions) Fiscal 2011 $ (0.9 ) $ 1.3 $ ---- $ 0.4 Fiscal 2010 5.2 1.2 3.8 10.2 Fiscal 2009 32.1 (0.7 ) ---- 31.4 Restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to our restructuring plans. Litigation Charges In February 2011, we agreed to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation, subject to completion of final settlement documentation by the parties and court approval. Accordingly, we recorded litigation charges of $15.8 million during fiscal 2010. Total settlement costs were $40.0 million, less $24.2 million paid by our insurance carriers. For an additional description of our legal proceedings and this settlement, see Note 16 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Table of Contents Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Contractual cash interest expense: 2011 Notes $ 2.0 $ 2.7 $ 3.4 2013 Notes 2.1 2.9 3.8 2015 Notes 9.2 5.0 ---- Amortization of debt discount: 2011 Notes 6.8 8.6 10.4 2013 Notes 5.9 7.5 9.0 2015 Notes 13.7 7.0 ---- Amortization of deferred financing costs: 2011 Notes 0.7 0.8 1.0 2013 Notes 0.4 0.5 0.6 2015 Notes 1.9 0.9 ---- Capitalized interest expense (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.5 ) Other interest expense 0.4 0.6 1.2 Total interest expense $ 43.0 $ 36.3 $ 28.9 On December 15, 2011, we paid the remaining balance of our 2011 Notes in full. As a result, we expect interest expense to decrease during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, as we will not incur any interest expense or amortization of deferred financing costs for the 2011 Notes during fiscal 2012. The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was due to interest expense related to the 2015 Notes that were issued in June 2010. For an additional description of our 2015 Notes and 2013 Notes, see Note 3 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Interest income $ 1.3 $ 1.2 $ 2.6 Gains on sale of non-marketable securities 8.3 4.9 ---- Gains on available-for-sale securities and short-term investments 8.0 0.1 2.3 Gains (losses) on securities in the non-qualified deferred compensation trust (0.5 ) 2.6 (1.0 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt ---- (5.7 ) ---- Gains on foreign exchange 0.7 0.4 0.4 Equity loss from investments (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.5 ) Write-down of investments ---- (1.5 ) (5.2 ) Other income 0.4 0.6 0.4 Total other income (expense), net $ 18.1 $ 2.5 $ (1.0 ) Certain of our non-marketable securities became marketable during fiscal 2011, and we sold them and recognized a gain of $8.0 million. Certain of non-marketable securities were other-than-temporarily impaired and we wrote down these non-marketable securities by $1.5 million during fiscal 2010 and $5.2 million during fiscal 2009. 44 Table of Contents Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rates during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In millions, except percentages) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 23.2 $ (189.3 ) $ (3.6 ) Effective tax rate 24% 302% 2% Our fiscal 2011 provision for income taxes is primarily related to $11.4 million of tax expense on certain of our foreign subsidiaries, $5.4 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation that were allocated to stockholder’s equity, and $4.1 million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits that was partially offset by $5.0 million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities resulting from a fiscal 2011 business combination. Our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes is primarily related to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest of $147.9 million as a result of our effective settlement of certain tax matters with the IRS in August 2010 and the release of $66.7 million of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of intangibles with Denali in June 2010. Our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes included $4.6 million of tax expense for uncertain tax positions that should have been recognized during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. The effects of this tax expense on our Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2010, and prior fiscal years, are not considered material. During fiscal 2009, a change in United States federal tax law allowed companies to elect to carry back the fiscal 2009 net operating loss for a period of three, four or five years instead of the general two-year carryback period. Our benefit for income taxes during fiscal 2009 is primarily due to $27.3 million of tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 United States federal net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in prior years, that is partially offset by current year interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of $13.3 million, and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest related to prior year tax positions of $14.5 million. With the exception of the fiscal 2009 United States federal net operating loss that can be utilized in prior years, we recorded a valuation allowance that offset the tax benefit from other fiscal 2009 United States losses and tax credits. The $14.5 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest during fiscal 2009 included $7.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest that should have been recognized during multiple periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008. The effects on our Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2009 and prior periods are not considered material. We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $173.8 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011, to meet the working capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $83.5 million as of December 31, 2011. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more than 50% likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We concluded that a valuation allowance of $375.9 million was required as of December 31, 2011. This represents an increase in valuation allowance of $1.2 million in comparison with the year ended January 1, 2011. If, in the future, we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made. For an additional description of our income taxes, including the calculation of our valuation allowance, our deferred tax assets, and the status of the IRS examinations, see Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change December 31,2011 January 1,2011 January 2,2010 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents and Short-term investments $ 604.6 $ 570.1 $ 571.3 $ 34.5 $ (1.2 ) Net working capital* $ 48.6 $ 181.9 $ 452.8 $ (133.3 ) $ (270.9 ) Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 240.3 $ 199.1 $ 25.6 $ 41.2 $ 173.5 Cash used for investing activities $ (56.5 ) $ (285.1 ) $ (50.5 ) $ 228.6 $ (234.6 ) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ (144.8 ) $ 59.9 $ 21.0 $ (204.7 ) $ 38.9 * The decrease in our net working capital as of December 31, 2011, as compared to January 1, 2011, is primarily due to the classification of our 2015 Notes as a current liability as of December 31, 2011. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments As of December 31, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $604.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $570.1 million as of January 1, 2011 and $571.3 million as of January 2, 2010. Our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were: • Customer payments for products, maintenance and services; • Proceeds from the issuance of our 2015 Notes during fiscal 2010; • Proceeds from the sale of our 2015 Warrants during fiscal 2010; • Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities and long-term investments; and • Cash received for common stock from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of employee stock options. Our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were: • Payments relating to salaries, benefits, other employee-related costs and other operating expenses, including our restructuring plans; • Repurchase of a portion of our 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes during fiscal 2010, and payment of the remaining principal balance of the 2011 Notes during fiscal 2011; • Acquisitions payments, net of cash acquired; • Payments made to purchase the 2015 Notes Hedges during fiscal 2010; • Purchases of treasury stock during fiscal 2010; • Purchases of inventory related to our hardware products; • Purchases of property, plant and equipment; and • Payments related to the anticipated settlement of our securities litigation. Approximately 50% of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011. Our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations. We do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations. In the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund United States liquidity, we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds. 46 Table of Contents We expect that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. Net Working Capital The changes in net working capital were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Increase in convertible notes (150.8 ) (143.3 ) Decrease in receivables, net (55.1 ) (8.7 ) Increase (decrease) in prepaid expenses and other (14.1 ) 23.7 Increase (decrease) in short-term investments (9.7 ) 10.5 Increase in current portion of deferred revenue (3.0 ) (89.7 ) Increase in inventories 4.2 14.9 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 44.2 (11.7 ) Decrease (increase) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 51.1 (66.7 ) Other individually insignificant items (0.1 ) 0.1 $ (133.3) $ (270.9 ) The decrease in our net working capital as of December 31, 2011, as compared to January 1, 2011, is primarily due to the classification of our 2015 Notes as a current liability as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the 2015 Notes are convertible into cash from January 1, 2012 through March 31, 2012, because Cadence’s stock price exceeded $9.81 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period prior to December 31, 2011. Accordingly, we classified the net balance of the 2015 Notes of $294.1 million as a current liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011. The classification of the 2015 Notes as current or long-term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet is evaluated at each balance sheet date and may change from time to time depending on whether the stock price conversion condition, as described above, has been met in a particular quarter. If the note holders elect to convert their 2015 Notes prior to maturity, any unamortized discount and transaction fees will be expensed at the time of conversion. If the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on December 31, 2011, we would have recorded an expense of $63.6 million associated with the conversion, comprised of $55.9 million of unamortized debt discount and $7.7 million of unamortized transaction fees. The classification of the liability associated with the cash conversion feature of the 2015 Notes, or the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative, and the 2015 Notes Hedges asset as current or long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet corresponds with the classification of the 2015 Notes. As such, we classified the fair value of the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative as a current liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011, which increased our total current liabilities by $215.1 million. We also classified the fair value of the 2015 Notes Hedges as current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011, which increased total current assets by $215.1 million. The value of the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative liability and the value of the 2015 Notes Hedges asset were offsetting and resulted in no net change to our net working capital as of December 31, 2011. If the holders of our 2015 Notes elect to convert their notes into cash, we would be required to make cash payments of up to $350.0 million prior to the maturity of the 2015 Notes. In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the $350.0 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes currently trade at a premium to their if-converted value, so we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 Notes 47 Table of Contents by the note holders between January 1, 2012 and March 31, 2012. However, if the holders of the 2015 Notes elect to convert their notes between January 1, 2012 and March 31, 2012, we expect to have sufficient cash to fund any payment resulting from this conversion. For an additional description of our 2015 Notes, see “Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 3 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities The changes in net cash provided by operating activities were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Net income (loss), net of non-cash related gains and losses $ 10.8 $ 161.3 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effect of acquired businesses 30.4 18.0 Proceeds from the sale of receivables, net ---- (5.8 ) $ 41.2 $ 173.5 Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements. If our customers experience adverse changes in the future, are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they may delay purchasing our products and services, or they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. Our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. Though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations. For an additional description of our accounts receivable and our allowances for doubtful accounts, see Note 8 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2011, all parties to our securities and derivative litigation agreed to settle the litigation for total consideration of $40.0 million, of which $24.2 million was to be paid by our insurance carriers. During fiscal 2011, we paid $16.4 million into a securities litigation settlement fund, which amount included our portion of the settlement consideration plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2011, we have paid, and our insurance carriers have paid, all amounts specified by the settlement agreement into the securities litigation settlement fund. The settlements are subject to court approval. We expect to pay an additional $5.0 million related to our previous restructuring activities, primarily for payments related to vacated facilities, net of expected sublease income. During fiscal 2011, we determined that uncertain tax positions that were subject to the IRS examination of our federal corporation income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2009 were effectively settled. We do not expect the effective settlement to result in significant cash payments. We expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including our operating results and the timing of our billings, collections and tax payments. 48 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities The changes in net cash from investing activities were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and acquisitions of intangibles $ 214.8 $ (243.9 ) Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities 9.8 (4.1 ) Purchases of property, plant and equipment 3.4 6.5 Investment in venture capital partnerships and equity investments 2.4 (0.7 ) Proceeds from sale of long-term investments (0.5 ) 10.3 Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment (0.9 ) (3.0 ) Other individually insignificant items (0.4 ) 0.3 $ 228.6 $ (234.6 ) The changes in net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, and during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, is primarily due to cash paid for our acquisition of Denali during fiscal 2010 for an aggregate initial purchase price of $296.8 million. For an additional description of our acquisition of Denali, see Note 4 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with our business combinations and asset acquisitions completed before December 31, 2011, we may be obligated to make payments based on, or subject to the satisfaction of, certain performance metrics. If performance is such that these payments are fully achieved, we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $30.7 million in cash during the next 52 months. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, purchasing software licenses, business combinations, and making long-term equity investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities During fiscal 2011, we paid the $150.0 million remaining principal balance on the 2011 Notes in full. During fiscal 2010, we issued $350.0 million principal amount of the 2015 Notes. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 Notes that may be due to the holders. In separate transactions, we also sold warrants, or the 2015 Warrants, to purchase our common stock at a strike price of $10.78 per share. We used an aggregate of $187.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 Notes to purchase in the open market $100.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes and $100.0 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes, and we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $40.0 million. In a separate transaction during fiscal 2010, we repurchased in the open market $5.5 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes. 49 Table of Contents The changes in net cash from financing activities were due to the following: Change 2011 vs.2010 2010 vs.2009 (In millions) Proceeds from issuance of 2015 Notes, net of issuance costs $ (339.5 ) $ 339.5 Proceeds from sale of 2015 Warrants (37.5 ) 37.5 Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 6.1 (14.4 ) Tax effect related to employee stock transactions allocated to equity 15.0 (10.8 ) Purchases of treasury stock 40.0 (40.0 ) Purchase of 2015 Notes Hedges 76.6 (76.6 ) Payments of 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes 42.4 (192.4 ) Other individually insignificant items (7.8 ) (3.9 ) $ (204.7 ) $ 38.9 For an additional description of our 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes, and the conversion terms thereof, see Note 3 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Net Working Capital,” above. During fiscal 2010, we paid $9.7 million of taxes related to employee stock transactions. See Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this payment. The increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, resulted from an increase in employee participation in our ESPP, an increase in the exercise of stock options and an increase in our stock price. The decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, is primarily due to decreased purchase limits under our ESPP, which became effective during fiscal 2009. We recorded losses on the reissuance of treasury stock of $16.6 million during fiscal 2011, $87.4 million during fiscal 2010 and $213.4 million during fiscal 2009. As of December 31, 2011, we have $814.4 million remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. See Note 13 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2011, we have convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of approximately $426.0 million, which mature between December 15, 2013 and June 1, 2015. The principal maturity value of these convertible notes is approximately $494.7 million. The total cash or stock payable upon the early conversion of these notes, as determined by the indenture of each security, will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be contractually due upon conversion. In the case of our 2015 Notes, we will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $7.55 per share. We entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 Notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion. In separate transactions, we sold warrants with a strike price of $10.78 per share. Although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the hedges to the $350.0 million outstanding principal value of the 2015 Notes, we will experience dilution to our stock and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds $10.78. Additionally, holders may convert their 2015 Notes into cash during the quarters our stock price closes above $9.81 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period preceding the end of each fiscal quarter. While holders of the 2015 Notes would have the right to convert their notes if early conversion conditions are met, we do not expect holders of the 2015 Notes to convert their notes under such circumstances because the economic value to the holders of the notes has exceeded and likely would exceed the cash received upon conversion. If holders of the 2015 Notes were to choose to convert at a time in which the notes are convertible, it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity. 50 Table of Contents In the case of our 2013 Notes, we may owe shares of our common stock to the note holders upon conversion if our stock price exceeds $21.15 per share. We entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the dilution that may result from the issuance of shares upon conversion of the 2013 Notes. In separate transactions, we sold warrants with a strike price of $31.50 per share. We will experience dilution to our stock and to diluted earnings per share from the outstanding warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds $31.50. We expect to fund the maturity of the 2013 Notes in December 2013 with our cash on hand and future cash flows from operations. The 2013 Notes could become convertible prior to their maturity if certain conversion conditions are met. However, we do not currently expect any of the conversion conditions to be met prior to the maturity of the 2013 Notes. We believe that we will have sufficient cash in future periods to service the maturities of our 2015 Notes, but future changes in our cash position, cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, cash flows from financing activities, as well as general business levels and changes in our access to financing may impact our future ability to settle the principal amount payable to the holders of the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes when they mature or convert. For an additional description of the 2015 Notes and 2013 Notes, the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Net Working Capital,” above. Income Taxes We provide for United States income taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. As of December 31, 2011, we had a deferred tax liability of $5.6 million related to $5.4 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which we have previously accrued income tax expense. We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $173.8 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011, to meet the working capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $83.5 million as of December 31, 2011. During fiscal 2011, we determined that uncertain tax positions that were subject to the IRS examinations of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2009 were effectively settled. During fiscal 2011, we made additional cash payments of approximately $4.1 million to the IRS and to various state and local tax authorities to cover the significant portion of our remaining tax liabilities related to these settlements. As of December 31, 2011, we had long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $71.2 million. For an additional description of the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, see the discussion under the heading “Contractual Obligations.” 51 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions) Operating lease obligations $ 80.9 $ 20.4 $ 28.3 $ 18.6 $ 13.6 Purchase obligations(4) 35.6 27.9 5.5 2.2 ---- 2023 Notes(1) 0.2 ---- 0.2 ---- ---- 2013 Notes 144.5 ---- 144.5 ---- ---- 2015 Notes(3) 350.0 350.0 ---- ---- ---- Contractual interest payments 36.5 11.4 20.5 4.6 ---- Current income tax payable and unrecognized tax benefits 6.5 6.5 ---- ---- ---- Other long-term contractual obligations (2),(3) 88.1 ---- 76.8 1.9 9.4 Total $ 742.3 $ 416.2 $ 275.8 $ 27.3 $ 23.0 (1) The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash the remaining portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount. Therefore, we have included $0.2 million of principal of the 2023 Notes on the potential repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the 1-3 Years column in the table above. (2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $71.2 million, and of that amount we estimate that $67.9 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years. We did not include the remaining long-term income tax liabilities of $3.3 million in the table above, because we estimated that this liability can be offset by available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and that future cash payments will not be required to settle this liability. However, the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing of such tax payments may depend upon the resolution of current and future tax examinations that cannot be estimated with certainty. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisition-related liabilities. (3) Holders of the 2015 Notes can convert their 2015 Notes into cash during a fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $9.81 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period preceding the end of the preceding fiscal quarter. This conversion condition was met for the 2015 Notes during the three months ended December 31, 2011, and the 2015 Notes are convertible into cash from January 1, 2012 through March 31, 2012. Accordingly, we classified the net balance of the 2015 Notes of $294.1 million as a current liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011. In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the $350.0 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes currently trade at a premium to their if-converted value, so we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 Notes by the note holders between January 1, 2012 and March 31, 2012. (4) With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of December 31, 2011 or the earliest cancellation date. 52 Table of Contents In connection with our acquisitions completed before December 31, 2011, we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $30.7 million in cash during the next 52 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. New Accounting Standards In June of 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting standards regarding the presentation of comprehensive income (loss) in the financial statements. The new standard requires presentation of the components of net income (loss), the components of other comprehensive income (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss), either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income (loss) or in two separate but consecutive statements. The new standard eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the statement of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss). The new guidance will be effective on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk A material portion of our revenue, expenses and business activity are transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies that can affect our results of operations. In certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, Japan in particular, our revenues are benefited from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar. The opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies. In those cases, our operating expenses are benefited from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. Most of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. The fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the United States resulting from volatility in the US dollar against certain foreign currencies are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in our revenues. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net, in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets. Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures. 53 Table of Contents The following table provides information, as of December 31, 2011, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The information is provided in United States dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these forward contracts mature before or during February 2012. NotionalPrincipal WeightedAverageContractRate (In millions) Forward Contracts: Japanese yen $ 27.5 77.43 Indian rupee 12.6 53.68 British pound 12.1 1.56 European Union euro 10.7 1.32 Canadian dollar 9.8 1.03 New Taiwan dollar 6.5 30.26 Chinese Renminbi 5.0 6.36 Other 5.7 N/A Total $ 89.9 Estimated fair value $ 0.2 While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents. While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of United States interest rates. In this regard, changes in United States interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges. We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer, other than the United States of America, or the U.S. As part of our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk and sovereign debt risk of issuers other than the U.S. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk, and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor, including any sovereign debt issuer other than the U.S. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio of cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. 54 Table of Contents All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of December 31, 2011. The following table presents the carrying value and related weighted-average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified as cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011. CarryingValue AverageInterestRate (In millions) Interest-Bearing Instruments: Cash equivalents – variable rate $ 484.1 0.02% Cash – variable rate 71.7 0.29% Cash – fixed rate 9.6 6.17% Total interest-bearing instruments $ 565.4 0.16% Equity Price Risk Convertible Notes Our 2015 Notes and 2013 Notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock at conversion or at maturity of the notes. In addition, the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock. The amount of cash we may be required to pay, or the number of shares we may be required to provide to note holders at conversion or maturity of these notes, is determined by the price of our common stock. The amount of cash or number of shares that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock. For an additional description of our 2015 Notes and 2013 Notes, see Note 3 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources,” under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Investments We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program. Under this program, from time to time, we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are aligned with our strategic objectives. For an additional description of these investments, see Note 10 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $10.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and $9.3 million as of January 1, 2011. 55 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:47:21.355732
