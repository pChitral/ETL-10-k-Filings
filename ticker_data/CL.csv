21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2017,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive Overview and OutlookColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “Colgate”) seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. Approximately 75% of the Company’s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 50% of the Company’s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians. The Company’s products are also sold online through various e-commerce platforms and retailers.Through March 31, 2016, the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment included the North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific, Asia and Africa/Eurasia geographic operating segments. As a result of management changes effective April 1, 2016, the Company realigned the geographic structure of its Europe/South Pacific and Asia reportable operating segments within the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment. Management responsibility for the South Pacific operations was transferred from Europe/South Pacific management to Asia management. Accordingly, commencing with the Company’s financial reporting for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the results of the South Pacific operations are reported in the Asia Pacific reportable operating segment, which results in a slight modification to the geographic components of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment, with no impact on historical Company results overall. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure. These changes have no impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations) and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. 18(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. In addition, the Company has strengthened its capabilities in e-commerce, developing its relationships with online only retailers and its digital marketing capabilities. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products.The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. In September 2016, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary completed the sale to the United States of America of the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were previously located and received $60 as the third and final installment of the sale price. The total sale price (including the third installment and the previously received first and second installments) was $120. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $97 ($63 aftertax gain) in the third quarter of 2016, net of costs primarily related to site preparation.Effective December 31, 2015, the Company concluded it no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary (“CP Venezuela”) and began accounting for CP Venezuela using the cost method of accounting. As such, effective December 31, 2015, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet no longer includes the assets and liabilities of CP Venezuela. As a result of this change in accounting, the Company recorded an aftertax charge of $1,058 ($1,084 pretax) or $1.16 per diluted share in 2015. The charge primarily consists of an impairment of the Company’s investment in CP Venezuela of $952, which includes intercompany receivables from CP Venezuela, and $111 related to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses. Prior periods have not been restated and CP Venezuela’s Net sales, Operating profit and Net income are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income through December 31, 2015. Since January 1, 2016, under the cost method of accounting, the Company no longer includes the local operating results of CP Venezuela in its Consolidated Financial Statements and includes income relating to CP Venezuela only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to CP Venezuela or for dividends or royalties remitted by CP Venezuela, all of which have been immaterial. Although CP Venezuela’s local operating results are no longer included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting purposes, under current tax rules, the Company is required to continue including CP Venezuela in its consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. In the first quarter of 2016, Provision for income taxes included a $210 U.S. income tax benefit principally related to changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime implemented in March 2016. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Prior to the change in accounting, which was effective December 31, 2015, CP Venezuela’s functional currency was the U.S. dollar since Venezuela had been designated hyper-inflationary and, as such, Venezuelan currency fluctuations were reported in income. The Company remeasured the financial statements of CP Venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expected to remit future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, was the SICAD rate (formerly known as the SICAD I rate). During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred pretax losses of $34 ($22 aftertax or $0.02 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end SICAD rate for the second and third quarters of 2015. The SICAD rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2015 and was 13.50 bolivares per dollar as of December 31, 2015. The remeasurement losses incurred in the second and third quarters of 2015 are referred to as the “2015 Venezuela Remeasurements.” 19(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred net pretax losses of $327 ($214 aftertax or $0.23 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end SICAD I rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014 (the “2014 Venezuela Remeasurements”). The SICAD I rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and was 12.00 bolivares per dollar as of December 31, 2014.Included in the remeasurement losses during 2015 and 2014 were charges related to the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government and held by CP Venezuela. Because the official exchange rate remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar, the devaluation-protected bonds did not revalue at the SICAD rate but remained at the official exchange rate, resulting in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a Global Growth and Efficiency Program (as expanded in 2014 and 2015 as described below, the “2012 Restructuring Program”) for sustained growth. The program’s initiatives are expected to help the Company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.On October 23, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities. On October 29, 2015, the Board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program and extend it through December 31, 2017. The Board approved the implementation plan for this expansion on March 10, 2016.The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas:▪Expanding Commercial Hubs▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and FacilitiesCumulative pretax charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,405 to $1,585 ($1,050 to $1,170 aftertax). Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be approximately $430 to $495 pretax ($400 to $475 aftertax) annually once all projects are approved and implemented.In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $168, $183 and $208, respectively, associated with the 2012 Restructuring Program. For more information regarding the 2012 Restructuring Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below.In August 2015, the Company completed the sale of its laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 310 Australian dollars ($221) and recorded a pretax gain of $187 ($120 aftertax or $0.13 per diluted share) in Other (income) expense, net. The gain is net of charges related to the right-sizing of the Company’s South Pacific business, asset write-offs related to the divested laundry detergent business and other costs related to the sale. As discussed above, the funds from the sale were reinvested to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program. 20(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Looking forward, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging and category growth rates continuing to be slow. While the global marketplace in which the Company operates has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the Company does. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. In addition, the emergence of new sales channels for the Company’s products, such as e-commerce, may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics. Given that approximately 75% of the Company’s Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., the Company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs, driven by foreign exchange transaction costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results.The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brands, its broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets and initiatives, such as the 2012 Restructuring Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long term. 21(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of OperationsNet SalesWorldwide Net sales were $15,195 in 2016, down 5.0% from 2015, as net selling price increases of 2.5% were more than offset by volume declines of 3.0% and negative foreign exchange of 4.5%. Excluding divested businesses and the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, volume increased 1.5%. Organic sales (Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations), a non-GAAP financial measure as discussed below, increased 4.0% in 2016.Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment were $12,931 in 2016, down 6.5% from 2015, as net selling price increases of 2.5% were more than offset by volume declines of 4.0% and negative foreign exchange of 5.0%. Excluding divested businesses and the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, volume increased 1.5%. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment increased 4.0% in 2016.The increase in organic sales in 2016 versus 2015 was driven by an increase in Oral Care organic sales, with the toothpaste and manual toothbrush categories contributing to growth. Personal Care and Home Care also contributed to organic sales growth due to strong organic sales in the shower gel and the fabric softener categories, respectively. The Company’s share of the global toothpaste market was 44.0% for full year 2016, down 0.3 share points from full year 2015 and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 33.1% for full year 2016, down 0.3 share points from full year 2015. Full year 2016 market shares in toothpaste were up in North America and down in Europe and Asia Pacific versus full year 2015. In the manual toothbrush category, full year 2016 market shares were up in North America and Europe and down in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia versus full year 2015. For additional information regarding the Company’s use of market share data and limitations on such data, see “Market Share Information” below.Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition were $2,264 in 2016, an increase of 2.5% from 2015, driven by net selling price increases of 2.5%, while volume and foreign exchange were flat. Organic sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 2.5% in 2016.The increase in organic sales in 2016 versus 2015 was due to an increase in organic sales in the Prescription Diet category, partially offset by a decline in organic sales in the Advanced Nutrition and Natural categories.Worldwide Net sales were $16,034 in 2015, down 7.0% from 2014, as volume growth of 1.5% and net selling price increases of 3.0% were more than offset by negative foreign exchange of 11.5%. Organic sales increased 5.0% in 2015. 22(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Gross Profit/MarginWorldwide Gross profit decreased 3% to $9,123 in 2016 from $9,399 in 2015. Gross profit in both periods included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Excluding these items in both periods, Gross profit decreased to $9,169 in 2016 from $9,419 in 2015, reflecting a decrease of $492 resulting from the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015 and negative foreign exchange, partially offset by growth in organic sales. This decrease in Gross profit was partially offset by an increase of $242 resulting from higher Gross profit margin.Worldwide Gross profit margin increased to 60.0% in 2016 from 58.6% in 2015. Excluding charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program in both periods, Gross profit margin increased by 160 basis points (bps) to 60.3% in 2016, from 58.7% in 2015. This increase in Gross profit margin was primarily driven by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (190 bps) and the 2012 Restructuring Program (10 bps) and higher pricing (100 bps), partially offset by higher costs (170 bps), which included higher raw and packaging material costs driven by significant foreign exchange transaction costs and the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015.Worldwide Gross profit decreased 7% to $9,399 in 2015 from $10,109 in 2014. Gross profit in both periods included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Gross profit in 2014 also included costs related to the sale of land in Mexico. Excluding these items in both periods, Gross profit decreased to $9,419 in 2015 from $10,142 in 2014, due to lower Net sales ($730), as the growth in organic sales was more than offset by the impact of negative foreign exchange.Worldwide Gross profit margin increased to 58.6% in 2015 from 58.5% in 2014. Excluding the items described above in both periods, Gross profit margin was 58.7% in 2015, even with 2014, as cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (220 bps) and the 2012 Restructuring Program (20 bps) and higher pricing (130 bps) were offset by higher costs (370 bps), which included higher raw and packaging material costs, driven by significant foreign exchange transaction costs. 2016 2015 2014Gross profit, GAAP $9,123 $9,399 $10,1092012 Restructuring Program 46 20 29Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico — — 4Gross profit, non-GAAP $9,169 $9,419 $10,142 2016 2015 Basis Point Change 2014 Basis Point ChangeGross profit margin, GAAP 60.0% 58.6% 140 58.5% 102012 Restructuring Program 0.3 0.1 0.2 Gross profit margin, non-GAAP 60.3% 58.7% 160 58.7% — 23(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% to $5,249 in 2016 from $5,464 in 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses in both periods included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Excluding these charges in both periods, Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $5,172 in 2016 from $5,400 in 2015, reflecting decreased advertising investment of $63 and lower overhead expenses of $165.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased to 34.5% in 2016 from 34.1% in 2015. Excluding charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program in both periods, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 34.0%, an increase of 30 bps as compared to 2015. This increase in 2016 was driven by increased advertising investment (10 bps) and higher overhead expenses (20 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. In 2016, advertising investment decreased 4.2% to $1,428 as compared with $1,491 in 2015, while as a percentage of Net sales, it increased to 9.4% from 9.3% in 2015.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 9% to $5,464 in 2015 from $5,982 in 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses in both periods included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Excluding these charges, Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $5,400 in 2015 from $5,920 in 2014, reflecting decreased advertising investment of $293 and lower overhead expenses of $227.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales decreased to 34.1% in 2015 from 34.6% in 2014. Excluding the charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 33.7%, a decrease of 60 bps as compared to 2014. This decrease in 2015 was primarily driven by decreased advertising investment (100 bps), partially offset by higher overhead expenses (40 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. In 2015, advertising investment decreased 16.4% to $1,491 as compared with $1,784 in 2014, largely reflecting the impact of negative foreign exchange, and decreased as a percentage of Net sales to 9.3% from 10.3% in 2014, in part reflecting a shift from advertising investment to in-store promotional activities. 2016 2015 2014Selling, general and administrative expenses, GAAP $5,249 $5,464 $5,9822012 Restructuring Program (77) (64) (62)Selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP $5,172 $5,400 $5,920 2016 2015 Basis Point Change 2014 Basis Point ChangeSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, GAAP 34.5 % 34.1 % 40 34.6 % (50)2012 Restructuring Program (0.5) (0.4) (0.3) Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, non-GAAP 34.0 % 33.7 % 30 34.3 % (60) 24(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Other (Income) Expense, NetOther (income) expense, net was $37, $62 and $570 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Operating profit decreased 22% to $2,789 in 2015 from $3,557 in 2014. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, Operating profit included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and previously disclosed litigation matters. In 2016, Operating Profit also included a gain on sale of land in Mexico. In 2015 and 2014, Operating profit included charges related to the 2015 and 2014 Venezuela Remeasurements, respectively. In 2015, Operating profit also included a charge related to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations and a gain on the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific. In 2014, Operating profit also included costs related to the sale of land in Mexico. Excluding these items in all periods, as applicable, Operating profit in 2016 was even with 2015, primarily due to lower Gross profit which was offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating profit decreased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to lower Gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses.Operating profit margin was 25.3% in 2016, compared with 17.4% in 2015 and 20.6% in 2014. Excluding the items described above in 2016 and 2015 as applicable, Operating profit margin increased 130 bps to 26.2% in 2016 compared to 24.9% in 2015. This increase is primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (160 bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. Excluding the items described above in 2015 and 2014 as applicable, Operating profit margin increased 50 bps in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales (60 bps). 2016 2015 % Change 2014 % ChangeOperating profit, GAAP $3,837 $2,789 38 % $3,557 (22)%2012 Restructuring Program 228 254 286 Gain on sale of land in Mexico (97) — — Charges for previously disclosed litigation matters 17 14 41 Venezuela deconsolidation — 1,084 — Venezuela remeasurement charges — 34 327 Gain on sale of South Pacific laundry detergent business — (187) — Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico — — 4 Operating profit, non-GAAP $3,985 $3,988 — % $4,215 (5)% 2016 2015 Basis Point Change 2014 Basis Point ChangeOperating profit margin, GAAP 25.3 % 17.4 % 790 20.6% (320)2012 Restructuring Program 1.5 1.6 1.7 Gain on sale of land in Mexico (0.7) — — Charges for previously disclosed litigation matters 0.1 0.1 0.2 Venezuela deconsolidation — 6.8 — Venezuela remeasurement charges — 0.2 1.9 Gain on sale of South Pacific laundry detergent business — (1.2) — Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico — — — Operating profit margin, non-GAAP 26.2 % 24.9 % 130 24.4% 50 26(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest (Income) Expense, NetInterest (income) expense, net was $99 in 2016 compared with $26 in 2015 and $24 in 2014, primarily due to lower interest income on investments held outside the United States, which reflects the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015, and higher interest expense as a result of higher average interest rates on debt. The change in Interest (income) expense, net from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to higher interest expense as a result of higher debt levels.Income TaxesThe effective income tax rate was 30.8% in 2016, 44.0% in 2015 and 33.8% in 2014. As reflected in the table below, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 31.3% in 2016 and 2015 and 31.5% in 2014. 2016 Income Before Income Taxes Provision For Income Taxes(1) Effective Income Tax Rate (2)As Reported GAAP $3,738 $1,152 30.8 %2012 Restructuring Program 228 59 (0.3)Gain on sale of land in Mexico (97) (34) (0.1)Benefits from previously disclosed tax matters — 35 0.9Charges for a previously disclosed litigation matter 17 6 —Non-GAAP $3,886 $1,218 31.3 % 2015 Income Before Income Taxes Provision For Income Taxes(1) Effective Income Tax Rate (2)As Reported GAAP $2,763 $1,215 44.0 %Venezuela deconsolidation (3) 1,084 26 (11.7)2012 Restructuring Program 254 69 (0.3)Venezuela remeasurement charges 34 12 —Gain on sale of South Pacific laundry detergent business (187) (67) (0.2)Charge for a previously disclosed litigation matter 14 — (0.1)Charge for a previously disclosed tax matter — (15) (0.4)Non-GAAP $3,962 $1,240 31.3 % 2014 Income Before Income Taxes Provision For Income Taxes(1) Effective Income Tax Rate (2)As Reported GAAP $3,533 $1,194 33.8 %2012 Restructuring Program 286 78 (0.5)Venezuela remeasurement charges 327 113 0.1Charge for a previously disclosed litigation matter 41 — (0.3)Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico 4 1 —Charge for a previously disclosed tax matter — (66) (1.6)Non-GAAP $4,191 $1,320 31.5 %(1) The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.

Although, effective December 31, 2015, the operating results of CP Venezuela are no longer included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, under current tax rules, the Company is required to continue including CP Venezuela’s results in its consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. See Note 11, Income Taxes and Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In order to fully recognize the $210 tax benefit in 2016, the Company repatriated an incremental $1,500 of earnings of foreign subsidiaries it previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and accordingly, recorded a tax charge of $210 during the first quarter of 2016. In 2014, the Company received a notice of an adverse decision in the foreign court regarding a tax position it has taken since 2002. As a result, as required, the Company reassessed its tax position in light of the decision and concluded it needed to increase its unrecognized tax benefits by $30 and write off a $36 deferred tax asset. In 2015, the Company became aware of several Supreme Court rulings in the foreign jurisdiction disallowing certain tax deductions which had the effect of reversing prior decisions. Since the Company had taken deductions in prior years similar to those now disallowed by the Court, the Company, as required, reassessed its tax position and increased its unrecognized tax benefits by $15.In 2016, the Supreme Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company’s favor for the years 2002 through 2005. Also in 2016, the Administrative Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company’s favor for the years 2008 through 2011 by acknowledging the Supreme Court’s ruling for the years 2002 through 2005, which eliminated the possibility of future appeals. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $30, including interest. The tax benefit of deductions related to this tax position taken for the years 2006 through 2007 and 2012 through 2014 totals approximately $14 at current exchange rates. These deductions are currently being challenged by the tax authorities in the foreign jurisdiction either in the lower courts or at the administrative level and, if resolved in the Company’s favor, will result in the Company recording additional tax benefits, including interest.The effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the Company’s global business initiatives.

The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.Oral, Personal and Home CareNorth America 2016 2015 % Change 2014 % ChangeNet sales$3,183 $3,149 1.0% $3,124 1.0%Operating profit$1,030 $974 6% $926 5%% of Net sales32.4% 30.9% 150bps 29.6% 130bpsNet sales in North America increased 1.0% in 2016 to $3,183, driven by volume growth of 2.5%, which was partially offset by net selling price decreases of 1.0% and negative foreign exchange of 0.5%.

On October 29, 2015, the Board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program and extend it through December 31, 2017. The Board approved the implementation plan for this expansion on March 10, 2016. The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas: ▪Expanding Commercial Hubs - Building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continuing to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision-making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions - Implementing the Company’s shared service organizational model in all regions of the world. While initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services are now being expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions. ▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities - Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market. Cumulative pretax charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,405 to $1,585 ($1,050 to $1,170 aftertax). The pretax charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (10%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of related implementation charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). Over the course of the 2012 Restructuring Program, it is currently estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Anticipated pretax charges for 2017 are expected to approximate $180 to $360 ($140 to $260 aftertax). It is expected that substantially all charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program will be incurred by December 31, 2017. 36(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe (20%), Latin America (5%), Asia Pacific (5%), Africa/Eurasia (5%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (10%) and Corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is expected that, when it has been fully implemented, the 2012 Restructuring Program will contribute a net reduction of approximately 3,300 to 3,800 positions from the Company’s global employee workforce. Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $430 to $495 pretax ($400 to $475 aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. Savings in 2017 are expected to amount to approximate $40 to $60 pretax ($30 to $50 aftertax). For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, restructuring and related implementation charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: 2016 2015 2014Cost of sales $46 $20 $29Selling, general and administrative expenses 77 64 62Other (income) expense, net 105 170 195Total 2012 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $228 $254 $286 Total 2012 Restructuring Program charges, aftertax $168 $183 $208Restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

See “Executive Overview and Outlook” above for additional details. 37(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Since the inception of the 2012 Restructuring Program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has incurred cumulative pretax charges of $1,228 ($907 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows: Cumulative Charges as of December 31, 2016Employee-Related Costs$465Incremental Depreciation80Asset Impairments27Other656Total$1,228The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following projects: the implementation of the Company’s overall hubbing strategy; the consolidation of facilities; the extension of shared business services and streamlining of global functions; the simplification and streamlining of the Company’s research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain, both in Europe; the closing of the Morristown, New Jersey personal care facility; and restructuring how the Company will provide future retirement benefits to substantially all of the U.S.-based employees participating in the Company’s defined benefit retirement plan by shifting them to the Company’s defined contribution plan.The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and related implementation charges discussed above and the related accruals: Employee-RelatedCosts IncrementalDepreciation AssetImpairments Other TotalBalance at January 1, 2014 $116 $— $— $42 $158Charges 73 25 1 187 286Cash payments (95) — — (117) (212)Charges against assets (5) (25) (1) — (31)Foreign exchange (4) — — (5) (9)Other — — — — —Balance at December 31, 2014 $85 $— $— $107 $192Charges 109 20 5 120 254Cash payments (85) — — (94) (179)Charges against assets (17) (20) (5) — (42)Foreign exchange (8) — — (2) (10)Other — — — — —Balance at December 31, 2015 $84 $— $— $131 $215Charges 61 9 20 138 228Cash payments (84) — — (153) (237)Charges against assets (4) (9) (20) — (33)Foreign exchange (1) — — — (1)Other — — — 9 9Balance at December 31, 2016 $56 $— $— $125 $181Employee-Related Costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Employee-Related Costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $4, $17 and $5 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 38(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 include third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $116, $65 and $65, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $21, $8 and $40, respectively, directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are other exit costs of $1, $47 and $82, respectively, related to the consolidation of facilities. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is provided below.Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and, as applicable, excluding charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, a gain on the sale of land in Mexico, benefits from previously disclosed tax matters, a charge from a previously disclosed tax matter, charges from previously disclosed litigation matters, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico, a gain on the sale of the Company’s South Pacific laundry detergent business, charges related to effective devaluations in Venezuela and a charge for the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations. 39(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of Net sales growth to organic sales growth for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2016Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact (1)OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America1.0%(0.5)%—%1.5%Latin America(15.5)%(10.0)%(15.5)%10.0%Europe(3.0)%(3.0)%—%—%Asia Pacific(5.0)%(4.0)%(3.0)%2.0%Africa/Eurasia(4.0)%(9.5)%—%5.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care(6.5)%(5.0)%(5.5)%4.0%Pet Nutrition2.5%—%—%2.5%Total Company(5.0)%(4.5)%(4.5)%4.0%Year ended December 31, 2015Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact (1)OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America1.0%(1.0)%—%2.0%Latin America(9.5)%(19.0)%—%9.5%Europe(15.0)%(14.5)%(0.5)%—%Asia Pacific(4.5)%(6.0)%(1.5)%3.0%Africa/Eurasia(17.5)%(23.5)%—%6.0%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care(8.0)%(12.0)%(0.5)%4.5%Pet Nutrition(2.0)%(8.0)%—%6.0%Total Company(7.0)%(11.5)%(0.5)%5.0%(1) Represents the impact of acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, as applicable.Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods). Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. We believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors. 40(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, costs resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations was $3,141 in 2016, compared to $2,949 in 2015 and $3,298 in 2014. Net cash provided by operations for 2016 increased due to strong operating earnings and the timing of income tax payments, partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015 and voluntary contributions to employee postretirement plans. The decrease in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to: a decrease in Operating profit excluding a charge related to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, charges related to the 2015 and 2014 Venezuela Remeasurements, a gain on the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico and charges for previously disclosed litigation matters in both periods, as applicable; higher income tax payments; and a payment for a previously disclosed litigation matter. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (2.2)% and 0.5% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease is primarily due to the Company’s tight focus on working capital and the impact of reclassifying current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets upon the adoption of a new accounting standard. Approximately 75% of total program charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, estimated to be $1,405 to $1,585 pretax ($1,050 to $1,170 aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program are projected to be in the range of $430 to $495 pretax ($400 to $475 aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. The anticipated pretax charges for 2017 are expected to amount to approximately $180 to $360 ($140 to $260 aftertax) and savings in 2017 are expected to approximate $40 to $60 pretax ($30 to $50 aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 Restructuring Program will continue to be funded from operating cash flows. Approximately 60% of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2016 is expected to be paid before year end 2017.Investing activities used $499 of cash in 2016, compared to $685 and $859 during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2016 to $336 from $742 in 2015, due to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, a decrease in bank deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days and a decrease in purchases by the Company’s Argentinian subsidiary of U.S. dollar-linked fixed interest rate government bonds. Proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2016 to $378 from $599 in 2015, due to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations and an increase in proceeds from the redemption of bank deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days, partially offset by higher proceeds from the Company’s Argentinian subsidiary’s investment in U.S. dollar-linked fixed interest rate government bonds.In September 2016, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary completed the sale to the United States of America of the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were previously located and received $60 as the third and final installment of the sale price. The total sale price (including the third installment and the previously received first and second installments) was $120. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $97 ($63 aftertax gain) in the third quarter of 2016, net of costs primarily related to site preparation.In August 2015, the Company completed the sale of its laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 310 Australian dollars ($221) and recorded a pretax gain of $187 ($120 aftertax or $0.13 per diluted share). The gain is net of charges related to the right-sizing of the Company’s South Pacific business, asset write-offs related to the divested laundry detergent business and other costs related to the sale. As discussed above, the funds from the sale were reinvested to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program. 41(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Capital expenditures in 2016 were $593, a decrease from $691 in 2015 and $757 in 2014. Capital expenditures decreased in 2016 primarily due to lower spending on the 2012 Restructuring Program as it is entering its final stages. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2017 are expected to be approximately 4.0% of Net sales, which remains higher than the historical rate of approximately 3.5% primarily due to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Financing activities used $2,233 of cash during 2016 compared to $2,276 and $2,170 during 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in cash used in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower purchases of treasury shares and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits, partially offset by lower net proceeds from the issuance of debt. The increase in cash used in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt, higher dividends paid and higher purchases of treasury shares, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt.Long-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $6,520 as of December 31, 2016, as compared to $6,544 as of December 31, 2015 and total debt decreased to $6,533 as of December 31, 2016 as compared to $6,548 as of December 31, 2015. The Company’s debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company issued $600 of thirty-year notes at a fixed rate of 4.00%. During the second quarter of 2015 the Company issued €500 of euro-denominated four-year notes at a variable rate. The debt issuances in 2015 were under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and third quarters of 2015 were used for general corporate purposes, which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2016, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,927 (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. This facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013. In 2014, the Company entered into an amendment of this facility whereby the facility was extended for an additional year to November 2019 and the capacity of the facility was increased to $2,370. In 2016, the facility was extended for an additional year to November 2020. The Company also has the ability to draw $165 from a revolving credit facility that expires in November 2017. Commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $295 and $5 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2016 and 2015 were $1,642 and $1,989, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in November 2020.The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities OutstandingPayable to banks 1.6 % 2017 $13 1.8% 2016 $4Commercial paper (0.3)% 2017 295 —% 2016 5Total $308 $9Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities. 42(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Dividend payments in 2016 were $1,508, an increase from $1,493 in 2015 and $1,446 in 2014. Dividend payments increased to $1.55 per share in 2016 from $1.50 per share in 2015 and $1.42 per share in 2014. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company’s Board increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.39 per share from $0.38 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2016. The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On February 19, 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under a share repurchase program (the “2015 Program”), which replaced the previous program approved by the Board in 2011 (the “2011 Program”). The Company commenced repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2015 Program beginning February 19, 2015. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs.Aggregate share repurchases in 2016 consisted of 18.3 million common shares under the 2015 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,335. Aggregate repurchases in 2015 consisted of 19.9 million common shares under the 2015 Program, 1.7 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,551. Aggregate repurchases in 2014 consisted of 21.7 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.5 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,530.Cash and cash equivalents increased $345 during 2016 to $1,315 at December 31, 2016, compared to $970 at December 31, 2015, most of which ($1,273 and $932, respectively) were held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings.As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $3,400 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the Company considered such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, therefore, not subject to such taxes. In order to fully recognize a $210 U.S. income tax benefit in 2016 principally related to changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime, during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company decided to repatriate in 2016 $1,500 of earnings of foreign subsidiaries it previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and accordingly, recorded a tax charge of $210. The Company currently does not anticipate a need to repatriate additional undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Any future repatriation would be subject to applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes. As the Company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated. 43(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016: Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion(1) $5,575 $— $698 $1,025 $248 $297 $3,307Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2) 1,394 128 121 118 106 104 817Leases 860 178 160 143 130 104 145Purchase obligations(3) 820 534 141 110 24 7 4Total $8,649 $840 $1,120 $1,396 $508 $512 $4,273_______(1) The Company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next 12 months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The amounts in this table exclude such obligations.(2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(3) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2016 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2017. Management’s best estimate of voluntary contributions the Company will make to U.S. pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2017 is approximately $57. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2017 from the Company’s assets are estimated to be approximately $81.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements. 44(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.Prior to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, which was effective December 31, 2015, the functional currency for CP Venezuela was the U.S. dollar since Venezuela was designated as hyper-inflationary, and Venezuelan currency fluctuations were reported in income. The local currency-denominated non-monetary assets of the Venezuelan operations, including inventories and property, plant and equipment were remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at period-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations were included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company. Refer to “Executive Overview and Outlook” above and to Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s Venezuelan operations. The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $20 and $35 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2016, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $45.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2016 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $13 in 2016.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized losses of $0 in December 31, 2016 and 2015. At the end of 2016, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1. 45(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsOn October 24, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory,” which eliminates the requirement to defer recognition of income taxes on intra-entity transfers until the asset is sold to an outside party. The new guidance requires the recognition of current and deferred income taxes on intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, such as intellectual property and property, plant and equipment, when the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard requires a “modified retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied through a cumulative adjustment in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,” which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments are to be presented in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which amends accounting for income taxes related to share-based compensation, the related classification in the statement of cash flows and share award forfeiture accounting. This guidance requires recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies (resulting from an increase or decrease in the fair value of an award from grant date to the vesting or exercise date) in the provision for income taxes as a discrete item in the quarterly period in which they occur. Currently, excess tax benefits are recognized in equity. In addition, these amounts will be classified as an operating activity in the Statement of Cash Flows instead of as a financing activity. For the years 2014 to 2016, the Company recognized excess tax benefits in equity in the range of $55 to $63 per year. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard, as any excess tax benefits recognized would be dependent on future stock prices, employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates. The new guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017. On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, “Investments–Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting,” which eliminates the requirement to retroactively adjust an investment that subsequently qualifies for equity method accounting (as a result of an increase in level of ownership interest or degree of influence) as if the equity method of accounting had been applied during all prior periods that the investment was held. The new standard requires that the investor add the cost of acquiring additional ownership interest in the investee to its current basis and prospectively adopt the equity method of accounting. Any unrealized gains or losses in an available-for-sale investment that subsequently qualifies as an equity method investment should be recognized in earnings at the date the investment qualifies as an equity method investment. The new guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 46(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued its final standard on lease accounting, ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which supersedes Topic 840, “Leases.” The new accounting standard requires the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. The new standard also provides additional guidance on the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and will require enhanced disclosures about the Company’s leasing arrangements. Under current accounting standards, substantially all of the Company’s leases are considered operating leases and, as such, are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This new standard is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires a “modified retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied to leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements.On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments–Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The amendment to the standard is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,” which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. Under the new accounting standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be classified as noncurrent, eliminating the prior requirement to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent. As permitted, the Company early-adopted the new standard on March 31, 2016, on a prospective basis, and did not retrospectively adjust prior periods. On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, “Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) and the retail inventory method. The new guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 28, 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. The standard, issued as ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” by the FASB, provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018. During 2016, the FASB issued several accounting updates (ASU No. 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12) to clarify implementation guidance and correct unintended application of the guidance. The standard allows for either “full retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or “modified retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. The Company continues to make progress in its implementation and assessment of the new standard and while the completion of this assessment is still ongoing, based on the progress to date, the Company does not expect the new standard will have a material impact on its revenue recognition accounting policy or its Consolidated Financial Statements. 47(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in Cost of sales, Gross profit margin would have decreased by 750 bps, from 60.0% to 52.5% in 2016 and decreased by 770 bps in 2015 and 2014, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (75% of inventories) and the LIFO method (25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2016, 2015 or 2014 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves and, prior to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela.▪In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 4.27%, 4.93% and 4.24% as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 4.41%, 4.97% and 4.36% as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 6.80% as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return.Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 6%, 8%, 5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53% in fixed income securities, 27% in equity securities and 20% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $10. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $2. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans. 48(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 6.33% for 2017, declining to 4.75% by 2022 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $6.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2016 was $8.10. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 7%.▪Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. The asset impairment analysis is generally performed using an income method, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. For the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. When multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. Qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.The estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition in 2011, which were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values. ▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies. 49(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪Prior to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela required careful consideration by management given the various currency exchange mechanisms that exist in Venezuela. Although access to U.S. dollars in Venezuela had been challenging, because the majority of the products in CP Venezuela’s portfolio were designated as “essential” by the Venezuelan government, historically CP Venezuela’s access to U.S. dollars at the official rate of 6.30 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its U.S. dollar obligations for imported materials. However, the Company believed this rate was not applicable to foreign investments and could not be used to pay dividends. The Company also gave consideration to using the SIMADI rate to remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela; however, CP Venezuela did not participate in the SIMADI market through December 31, 2015 and had no intention to do so. As a result, the Company remeasured the financial statements of CP Venezuela at the rate at which it believed was applicable for the remittance of future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, was the SICAD rate.Refer to “Executive Overview and Outlook” above and to Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s Venezuelan operations.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings growth, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, cost-reduction plans including the 2012 Restructuring Program, tax rates, the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, new product introductions, commercial investment levels, acquisitions and divestitures, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain economic environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, including changes in trade, tax and immigration policies, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, the ability to implement the 2012 Restructuring Program as planned or differences between the actual and the estimated costs or savings under such program, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the ability to continue lowering costs, the ability to complete acquisitions and divestitures as planned and the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit. For information about these and other factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”ITEM 7A.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2018,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive OverviewColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “Colgate”) seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. Approximately 75% of the Company’s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 50% of the Company’s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians. Many of the Company’s products are also sold online through various e-commerce platforms and retailers.On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding, as applicable, the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. In addition, the Company has strengthened its capabilities in e-commerce, including by developing its relationships with online-only retailers and enhancing its digital marketing capabilities. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products.The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. 18(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Significant Items Impacting ComparabilityOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA” or “U.S. tax reform”) was enacted, which, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% and established a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, the TCJA also requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future tax-free repatriation of such earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction. The Company recorded a provisional charge of $275 based on its initial analysis of the TCJA using available information and estimates. As a result, applicable U.S. and foreign taxes have been provided on substantially all of the Company’s accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered indefinitely reinvested. Given the significant complexity of the TCJA, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the TCJA and the potential for additional guidance from the SEC or the FASB related to the TCJA or additional information becoming available, the Company’s provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. Other provisions of the TCJA that impact future tax years are still being assessed. Refer to “Results of Operations – Income Taxes” below for additional details. In September 2016, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary completed the sale to the United States of America of the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were previously located and received $60 as the third and final installment of the sale price. The total sale price (including the third installment and the previously received first and second installments) was $120. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $97 ($63 aftertax gain) in the third quarter of 2016, net of costs primarily related to site preparation.In August 2015, the Company completed the sale of its laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 310 Australian dollars ($221) and recorded a pretax gain of $187 ($120 aftertax or $0.13 per diluted share) in Other (income) expense, net. The gain is net of charges related to the right-sizing of the Company’s South Pacific business, asset write-offs related to the divested laundry detergent business and other costs related to the sale. Effective December 31, 2015, the Company concluded it no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary (“CP Venezuela”) and began accounting for CP Venezuela using the cost method of accounting. As such, effective December 31, 2015, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet no longer includes the assets and liabilities of CP Venezuela. As a result of this change in accounting, the Company recorded an aftertax charge of $1,058 ($1,084 pretax) or $1.16 per diluted share in 2015. The charge primarily consists of an impairment of the Company’s investment in CP Venezuela of $952, which includes intercompany receivables from CP Venezuela, and $111 related to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses. Prior periods have not been restated and CP Venezuela’s Net sales, Operating profit and Net income are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income through December 31, 2015. See Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Since January 1, 2016, under the cost method of accounting, the Company no longer includes the local operating results of CP Venezuela in its Consolidated Financial Statements and includes income relating to CP Venezuela only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to CP Venezuela or for dividends or royalties remitted by CP Venezuela, all of which have been immaterial. Although CP Venezuela’s local operating results are no longer included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting purposes, under current tax rules, the Company is required to continue including CP Venezuela in its consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. In the first quarter of 2016, Provision for income taxes included a $210 U.S. income tax benefit principally related to changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime implemented in March 2016. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Prior to the change in accounting, CP Venezuela’s functional currency was the U.S. dollar since Venezuela had been designated hyper-inflationary and, as such, Venezuelan currency fluctuations were reported in income. The Company remeasured the financial statements of CP Venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expected to remit future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, was the SICAD rate (formerly known as the SICAD I rate). During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred pretax losses of $34 ($22 aftertax or $0.02 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end SICAD rate for the second and third quarters of 2015. The SICAD rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2015 and was 13.50 bolivares per dollar as of December 31, 2015. The remeasurement losses incurred in the second and third quarters of 2015 are referred to as the “Venezuela Remeasurements.” 19(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Included in the Venezuela Remeasurements were charges related to the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government and held by CP Venezuela. Because the official exchange rate remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar, the devaluation-protected bonds did not revalue at the SICAD rate but remained at the official exchange rate, resulting in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds. The Company is in the midst of a restructuring program known as the “Global Growth and Efficiency Program,” which following the most recent expansion and extension approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on October 26, 2017, runs through December 31, 2019. The program’s initiatives are expected to help the Company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales, operating profit and earnings per share and to enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. Implementation of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program remains on track. The initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are focused on the following areas:▪Expanding Commercial Hubs▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and FacilitiesSavings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $560 to $635 pretax ($500 to $575 aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. Cumulative pretax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be in the range of $1,730 to $1,885 ($1,280 to $1,380 aftertax). In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $246, $168 and $183, respectively, associated with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. For more information regarding the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements.OutlookLooking forward, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging and category growth rates around the world to continue to be slow. While the global marketplace in which the Company operates has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the Company does. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. The Company has also been negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of its retail trade customers in key markets, such as inventory de-stocking. In addition, the growth of e-commerce has affected and continues to affect consumer preferences and market dynamics. Given that approximately 75% of the Company’s Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., the Company has experienced and may continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results. The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s key priorities: growing sales through engaging with consumers, developing world-class innovation and working with retail partners; driving efficiency on every line of the income statement to increase margins; generating strong cash flow performance and utilizing that cash effectively to enhance total shareholder returns; and leading to win by staying true to the Company’s culture and focusing on its stakeholders. The Company’s commitment to these priorities, together with the strength of the Company’s global brands, its broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets and cost-saving initiatives, such as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives and the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long term. 20(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of OperationsNet SalesWorldwide Net sales were $15,454 in 2017, up 1.5% from 2016, driven by volume growth of 0.5%, net selling price increases of 0.5% and positive foreign exchange of 0.5%.

Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment increased 1.0% in 2017.The increase in organic sales in 2017 versus 2016 was driven by an increase in Oral Care organic sales, partially offset by a decline in Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care organic sales was due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste category. The decrease in Personal Care organic sales was primarily due to declines in organic sales in the underarm protection, liquid hand soap and shampoo categories, which were partially offset by organic sales growth in the shower gel and bar soap categories. The decrease in the Home Care organic sales was primarily due to declines in organic sales in the hand dish category, partially offset by organic sales growth in the liquid cleaners and fabric conditioner categories. The Company’s share of the global toothpaste market was 43.3% for full year 2017, down 0.4 share points from full year 2016, and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 32.6% for full year 2017, down 0.5 share points from full year 2016.

The increase in Interest (income) expense, net in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher average interest rates on debt. The change in Interest (income) expense, net from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to lower interest income on investments held outside the United States, which reflects the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015, and higher interest expense as a result of higher average interest rates on debt. 25(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Income TaxesThe effective income tax rate in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 37.7%, 30.8% and 44.0%, respectively. As reflected in the table below, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 29.5% in 2017 and 31.3% in 2016 and 2015. The decrease in the non-GAAP effective income tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 is due primarily to the inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the Provision for income taxes, as discussed in more detail below. 2017 Income Before Income Taxes Provision For Income Taxes(1) Effective Income Tax Rate (2)As Reported GAAP $3,487 $1,313 37.7 %Global Growth and Efficiency Program 333 87 (1.0)U.S. tax reform — (275) (7.2)Non-GAAP $3,820 $1,125 29.5 % 2016 Income Before Income Taxes Provision For Income Taxes(1) Effective Income Tax Rate (2)As Reported GAAP $3,738 $1,152 30.8 %Global Growth and Efficiency Program 228 59 (0.3)Gain on sale of land in Mexico (97) (34) (0.1)Benefits from tax matters — 35 0.9Charge for a litigation matter 17 6 —Non-GAAP $3,886 $1,218 31.3 % 2015 Income Before Income Taxes Provision For Income Taxes(1) Effective Income Tax Rate (2)As Reported GAAP $2,763 $1,215 44.0 %Venezuela deconsolidation(3) 1,084 26 (11.7)Global Growth and Efficiency Program 254 69 (0.3)Venezuela remeasurement charges 34 12 —Gain on sale of South Pacific laundry detergent business (187) (67) (0.2)Charge for a litigation matter 14 — (0.1)Charge for a tax matter — (15) (0.4)Non-GAAP $3,962 $1,240 31.3 %_______(1) The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.

Beginning in 2018, the TCJA also requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future tax-free repatriation of such earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction. The Company’s effective income tax rate in 2017 included a provisional charge of $275 related to the TCJA using available information and estimates. The provisional charge is comprised of $451 related to the one-time deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related withholding taxes and $20 related primarily to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, which are offset by $196 of income taxes which had been previously provided for planned repatriations of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, applicable U.S. and foreign taxes have been provided on substantially all of the Company’s accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered indefinitely reinvested. Given the significant complexity of the TCJA, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the TCJA and the potential for additional guidance from the SEC or the FASB related to the TCJA or additional information becoming available, the Company’s provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. Other provisions of the TCJA that impact future tax years are still being assessed. The effective income tax rate in 2017 also included $47 of stock compensation excess tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” effective January 1, 2017. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional details.The effective income tax rate in 2016 included a $210 U.S. income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2016 principally related to changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime implemented in March 2016. Although, effective December 31, 2015, the operating results of CP Venezuela are no longer included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, under current tax rules, the Company is required to continue including CP Venezuela’s results in its consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. See Note 11, Income Taxes and Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In order to fully utilize the above mentioned $210 tax benefit in 2016, the Company repatriated an incremental $1,500 of earnings of foreign subsidiaries it previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and accordingly, recorded a tax charge of $210 during the first quarter of 2016. The Company has taken a tax position in a foreign jurisdiction since 2002 that has been challenged by the local tax authorities. In 2015, the Company became aware of several Supreme Court rulings in the foreign jurisdiction disallowing certain tax deductions which had the effect of reversing prior decisions. Since the Company had taken deductions in prior years similar to those now disallowed by the Court, the Company, as required, reassessed its tax position and increased its unrecognized tax benefits by $15.In 2016, the Supreme Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company’s favor for the years 2002 through 2005. Also in 2016, the Administrative Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company’s favor for the years 2008 through 2011 by acknowledging the Supreme Court’s ruling for the years 2002 through 2005, which eliminated the possibility of future appeals. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $30, including interest. The tax benefit of deductions related to this tax position taken for the years 2006 through 2007 and 2012 through 2014 totals approximately $16 at current exchange rates. These deductions are currently being challenged by the tax authorities in the foreign jurisdiction either in the lower courts or at the administrative level and, if resolved in the Company’s favor, will result in the Company recording additional tax benefits, including interest.The effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the Company’s global business initiatives. Reflecting U.S. tax reform, the Company expects its effective income tax rate in 2018 to be in the range of 26% to 27% both on a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. 27(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Net Income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share, dilutedNet income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company was $2,024, or $2.28 per share on a diluted basis, in 2017 compared to $2,441, or $2.72 per share on a diluted basis, in 2016 and $1,384, or $1.52 per share on a diluted basis, in 2015.

The program was expanded in 2014 and expanded and extended in 2015. Building on the Company’s successful implementation of the program, on October 26, 2017, the Board approved an expansion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and an extension of the program through December 31, 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities to streamline the Company’s operations.Initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are expected to help the Company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales, operating profit and earnings per share and to enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses, producing significant benefits in the Company’s long-term business performance. The major objectives of the program include:▪Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the Company’s operations around the world. ▪Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions. ▪Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company’s gross and operating profit.▪Building on Colgate’s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth. 36(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program continue to be focused on the following areas:▪Expanding Commercial Hubs – Building on the success of the hub structure implemented around the world, streamlining operations in order to drive smarter and faster decision-making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions – Optimizing the Company’s shared service organizational model in all regions of the world and continuing to streamline global functions to improve cost structure.▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities – Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.Implementation of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program remains on track. Savings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $560 to $635 pretax ($500 to $575 aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. Savings achieved in 2017 were in line with the Company’s previously disclosed estimate of $50 to $60 pretax ($40 to $50 aftertax). The Company expects savings in 2018 to be approximately $90 to $120 pretax ($100 to $125 aftertax). Cumulative pretax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be in the range of $1,730 to $1,885 ($1,280 to $1,380 aftertax). The Company anticipates that pretax charges for 2018 will approximate $100 to $175 ($75 to $125 aftertax). It is expected that substantially all charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program will be incurred by December 31, 2019.The pretax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (10%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of related implementation charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). Over the course of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it is currently estimated that approximately 80% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. The Company expects that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe (20%), Latin America (5%), Asia Pacific (5%), Africa/Eurasia (5%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (10%) and Corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. The Company expects that, when it has been fully implemented, the Global Growth and Efficiency Program will have contributed a net reduction of approximately 3,800 to 4,400 positions from the Company’s global employee workforce. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, restructuring and related implementation charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: 2017 2016 2015Cost of sales $75 $46 $20Selling, general and administrative expenses 89 77 64Other (income) expense, net 169 105 170Total Global Growth and Efficiency Program charges, pretax $333 $228 $254 Total Global Growth and Efficiency Program charges, aftertax $246 $168 $183Restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. 37(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Total charges incurred for the Global Growth and Efficiency Program relate to initiatives undertaken by the following reportable operating segments: Program-to-date 2017 2016 2015 Accumulated ChargesNorth America23% 35% 21% 18%Latin America2% 5% 3% 3%Europe 21% 12% 14% 22%Asia Pacific 5% 4% 4% 3%Africa/Eurasia3% 14% 5% 6%Hill’s Pet Nutrition6% 7% 5% 7%Corporate40% 23% 48% 41%Total100% 100% 100% 100%Since the inception of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has incurred cumulative pretax charges of $1,561 ($1,153 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows: Cumulative Charges as of December 31, 2017Employee-Related Costs$628Incremental Depreciation90Asset Impairments36Other807Total$1,561The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following projects: the implementation of the Company’s overall hubbing strategy; the extension of shared business services and streamlining of global functions; the consolidation of facilities; the closing of the Morristown, New Jersey personal care facility; the simplification and streamlining of the Company’s research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain, both in Europe; redesigning the European commercial organization; restructuring how the Company will provide future retirement benefits to substantially all of the U.S.-based employees participating in the Company’s defined benefit retirement plan by shifting them to the Company’s defined contribution plan; and the implementation of a Corporate efficiencies program. 38(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and related implementation charges, in the respective periods, discussed above and the related accruals: Employee-RelatedCosts IncrementalDepreciation AssetImpairments Other TotalBalance at January 1, 2015 $85 $— $— $107 $192Charges 109 20 5 120 254Cash payments (85) — — (94) (179)Charges against assets (17) (20) (5) — (42)Foreign exchange (8) — — (2) (10)Other — — — — —Balance at December 31, 2015 $84 $— $— $131 $215Charges 61 9 20 138 228Cash payments (84) — — (153) (237)Charges against assets (4) (9) (20) — (33)Foreign exchange (1) — — — (1)Other — — — 9 9Balance at December 31, 2016 $56 $— $— $125 $181Charges 163 10 9 151 333Cash payments (74) — — (170) (244)Charges against assets (21) (10) (9) — (40)Foreign exchange 3 — — 1 4Other — — — — —Balance at December 31, 2017 $127 $— $— $107 $234Employee-Related Costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Employee-Related Costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $21, $4 and $17 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. These charges for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 include third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $145, $116 and $65, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $6, $21 and $8, respectively. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are other exit costs of $0, $1 and $47, respectively, related to the consolidation of facilities. 39(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding, as applicable, the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, as applicable, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is provided below.Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding, as applicable, charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a charge related to U.S. tax reform, a gain on the sale of land in Mexico, charges or benefits from tax matters, charges for litigation matters, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico, a gain on the sale of the Company’s South Pacific laundry detergent business, charges related to effective devaluations in Venezuela and a charge for the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations (non-GAAP).These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations. 40(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of Net sales growth to organic sales growth for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2017Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America(2.0)%—%—%(2.0)%Latin America6.5%1.0%—%5.5%Europe2.0%1.0%—%1.0%Asia Pacific(0.5)%—%—%(0.5)%Africa/Eurasia2.5%3.5%—%(1.0)%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care2.0%1.0%—%1.0%Pet Nutrition1.0%0.5%—%0.5%Total Company1.5%0.5%—%1.0%Year ended December 31, 2016Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America1.0%(0.5)%—%1.5%Latin America(15.5)%(10.0)%(15.5)%10.0%Europe(3.0)%(3.0)%—%—%Asia Pacific(5.0)%(4.0)%(3.0)%2.0%Africa/Eurasia(4.0)%(9.5)%—%5.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care(6.5)%(5.0)%(5.5)%4.0%Pet Nutrition2.5%—%—%2.5%Total Company(5.0)%(4.5)%(4.5)%4.0%Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. We believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors. 41(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations was $3,054 in 2017, compared to $3,141 in 2016 and $2,949 in 2015. Net cash provided by operations for 2017 decreased as compared to 2016 primarily due to the timing of income tax payments. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to strong operating earnings and the timing of income tax payments, partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015 and voluntary contributions to employee postretirement plans.The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales increased to (2.0)% in 2017 as compared to (2.2)% in 2016, reflecting the Company’s continued tight focus on working capital. Building on the Company’s successful implementation of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, on October 26, 2017, the Board approved an expansion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and an extension of the program through December 31, 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities to streamline the Company’s operations.Implementation of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program remains on track. Including the most recent expansion, total program charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are estimated to be in the range of $1,730 to $1,885 ($1,280 to $1,380 aftertax). Approximately 80% of total program charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $560 to $635 pretax ($500 to $575 aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. Savings achieved in 2017 were in line with the Company’s previously disclosed estimate of $50 to $60 pretax ($40 to $50 aftertax).The Company anticipates that pretax charges for 2018 will approximate $100 to $175 ($75 to $125 aftertax). The Company expects savings in 2018 to amount to approximately $90 to $120 pretax ($100 to $125 aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the Global Growth and Efficiency Program will be funded from operating cash flows. Approximately 75% of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2017 is expected to be paid before year-end 2018.Investing activities used $471 of cash in 2017, compared to $499 and $685 during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Investing activities in 2017 include $44 of proceeds from the sale of property and non-core product lines, primarily related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Purchases of marketable securities and investments increased in 2017 to $347 from $336 in 2016. Proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments increased in 2017 to $391 from $378 in 2016. 42(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In September 2016, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary completed the sale to the United States of America of the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were previously located and received $60 as the third and final installment of the sale price. The total sale price (including the third installment and the previously received first and second installments) was $120. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $97 ($63 aftertax gain) in the third quarter of 2016, net of costs primarily related to site preparation.In August 2015, the Company completed the sale of its laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 310 Australian dollars ($221) and recorded a pretax gain of $187 ($120 aftertax or $0.13 per diluted share). The gain is net of charges related to the right-sizing of the Company’s South Pacific business, asset write-offs related to the divested laundry detergent business and other costs related to the sale. Capital expenditures in 2017 were $553, a decrease from $593 in 2016 and $691 in 2015. Capital expenditures decreased in 2017 primarily due to lower spending on capital projects in the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be approximately 3.5% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Financing activities used $2,450 of cash during 2017 compared to $2,233 and $2,276 during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of debt and higher purchases of treasury shares. The decrease in cash used in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower purchases of treasury shares and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower net proceeds from the issuance of debt.Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $6,566 as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $6,520 as of December 31, 2016 and total debt increased to $6,577 as of December 31, 2017 as compared to $6,533 as of December 31, 2016. The Company’s debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company issued $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.25%. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company issued $500 of thirty-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.70%. The debt issuances in 2017 were under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in 2017 were used for general corporate purposes, which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings.At December 31, 2017, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,949 (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. This facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013. In 2014, the Company entered into an amendment of this facility whereby the facility was extended for an additional year to November 2019 and the capacity of the facility was increased to $2,370. In 2016, the facility was extended for an additional year to November 2020. The Company also has the ability to draw $165 from a revolving credit facility that expires in November 2018. Commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $24 and $295 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2017 and 2016 were $1,606 and $1,642, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in November 2020. 43(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities OutstandingPayable to banks 2.8% 2018 $11 1.6 % 2017 $13Commercial paper 1.5% 2018 24 (0.3)% 2017 295Total $35 $308Certain of the agreements with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2017 were $1,529, an increase from $1,508 in 2016 and $1,493 in 2015. Dividend payments increased to $1.59 per share in 2017 from $1.55 per share in 2016 and $1.50 per share in 2015. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company’s Board increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.39 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2017. The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On February 19, 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under the 2015 Program, which replaced the previous program approved by the Board in 2011 (the “2011 Program”). The Company commenced repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2015 Program beginning February 19, 2015. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs.Aggregate share repurchases in 2017 consisted of 18.3 million common shares under the 2015 Program and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,399. Aggregate repurchases in 2016 consisted of 18.3 million common shares under the 2015 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,335. Aggregate repurchases in 2015 consisted of 19.9 million common shares under the 2015 Program, 1.7 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,551. Cash and cash equivalents increased $220 during 2017 to $1,535 at December 31, 2017, compared to $1,315 at December 31, 2016, most of which ($1,467 and $1,273, respectively) were held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, which, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% and established a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, U.S. tax reform also requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future tax-free repatriation of such earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction. As a result of the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, the Company expects a reduction in its future tax payments. For more information regarding the impact of U.S. tax reform on the Company, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below and Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 44(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In order to fully utilize a $210 U.S. income tax benefit in 2016 principally related to changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime, during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company decided to repatriate in 2016 $1,500 of earnings of foreign subsidiaries it previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and accordingly, recorded a tax charge of $210 during the first quarter of 2016. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017: Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion(1) $5,843 $— $1,097 $248 $298 $889 $3,311Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2) 1,325 119 107 104 97 83 815Leases 737 188 163 143 106 93 44Purchase obligations(3) 1,197 952 112 99 21 3 10U.S. tax reform payments 315 52 22 22 22 22 175Total $9,417 $1,311 $1,501 $616 $544 $1,090 $4,355_______(1) The Company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next 12 months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The amounts in this table exclude such obligations.(2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(3) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2017 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. Additionally, purchase obligations include the aggregate purchase price for two acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2018. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2018. Management’s best estimate of voluntary contributions the Company will make to its U.S. postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2018 is approximately $75. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2018 from the Company’s assets are estimated to be approximately $82.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. 45(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.Prior to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, which was effective December 31, 2015, the functional currency for CP Venezuela was the U.S. dollar since Venezuela was designated as hyper-inflationary, and Venezuelan currency fluctuations were reported in income. The local currency-denominated non-monetary assets of the Venezuelan operations, including inventories and property, plant and equipment were remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at period-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations were included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company. Refer to “Significant Items Impacting Comparability” above and to Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s Venezuelan operations. The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $9 and a net unrealized gain of $20 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2017, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $79. 46(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2017 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $7 in 2017.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, were not material and would not have resulted in a material net unrealized loss at December 31, 2017 had there been an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsOn August 28, 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities,” amending the eligibility criteria for hedged items and transactions to expand an entity’s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and present hedge ineffectiveness and aligns the presentation of hedge gains and losses with the underlying hedge item. The new guidance also simplifies the hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The amended presentation and disclosure requirements must be adopted on a prospective basis, while any amendments to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption must be applied on a “modified retrospective” basis, meaning a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On May 10, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting,” clarifying when a change to the terms or conditions of a stock-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. The new guidance requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award. The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018. This new guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted. 47(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On March 10, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation–Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost,” changing the presentation of the net periodic benefit cost on the Statement of Income and limiting the amount of net periodic benefit cost eligible for capitalization to assets. The new guidance permits only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The new guidance also requires entities to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost together with compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. Other components of net periodic benefit cost, which include interest, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses, are required to be presented outside of Operating profit. The line item or items used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if not separately described on the Statement of Income. The new presentation requirement is required to be adopted on a “full retrospective” basis, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented in the financial statements, while the limitation on capitalization can only be adopted on a prospective basis. The new guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018. Had the standard been effective for the year ended December 31, 2017, full year Operating profit would have increased by approximately $120 with no impact on Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company. The Company anticipates that in future years, as a result of the reclassification, Operating profit will increase by approximately $100 annually with no impact on Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles–Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standard is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On January 5, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business,” which provides additional guidance on evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The guidance requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the new guidance would define this as an asset acquisition; otherwise, the entity then evaluates whether the asset meets the requirement that a business include, at a minimum, an input and substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On October 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory,” which eliminates the requirement to defer recognition of income taxes on intra-entity asset transfers until the asset is sold to an outside party. The new guidance requires the recognition of current and deferred income taxes on intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, such as intellectual property and property, plant and equipment, when the transfer occurs. As permitted, the Company early-adopted the new standard on a “modified retrospective” basis, meaning the standard was applied only to the most recent period presented in the financial statements, as of January 1, 2017. This new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,” which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments are to be presented in the statement of cash flows. The guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 48(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which amended accounting for income taxes related to stock-based compensation, the related classification in the statement of cash flows and share award forfeiture accounting. The new guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017. As required subsequent to the adoption of this new guidance, the Company recognized excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $47 (resulting from an increase in the fair value of an award from grant date to the vesting or exercise date, as applicable) in the Provision for income taxes as a discrete item during the year ended December 31, 2017. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized as any excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation recognized would be dependent on future stock price, employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates. Prior to January 1, 2017, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were recognized in equity. As permitted, the Company elected to classify these excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as an operating activity in the Statement of Cash Flows instead of as a financing activity on a prospective basis and did not retrospectively adjust prior periods. Also, as permitted by the new standard, the Company elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, “Investments–Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting,” which eliminated the requirement to retroactively adjust an investment that subsequently qualifies for equity method accounting (as a result of an increase in level of ownership interest or degree of influence) as if the equity method of accounting had been applied during all prior periods that the investment was held. The new standard requires that the investor add the cost of acquiring additional ownership interest in the investee to its current basis and prospectively apply the equity method of accounting. For an available-for-sale investment, any unrealized gains or losses should be recognized in earnings at the date the investment qualifies as an equity method investment. The new guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017, and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued its final standard on lease accounting, ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which supersedes Topic 840, “Leases.” The new accounting standard requires the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. The new standard also provides additional guidance on the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and will require enhanced disclosures about the Company’s leasing arrangements. Under current accounting standards, substantially all of the Company’s leases are considered operating leases and, as such, are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This new standard is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires a “modified retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied to leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements.On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments–Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The amendment to the standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, “Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) and the retail inventory method. The new guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017. This new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 49(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On May 28, 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. The standard, issued as ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” by the FASB, provides a comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to its customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also includes enhanced disclosures. During 2016, the FASB issued several accounting updates (ASU No. 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12) to clarify implementation guidance and correct unintended application of the guidance. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018, on a “modified retrospective” basis, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Although the new standard resulted in changes to the Company’s revenue recognition accounting policy commencing on January 1, 2018, the Company does not expect it will have a material impact in future periods on its Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in Cost of sales, Gross profit margin would have decreased by 760 bps, from 60.0% to 52.4% in 2017 and decreased by 750 bps in 2016 and 2015, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (75% of inventories) and the LIFO method (25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2017, 2016 or 2015 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. 50(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, the provisional charge in 2017 related to U.S. tax reform, legal and other contingency reserves and, prior to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela.▪In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 3.73%, 4.27% and 4.93% as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 3.80%, 4.41% and 4.97% as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 6.60% as of December 31, 2017 and 6.80% as of December 2016 and 2015. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return.Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 14%, 8%, 6%, 8% and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53% in fixed income securities, 27% in equity securities and 20% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $14. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $2. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 6.00% for 2018, declining to 4.75% by 2023 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $7.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.37. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 7%. 51(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. The asset impairment analysis is generally performed using an income method, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. For the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. When multiple valuation methodologies are used in a reporting unit’s goodwill impairment analysis, the Company performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results. Other qualitative factors the Company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.The estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition in 2011, which were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. The Company applies the ‘relief from royalty method’ to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition (the “Sanex intangible assets”). Under this method, the fair value of an intangible asset is calculated as the present value of future royalty savings generated as a result of owning the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in determining the Company’s estimate of the fair value of the Sanex intangible assets include royalty rates, discount rates and long-term revenue growth rates. Estimating long-term revenue growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, product pricing and consumer tastes and preferences. In determining an appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that the fair value of the Sanex intangible assets exceeded their carrying value by more than 10% and concluded that such excess was reasonable considering the brand’s relatively recent acquisition. Based on this, the brand’s recent performance and the Company’s future plans for it, the Company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to the Sanex intangible assets.Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values. ▪On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, which, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% and established a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. U.S. tax reform also requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future tax-free repatriation of such earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction. In accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, and Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, the Company recorded a provisional charge of $275 based on its initial analysis of the TCJA using available information and estimates. The provisional charge is comprised of $451 related to the one-time deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related withholding taxes and $20 related primarily to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, which are offset by $196 of income taxes which had been previously provided for planned repatriations of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, applicable U.S. and foreign taxes have been provided on substantially all of the Company’s accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered indefinitely reinvested.Given the significant complexity of the TCJA, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the TCJA and the potential for additional guidance from the SEC or the FASB related to the TCJA or additional information becoming available, the Company’s provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. Other provisions of the TCJA that impact future tax years are still being assessed. 52(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.▪Prior to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela required careful consideration by management given the various currency exchange mechanisms that exist in Venezuela. Although access to U.S. dollars in Venezuela had been challenging, because the majority of the products in CP Venezuela’s portfolio were designated as “essential” by the Venezuelan government, historically CP Venezuela’s access to U.S. dollars at the official rate of 6.30 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its U.S. dollar obligations for imported materials. However, the Company believed this rate was not applicable to foreign investments and could not be used to pay dividends. The Company also gave consideration to using the SIMADI rate to remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela; however, CP Venezuela did not participate in the SIMADI market through December 31, 2015 and had no intention to do so. As a result, the Company remeasured the financial statements of CP Venezuela at the rate at which it believed was applicable for the remittance of future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, was the SICAD rate.Refer to “Significant Items Impacting Comparability” above and to Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s Venezuelan operations.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies. 53(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings per share growth, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, cost-reduction plans including the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, tax rates, U.S. tax reform, new product introductions, commercial investment levels, acquisitions and divestitures, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain economic environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, foreign currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws, or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, including changes in trade, tax and immigration policies, disruptions in global supply chain, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, the ability to implement the Global Growth and Efficiency Program as planned or differences between the actual and the estimated costs or savings under such program, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the emergence of new sales channels, the growth of e-commerce, the ability to continue lowering costs, the ability to complete acquisitions and divestitures as planned, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, and the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit. For information about these and other factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”ITEM 7A.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2019,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive OverviewColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “Colgate”) seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which the Company competes, the Company prioritizes its efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. Approximately 70% of the Company’s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 50% of the Company’s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of traditional and e-commerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and e-commerce retailers. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding, as applicable, the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which can then be rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin care professionals and traditional and e-commerce retailers. In addition, the Company has enhanced its digital marketing capabilities and intends to broaden its e-commerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products.The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. 20(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Significant Items Impacting ComparabilityIn January 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Physicians Care Alliance, LLC (“PCA Skin”) and Elta MD Holdings, Inc. (“Elta MD”), professional skin care businesses, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $730. With these acquisitions, the Company entered the professional skin care category, which complements its existing global personal care businesses.

Beginning in 2018, the TCJA also requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future tax-free repatriation of such earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction. As a result of the enactment of the TCJA, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional charge of $275 based on its initial analysis of the TCJA using information and estimates available as of February 15, 2018, the date on which the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company finalized its assessment of the impact of the TCJA and recognized an additional tax expense of $80 reflecting the impact of transition tax guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the update of certain estimates and calculations based on information available through the end of 2018. Any further guidance issued after December 31, 2018 may have an impact to the Company’s Provision for income tax in the period such guidance is effective. Refer to “Results of Operations–Income Taxes” below for additional details.In September 2016, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary completed the sale to the United States of America of the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were previously located and received $60 as the third and final installment of the sale price. The total sale price (including the third installment and the previously received first and second installments) was $120. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $97 ($63 aftertax) in the third quarter of 2016, net of costs primarily related to site preparation.Effective December 31, 2015, the Company concluded it no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary (“CP Venezuela”) and began accounting for CP Venezuela using the cost method of accounting.Since January 1, 2016, under the cost method of accounting, the Company no longer includes the local operating results of CP Venezuela in its Consolidated Financial Statements and includes income relating to CP Venezuela only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to CP Venezuela or for dividends or royalties remitted by CP Venezuela, all of which have been immaterial. Although CP Venezuela’s local operating results are no longer included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting purposes, under current tax rules, the Company is required to continue including CP Venezuela in its consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. In the first quarter of 2016, Provision for income taxes included a $210 U.S. income tax benefit principally related to changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime implemented in March 2016. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Company’s restructuring program known as the “Global Growth and Efficiency Program” runs through December 31, 2019. The program’s initiatives are expected to help the Company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales, operating profit and earnings per share and to enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. Implementation of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program remains on track and is in its final year. The initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are focused on the following areas:▪Expanding Commercial Hubs▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and FacilitiesSavings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $590 to $635 pretax ($550 to $575 aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. Cumulative pretax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be in the range of $1,820 to $1,870 ($1,350 to $1,380 aftertax). 21(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $125, $246 and $168, respectively, resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. For more information regarding the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Effective January 1, 2018, as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-07, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost,” on a retrospective basis. As a result, for all periods presented, only the service related component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs is included in Operating profit. The non-service related components (interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of actuarial gains and losses) are included in a new line item, “Non-service related postretirement costs,” which is below Operating profit. Adoption of this standard had no effect on Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company, Earnings per common share or Cash flow. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.As a result of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 “Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” effective January 1, 2017, the Company recognizes excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation (resulting from an increase in the fair value of an award from the grant date to the vesting or exercise date, as applicable) in the Provision for income taxes as a discrete item. Prior to January 1, 2017, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were recognized in equity.OutlookLooking forward, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain challenging. While the Company has recently seen improvement in category growth rates, the Company expects category growth rates to remain below prior historical levels. While the global marketplace in which the Company operates has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the Company does. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. The Company has also been negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of its retail trade customers in key markets, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space or delisting of the Company’s products. In addition, the retail landscape in many of the Company’s markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of e-commerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and the emergence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. This rapid growth in e-commerce and emergence of alternative retail channels may create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect the Company’s relationships with its key retailers. In addition, given that approximately 70% of the Company’s Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., the Company has experienced and may continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results. In summary, the Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s key priorities: growing sales through engaging with consumers, developing world-class innovation and working with retail partners; driving efficiency on every line of the income statement to increase margins; generating strong cash flow performance and utilizing that cash effectively to enhance total shareholder return; and leading to win by staying true to the Company’s culture and focusing on its stakeholders. The Company’s commitment to these priorities, together with the strength of the Company’s global brands, its broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets and cost-saving initiatives, such as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives and the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long term. 22(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of OperationsNet SalesWorldwide Net sales were $15,544 in 2018, up 0.5% from 2017, as volume growth of 1.0% and net selling price increases of 0.5% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 1.0%.

The increase in Oral Care organic sales was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste category. The increase in the Home Care organic sales was primarily due to organic sales growth in the liquid cleaners and fabric softener categories. The decrease in Personal Care organic sales was due to declines in organic sales in the bar soap and underarm protection categories, which were partially offset by organic sales growth in the shower gel category. The Company’s share of the global toothpaste market was 42.0% for full year 2018, down 1.3 share points from full year 2017, and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 32.3% for full year 2018, down 0.7 share points from full year 2017.

The decrease in the non-GAAP effective income tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA, as discussed in more detail below. The decrease in the non-GAAP effective income tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to the inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the Provision for income taxes, as discussed in more detail below. 2018 Income Before Income Taxes Provision For Income Taxes(1) Effective Income Tax Rate(2)As Reported GAAP $3,464 $906 26.2 %Global Growth and Efficiency Program 161 37 (0.1)Benefit from a foreign tax matter — 15 0.4U.S. tax reform — (80) (2.3)Non-GAAP $3,625 $878 24.2 % 2017 Income Before Income Taxes Provision For Income Taxes(1) Effective Income Tax Rate(2)As Reported GAAP $3,487 $1,313 37.7 %Global Growth and Efficiency Program 333 87 (1.0)U.S. tax reform — (275) (7.2)Non-GAAP $3,820 $1,125 29.5 % 2016 Income Before Income Taxes Provision For Income Taxes(1) Effective Income Tax Rate(2)As Reported GAAP $3,738 $1,152 30.8 %Global Growth and Efficiency Program 228 59 (0.3)Gain on sale of land in Mexico (97) (34) (0.1)Benefits from tax matters — 35 0.9Charges for a litigation matter 17 6 —Non-GAAP $3,886 $1,218 31.3 %_______(1) The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.

Beginning in 2018, the TCJA also requires a minimum tax on certain earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for tax-free repatriation of such earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction. The Company’s effective income tax rate in 2017 included a provisional charge of $275, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, based on its initial analysis of the TCJA using information and estimates available as of February 15, 2018, the date on which the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company finalized its assessment of the impact of the TCJA and recognized an additional tax expense of $80 reflecting the impact of transition tax guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the update of certain estimates and calculations based on information available through the end of 2018. Any further guidance issued after December 31, 2018 may have an impact to the Company’s Provision for income tax in the period such guidance is effective. The effective income tax rate in 2018 and 2017 also included $12 and $47, respectively, of stock compensation excess tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” effective January 1, 2017. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional details.The effective income tax rate in 2016 included a $210 U.S. income tax benefit principally related to changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime implemented in March 2016. In order to fully utilize the $210 tax benefit in 2016, the Company repatriated an incremental $1,500 of earnings of foreign subsidiaries it previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and accordingly, recorded a tax charge of $210. The Company had taken a tax position in a foreign jurisdiction since 2002 that was challenged by the local tax authorities. In 2016, the Supreme Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company’s favor for the years 2002 through 2005. Also in 2016, the Administrative Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company’s favor for the years 2008 through 2011 by acknowledging the Supreme Court’s ruling for the years 2002 through 2005, which eliminated the possibility of future appeals. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $30, including interest, in 2016.In March 2018, the lower courts ruled in the Company’s favor for the years 2006, 2007 and 2012 through 2014. The deadline for the local tax authorities to appeal has now passed, and the Company considers all outstanding disputes on this matter resolved. As a result, the Company recorded an additional tax benefit of $15, including interest.The effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the Company’s global business initiatives. The Company expects its effective income tax rate in 2019 to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5% both on a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program.Net Income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share, dilutedNet income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company was $2,400, or $2.75 per share on a diluted basis, in 2018 compared to $2,024, or $2.28 per share on a diluted basis, in 2017 and $2,441, or $2.72 per share on a diluted basis, in 2016.

The program runs through December 31, 2019.Initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are expected to help the Company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales, operating profit and earnings per share and to enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses, producing significant benefits in the Company’s long-term business performance. The major objectives of the program include:▪Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the Company’s operations around the world. ▪Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions. ▪Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company’s gross and operating profit.▪Building on Colgate’s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth. 37(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program continue to be focused on the following areas:▪Expanding Commercial Hubs – Building on the success of the hub structure implemented around the world, streamlining operations in order to drive smarter and faster decision-making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions – Optimizing the Company’s shared service organizational model in all regions of the world and continuing to streamline global functions to improve cost structure.▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities – Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.Implementation of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program remains on track and is in its final year. Savings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $590 to $635 pretax ($550 to $575 aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. Savings achieved in 2018 were in line with the Company’s previously disclosed estimate of $90 to $120 pretax ($100 to $125 aftertax). The Company expects savings in 2019 to be approximately $25 to $55 pretax ($40 to $60 aftertax). Cumulative pretax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be in the range of $1,820 to $1,870 ($1,350 to $1,380 aftertax). The Company anticipates that pretax charges for 2019 will approximate $100 to $150 ($70 to $100 aftertax). It is expected that substantially all charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program will be incurred by December 31, 2019.The pretax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (45%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (5%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of related implementation charges resulting directly from exit activities (30%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). Over the course of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it is currently estimated that approximately 80% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. The Company expects that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe (20%), Latin America (5%), Asia Pacific (5%), Africa/Eurasia (5%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (10%) and Corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. The Company expects that, when it has been fully implemented, the Global Growth and Efficiency Program will have contributed a net reduction of approximately 4,000 to 4,400 positions from the Company’s global employee workforce.

Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments are recorded to write down inventories and assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. These charges for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 include third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $42, $145 and $116, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $48, $6 and $21, respectively. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are other exit costs of $0, $0 and $1, respectively, related to the consolidation of facilities. 40(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, as applicable, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is provided below.Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding, as applicable, charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a benefit from a foreign tax matter, charges related to U.S. tax reform, a gain on the sale of land in Mexico, benefits from tax matters and charges for a litigation matter (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations. 41(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of Net sales growth to organic sales growth for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2018Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America7.5%—%5.0%2.5%Latin America(7.5)%(6.5)%—%(1.0)%Europe4.5%4.0%—%0.5%Asia Pacific(1.5)%—%—%(1.5)%Africa/Eurasia(1.5)%(4.0)%—%2.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care—%(1.5)%1.5%—%Pet Nutrition4.0%0.5%—%3.5%Total Company0.5%(1.0)%1.0%0.5%Year ended December 31, 2017Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America(2.0)%—%—%(2.0)%Latin America6.5%1.0%—%5.5%Europe2.0%1.0%—%1.0%Asia Pacific(0.5)%—%—%(0.5)%Africa/Eurasia2.5%3.5%—%(1.0)%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care2.0%1.0%—%1.0%Pet Nutrition1.0%0.5%—%0.5%Total Company1.5%0.5%—%1.0%Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. We believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors. 42(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations was $3,056 in 2018, compared to $3,054 in 2017 and $3,141 in 2016. Net cash provided by operations for 2018 increased as compared to 2017 primarily due to lower income tax payments, partially offset by an increase in working capital. The decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the timing of income tax payments.The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company continues to be tightly focused on working capital. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (1.7)% in 2018 as compared to (2.0)% in 2017.In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. The program was expanded in 2014 and expanded and extended in each of 2015 and 2017. The program runs through December 31, 2019.Implementation of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program remains on track and is in its final year. Including the most recent expansion, total program charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are estimated to be in the range of $1,820 to $1,870 ($1,350 to $1,380 aftertax). Approximately 80% of total program charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $590 to $635 pretax ($550 to $575 aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. Savings achieved in 2018 were in line with the Company’s previously disclosed estimate of $90 to $120 pretax ($100 to $125 aftertax).The Company anticipates that pretax charges for 2019 will approximate $100 to $150 ($70 to $100 aftertax). The Company expects savings in 2019 to amount to approximately $25 to $55 pretax ($40 to $60 aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the Global Growth and Efficiency Program will be funded from operating cash flows. Approximately 70% of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2018 is expected to be paid before year-end 2019.Investing activities used $1,170 of cash in 2018, compared to $471 and $499 during 2017 and 2016, respectively. Investing activities in 2018 include the Company’s acquisition of the outstanding equity interests of PCA Skin and Elta MD, professional skin care businesses, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $730. Purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2018 to $169 from $347 in 2017. Proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2018 to $156 from $391 in 2017. In September 2016, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary completed the sale to the United States of America of the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were previously located and received $60 as the third and final installment of the sale price. The total sale price (including the third installment and the previously received first and second installments) was $120. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $97 ($63 aftertax) in the third quarter of 2016, net of costs primarily related to site preparation.Capital expenditures in 2018 were $436, a decrease from $553 in 2017 and $593 in 2016. Capital expenditures decreased in 2018 primarily due to lower spending on manufacturing facilities and capital projects related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Capital expenditures for 2019 are expected to be approximately 2.5% to 3.0% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. 43(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Financing activities used $2,679 of cash during 2018 compared to $2,450 and $2,233 during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher net payments on debt and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The increase in cash used in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of debt and higher purchases of treasury shares.Long-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $6,354 as of December 31, 2018, as compared to $6,566 as of December 31, 2017 and total debt decreased to $6,366 as of December 31, 2018 as compared to $6,577 as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company issued $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.25%. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company issued $500 of thirty-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.70%. The debt issuances in 2017 were under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in 2017 were used for general corporate purposes, which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings.At December 31, 2018, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,023 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2018, the Company amended and restated its five-year revolving credit facility, on substantially similar terms, for a five-year term expiring November 2023 and increasing the facility’s capacity to $2,650. Commitment fees related to the credit facility are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $534 and $24 as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2018 and 2017 were $1,773 and $1,606, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in November 2023. The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities OutstandingPayable to banks 5.3% 2019 $12 2.8% 2018 $11Commercial paper 2.5% 2019 534 1.5% 2018 24Total $546 $35Certain of the agreements with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2018 were $1,591, an increase from $1,529 in 2017 and $1,508 in 2016. Dividend payments increased to $1.66 per share in 2018 from $1.59 per share in 2017 and $1.55 per share in 2016. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s Board increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.42 per share from $0.40 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2018. The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On June 18, 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under the 2018 Program, which replaced a previously authorized share repurchase program. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs. The shares are repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the Company’s discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors. 44(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Aggregate share repurchases in 2018 consisted of 8.9 million common shares under the 2018 Program, 8.7 million common shares under the 2015 Program and 1.1 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,238. Aggregate repurchases in 2017 consisted of 18.3 million common shares under the 2015 Program and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,399. Aggregate repurchases in 2016 consisted of 18.3 million common shares under the 2015 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,335. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $809 during 2018 to $726 at December 31, 2018, compared to $1,535 at December 31, 2017, primarily due to the acquisitions of PCA Skin and Elta MD and reduced levels of debt. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries was $651 and $1,467, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017.In 2016, in order to fully utilize a $210 U.S. income tax benefit principally related to changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime, the Company decided to repatriate $1,500 of earnings of foreign subsidiaries it previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and accordingly, recorded a tax charge of $210. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018: Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion(1) $4,748 $— $249 $298 $886 $893 $2,422Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2) 1,993 148 143 136 121 92 1,353Leases 666 193 165 123 102 51 32Purchase obligations(3) 440 179 151 96 4 2 8U.S. tax reform payments 219 — — 9 25 46 139Total $8,066 $520 $708 $662 $1,138 $1,084 $3,954_______(1) The Company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next 12 months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The amounts in this table exclude such obligations.(2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(3) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2018 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2019. Management’s best estimate of voluntary contributions the Company will make to its U.S. postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2019 is approximately $100. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2019 from the Company’s assets are estimated to be approximately $61.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. 45(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $9 and a net unrealized loss of $9 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2018, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $69. 46(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2018 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $19 in 2018.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.At December 31, 2018 and 2017 the Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, were not material. At the end of 2018, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-15, “Intangibles–Goodwill and Other–Internal–Use Software (Topic 350): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.” This new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. This new guidance is effective for the Company on a prospective or retrospective basis beginning on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to adopt this guidance early, beginning on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis and does not expect the guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation–Retirement Benefits–Defined Benefit Plans–General (Topic 715): Disclosure Framework–Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.” This new guidance removes certain disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures and requires certain additional disclosures. This new guidance is effective for the Company on a retrospective basis beginning in the year ending December 31, 2020, with early adoption permitted. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 47(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” This new guidance removes certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifies existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adds new disclosure requirements. The new disclosure requirements include disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Certain disclosure requirements in the new guidance will need to be applied on a retrospective basis and others on a prospective basis. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, “Income Statement–Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (“ASU 2018-02”), which permits the reclassification of stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA” or “U.S. tax reform”) from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Retained earnings. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and must be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to periods in which the effects of the TCJA are recognized. The Company elected to adopt this new guidance early, beginning on January 1, 2018, and reclassified $163 during the first quarter of 2018.In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities,” amending the eligibility criteria for hedged items and transactions to expand an entity’s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and present hedge ineffectiveness and aligns the presentation of hedge gains and losses with the underlying hedge item. The new guidance also simplifies the hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The amended presentation and disclosure requirements must be adopted on a prospective basis, while any amendments to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption must be applied on a “modified retrospective” basis, meaning a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-16, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) Overnight Index Swap (“OIS”) Rate as Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes.” The new guidance permits use of the OIS rate based on the SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019, concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2017-12, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance is required to be applied on a prospective basis. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting,” clarifying when a change to the terms or conditions of a stock-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. The new guidance requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award. The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or the conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted. 48(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation–Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost,” changing the presentation of the net periodic benefit cost on the Statement of Income and limiting the amount of net periodic benefit cost eligible for capitalization to assets. The new guidance permits only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The new guidance also requires entities to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost together with compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The non-service related components of net periodic benefit cost, which include interest, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses, are required to be presented outside of Operating profit. The line item or items used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if not separately described on the Statement of Income. The new presentation requirement was adopted on a “full retrospective” basis, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented in the financial statements, while the limitation on capitalization was adopted on a prospective basis. Effective January 1, 2018, as required, the Company adopted this standard on a retrospective basis. As permitted by the new guidance, the Company used the amounts disclosed in its pension and other postretirement benefit plan note for the prior comparative periods as the basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements. As a result, for all periods presented, only the service related component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs is included in Operating profit. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company reclassified $118 and $118, respectively, of non-service related components of pension and other postretirement costs, which was previously deducted from Operating profit, to a new line item, “Non-service related postretirement costs,” which is below Operating profit. Adoption of this standard had no effect on Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company, Earnings per common share or Cash flow.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles–Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standard is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business,” which provides additional guidance on evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The guidance requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the new guidance would define this as an asset acquisition; otherwise, the entity then evaluates whether the asset meets therequirement that a business include, at a minimum, an input and substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018. This new guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,” which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments are to be presented in the statement of cash flows. The guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. This new guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 49(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In February 2016, the FASB issued its final standard on lease accounting, ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which superseded Topic 840, “Leases.” The new accounting standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and required the recognition on the balance sheet of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases, and enhanced disclosures about the Company’s leasing arrangements. Substantially all of the Company’s leases are considered operating leases and, as such, under accounting standards in effect at December 31, 2018, were not recognized on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” to clarify the implementation guidance and ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements.” This updated guidance provided an optional transition method, which allows for the initial application of the new accounting standard at the adoption date and the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted the new standard beginning on January 1, 2019 and elected the optional transition method with no restatement of prior period amounts. As allowed under the new accounting standard, the Company elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations, lease classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption. The Company also elected not to separate lease components from non-lease components and to exclude short-term leases from its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s adoption of the new standard is expected to result in the recognition of right-of-use assets of approximately $450 and liabilities of approximately $575, with no material cumulative effect adjustment to its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the date of adoption. Adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income or Cash Flows. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments–Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The amendment to the standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. The standard, issued as ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” by the FASB, provides a comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to its customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also includes enhanced disclosures. During 2016, the FASB issued several accounting updates (ASU No. 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12) to clarify implementation guidance and correct unintended application of the guidance. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018, on a “modified retrospective” basis, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. As required, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings. Results for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the prior accounting guidance under Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition.”Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 50(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and inventories.▪The Company accounts for shipping and handling costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports such costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses.Prior to ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which the Company adopted on January 1, 2018, shipping and handling costs could be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. Prior to 2018, the Company also reported such costs as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin was not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in Cost of sales, the Company’s Gross profit margin would have decreased by 760 bps and 750 bps in 2017 and 2016, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (75% of inventories) and the LIFO method (25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2018, 2017 or 2016 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves.▪In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 4.38%, 3.73% and 4.27% as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 4.43%, 3.80% and 4.41% as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 6.60% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and 6.80% as of December 31, 2016. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return.Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were (5)%, 5%, 8%, 6% and 7%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 60% in fixed income securities, 22% in equity securities and 18% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $12. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $3. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 6.00% for 2019, declining to 4.75% by 2024 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $7. 51(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $9.48. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 8%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 5%.▪Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. The asset impairment analysis is generally performed using an income method, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. For the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. When multiple valuation methodologies are used in a reporting unit’s goodwill impairment analysis, the Company performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results. Other qualitative factors the Company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.The estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition in 2011 and the PCA Skin and Elta MD acquisitions in 2018, which were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. The Company applies the ‘relief from royalty method’ to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition (the “Sanex intangible assets”). Under this method, the fair value of an intangible asset is calculated as the present value of future royalty savings generated as a result of owning the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in determining the Company’s estimate of the fair value of the Sanex intangible assets include royalty rates, discount rates and long-term revenue growth rates. Estimating long-term revenue growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, product pricing and consumer tastes and preferences. In determining an appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that the fair value of the Sanex intangible assets exceeded their carrying value by more than 10% and concluded that such excess was reasonable considering the brand’s relatively recent acquisition. Based on this, the brand’s recent performance and the Company’s future plans for it, the Company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to the Sanex intangible assets. Given the recent acquisitions of PCA Skin and Elta MD, the performance of PCA Skin and Elta MD since acquisition and the Company’s future plans for these brands, the Company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to either PCA Skin’s and Elta MD’s intangible assets.Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values. 52(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, which, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% and established a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, the TCJA also requires a minimum tax on certain earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for tax-free repatriation of such earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction. The Company’s effective income tax rate in 2017 included a provisional charge of $275, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, based on its initial analysis of the TCJA using information and estimates available as of February 15, 2018, the date on which the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The provisional charge was comprised of $451 related to the one-time deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related withholding taxes and $20 related primarily to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, which were offset by $196 of income taxes which had been previously provided for planned repatriations of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, applicable U.S. and foreign taxes have been provided on substantially all of the Company’s accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered indefinitely reinvested.During 2018, the Company finalized its assessment of the impact of the TCJA and recognized an additional tax expense of $80 reflecting the impact of transition tax guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the update of certain estimates and calculations based on information available through the end of 2018. Any further guidance issued after December 31, 2018 may have an impact to the Company’s Provision for income tax in the period such guidance is effective. ▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies. 53(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings per share growth, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, cost-reduction plans including the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, tax rates, U.S. tax reform, new product introductions, commercial investment levels, acquisitions and divestitures, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain economic environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, foreign currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws, or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, including changes in trade, tax and immigration policies, disruptions in global supply chain, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, the ability to implement the Global Growth and Efficiency Program as planned or differences between the actual and the estimated costs or savings under such program, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the emergence of new sales channels, the growth of e-commerce and the changing retail landscape, the ability to continue lowering costs, the ability to complete acquisitions and divestitures as planned, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, and the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit. For information about these and other factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”ITEM 7A.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2020,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive OverviewColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” the “Company” or “Colgate”) seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.To this end, we are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.Operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approximately 70% of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 50% of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors. Through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding, the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the Company's use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and ""Market Share Information"" below.To achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on innovating our core businesses; improving our brand building activities with an elevated brand purpose model and the use of equity advertising; innovating to gain market share in high growth segments and adjacencies; expanding into new channels and markets; maximizing growth online; and investing to drive consumption in growing populations. We continue to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. In addition, we continue to invest behind our brands, not just in terms of advertising, but also to build key growth capabilities in areas such as innovation and data and analytics. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products. We are also working to integrate our sustainability strategy across our organization.We are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation. 20(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health. 21(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Significant Items Impacting ComparabilityOn September 19, 2019, the Company acquired Laboratoires Filorga Cosmétiques S.A. (“Filorga”), a skin health business, for cash consideration of €1,548 (approximately $1,712). Filorga is a premium anti-aging skin health brand focused primarily on facial care. The acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash. This acquisition is part of our strategy to focus on high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health. See Note 3, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In December 2019, the Swiss government enacted changes to its corporate tax regime, which included, among other items, the repeal of certain preferential tax regimes and an increase to the cantonal tax rate for future periods. Additionally, the government provided transition rules which allowed companies to record goodwill for tax purposes, partially offsetting the impact on cash taxes of the higher cantonal rate over the next ten years. As a result of these changes, the Company recorded an estimated net benefit of $29 to the Provision for income taxes.In 2019, the Company received a favorable judgment regarding certain value-added tax previously paid in Brazil. As a result of the favorable judgment, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company filed an application with the Brazilian government to recover value-added tax previously paid and recorded a benefit of $30 pretax ($20 aftertax). The recovery will be utilized to offset corporate income tax payments in Brazil in future periods.In January 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Physicians Care Alliance, LLC and Elta MD Holdings, Inc., professional skin health businesses, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $730. See Note 3, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA” or “U.S. tax reform”), in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional charge of $275 based on its initial analysis of the TCJA using information and estimates available as of February 15, 2018, the date on which the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company finalized its assessment of the impact of the TCJA and recognized an additional tax expense of $80 reflecting the impact of transition tax guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the update of certain estimates and calculations based on information available through the end of 2018.Our restructuring program, known as the “Global Growth and Efficiency Program,” concluded on December 31, 2019. The program’s initiatives were designed to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales, operating profit and earnings per share and to enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses. Substantially all initiatives under the program were implemented as of December 31, 2019. The initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program focused on the following areas:▪Expanding Commercial Hubs▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and FacilitiesSavings, substantially all of which have been realized, are projected to be in the range of $640 to $660 pretax ($580 to $590 aftertax) annually. Substantially all of the savings are expected to increase future cash flows. Total pretax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were $1,854 pretax ($1,380 aftertax), in line with the previously disclosed range.In 2019 and 2018, we incurred aftertax costs of $102 and $125, respectively, resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. For more information regarding the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 22(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Effective January 1, 2019, as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB""), the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" which superseded Topic 840, ""Leases,"" which was further modified in ASU No. 2018-10, ""Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,"" ASU No. 2018-11, ""Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements"" and ASU No. 2019-01 ""Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements"" to clarify the implementation guidance. The new accounting standard required the recognition on the balance sheet of right-of-use assets and leases liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases. The Company elected the optional transition method and adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019, on a modified retrospective basis, with no restatement of prior period amounts. As allowed under the new accounting standard, the Company elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations, leases classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption. The Company also elected not to separate lease components from non-lease components and to exclude short-term leases from its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company's adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of $458 and liabilities of $574, with no material cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the date of adoption. In connection with the adoption of this guidance, as required, the Company reclassified certain restructuring reserves incurred in connection with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program (see Note 4, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and deferred rent liabilities as reductions to lease assets. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income or Cash Flows. See Note 15, Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 23(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)OutlookLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging. Although we have seen improvement in category growth rates, we expect category growth rates to remain below historical levels. While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. We have also been negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers in key markets, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space or delisting of our products. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of eCommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and the emergence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. This rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. In addition, given that approximately 70% of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and higher raw and packaging material costs. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect our future results. In addition, although we are taking steps to mitigate the impact of the novel coronavirus on our business, we expect it will negatively impact our business and results of operations in the near term. Because this situation is continuing to develop, the full extent of the impact is not yet known and will depend on, among other things, the duration of quarantines and other travel restrictions, both within China and into and out of China, and the degree to which the virus spreads beyond currently affected geographies. For more information about factors that could impact our business see Part I, Item 1A ""Risk Factors.""In summary, we believe we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on our key priorities: growing sales through engaging with consumers, developing world-class innovation and working with retail partners; driving efficiency on every line of the income statement to increase margins; generating strong cash flow performance and utilizing that cash effectively to enhance total shareholder return; and leading to win by staying true to the Company’s culture and focusing on its stakeholders. Our commitment to these priorities, together with the strength of our global brands, our broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets and cost-saving initiatives, such as our funding-the-growth initiatives, should position us well to increase shareholder value over the long term. 24(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of Operations This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018.

The increase in organic sales in 2019 versus 2018 was due to organic sales growth in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.Operating profit in Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased to $703 in 2019 from $680 in 2018, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 70 bps to 27.8%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (40 bps) and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (300 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (160 bps) and higher pricing. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (140 bps), partially offset by lower overhead expenses (110 bps).During the quarter ended March 31, 2019, Hill’s announced a voluntary recall, which was subsequently expanded, of select canned dog food products due to potentially elevated levels of Vitamin D resulting from a supplier error. In the United States, the voluntary recall was conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Following the announcement of the voluntary recall, and as of December 31, 2019, Hill’s and/or the Company have been named as defendants in 37 putative class action lawsuits, one putative class action filed on behalf of a European Union class and one individual action, all related to the voluntary recall and filed in various jurisdictions in the United States. In addition, two putative class actions related to the voluntary recall have been filed in Canada. Eight of the putative class actions lawsuits in the United States have been voluntarily dismissed. Hill’s is entitled to indemnification from the supplier related to the voluntary recall. Sales of products voluntarily recalled represent less than 2% of Hill’s annual Net sales. The sales loss and other costs associated with the voluntary recall and subsequent expansion did not have a material impact on the Company’s Net sales or Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 and are not expected to have a material impact in future periods. 37(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Corporate 2019 2018 % ChangeOperating profit (loss)$(654) $(602) 9%Corporate operations include Corporate overhead costs, research and development costs, stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock unit awards, restructuring and related implementation costs and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines.

The program was expanded in 2014, expanded and extended in each of 2015 and 2017 and expanded again on October 31, 2019 to take advantage of additional savings opportunities near the end of the program. The program concluded on December 31, 2019. Substantially all initiatives under the program have been implemented as of December 31, 2019.Initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were designed to help the Company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales, operating profit and earnings per share and to enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses, producing significant benefits in the Company’s long-term business performance. The major objectives of the program included:▪Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities. ▪Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions. ▪Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company’s gross and operating profit.▪Building on Colgate’s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth. 38(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were focused on the following areas:▪Expanding Commercial Hubs – Building on the success of the hub structure implemented around the world, streamlining operations in order to drive smarter and faster decision-making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions – Optimizing the Company’s shared service organizational model in all regions of the world and continuing to streamline global functions to improve cost structure.▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities – Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.Savings, substantially all of which have been realized, are projected to be in the range of $640 to $660 pretax ($580 to $590 aftertax) annually. Substantially all of the savings are expected to increase future cash flows. The Company achieved savings in 2019 of approximately $65 pretax ($60 aftertax). Total pretax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were $1,854 pretax ($1,380 aftertax), in line with the previously disclosed range.Total pretax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (40%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (10%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of related implementation charges resulting directly from exit activities (30%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). Over the course of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, approximately 80% of the charges resulted in cash expenditures. Total pretax charges related to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe (20%), Latin America (5%), Asia Pacific (5%), Africa/Eurasia (5%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (10%) and Corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. The Global Growth and Efficiency Program contributed a net reduction of approximately 4,400 positions from the Company’s global employee workforce. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, restructuring and related implementation charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: 2019 2018Cost of sales $8 $31Selling, general and administrative expenses 60 33Other (income) expense, net 57 88Non-service related postretirement costs 7 9Total Global Growth and Efficiency Program charges, pretax $132 $161 Total Global Growth and Efficiency Program charges, aftertax $102 $125Restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives were predominantly centrally directed and controlled and were not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. 39(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Total pretax charges incurred for the Global Growth and Efficiency Program related to initiatives undertaken by the following reportable operating segments: Total Program 2019 2018 ChargesNorth America4 % 18 % 17%Latin America12 % 10 % 5%Europe 4 % (2)% 19%Asia Pacific 6 % 13 % 4%Africa/Eurasia(1)% 5 % 5%Hill’s Pet Nutrition2 % 19 % 8%Corporate73 % 37 % 42%Total100 % 100 % 100%Over the course of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the Company incurred total pretax charges of $1,854 ($1,380 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows: Total Program Charges as of December 31, 2019Employee-Related Costs$706Incremental Depreciation128Asset Impairments58Other962Total$1,854Over the course of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the majority of the costs incurred related to the following projects: the implementation of the Company’s overall hubbing strategy; the consolidation of facilities; the extension of shared business services and streamlining of global functions; the closing of the Morristown, New Jersey personal care facility; the simplification and streamlining of the Company’s research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain, both in Europe; redesigning the European commercial organization; restructuring how the Company will provide future retirement benefits to substantially all of the U.S.-based employees participating in the Company’s defined benefit retirement plan by shifting them to the Company’s defined contribution plan; and the implementation of a Corporate efficiencies program. 40(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and related implementation charges, in the respective periods, discussed above and the related accruals: Employee-RelatedCosts IncrementalDepreciation AssetImpairments Other TotalBalance at January 1, 2017 $56 $— $— $125 $181Charges 163 10 9 151 333Cash payments (74) — — (170) (244)Charges against assets (21) (10) (9) — (40)Foreign exchange 3 — — 1 4Other — — — — —Balance at December 31, 2017 $127 $— $— $107 $234Charges 53 2 16 90 161Cash payments (107) — — (60) (167)Charges against assets (9) (2) (16) — (27)Foreign exchange (4) — — — (4)Other — — — 5 5Balance at December 31, 2018 $60 $— $— $142 $202Charges 25 36 6 65 132Cash payments (55) — — (58) (113)Charges against assets (7) (36) (6) (27) (76)Foreign exchange 3 — — — 3Other — — — (48) (48)Balance at December 31, 2019 $26 $— $— $74 $100Employee-Related Costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and were calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Employee-Related Costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $7, $9, and $21 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities. See Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Incremental Depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments were recorded to write down inventories and assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments were net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.Other charges consisted primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. These charges for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 included third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $32, $42 and $145, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $5, $48 and $6, respectively. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 were other exit costs of $28 related to the consolidation of facilities. Other decreases to the restructuring accruals in 2019 reflect the reclassification of restructuring accruals to lease assets as a result of the Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,” on January 1, 2019. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15, Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 41(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is provided below.Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and, as applicable, acquisition-related costs, the benefits related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil and Swiss income tax reform, the benefit from a foreign tax matter and the charge related to U.S. tax reform (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain acquisitions, divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations. 42(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of Net sales growth to organic sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2019Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America2.0%(0.5)%—%2.5%Latin America—%(7.0)%—%7.0%Europe(2.0)%(5.5)%3.0%0.5%Asia Pacific(1.0)%(2.5)%—%1.5%Africa/Eurasia1.5%(6.0)%0.5%7.0%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care—%(4.0)%0.5%3.5%Pet Nutrition6.0%(1.5)%—%7.5%Total Company1.0%(3.5)%0.5%4.0%Year ended December 31, 2018Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America7.5%—%5.0%2.5%Latin America(7.5)%(6.5)%—%(1.0)%Europe4.5%4.0%—%0.5%Asia Pacific(1.5)%—%—%(1.5)%Africa/Eurasia(1.5)%(4.0)%—%2.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care—%(1.5)%1.5%—%Pet Nutrition4.0%0.5%—%3.5%Total Company0.5%(1.0)%1.0%0.5%Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. In particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as eCommerce or certain discounters. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. We believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors. 43(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, stock repurchases and acquisitions). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations increased to $3,133 in 2019 as compared to $3,056 in 2018, primarily due to improved working capital and lower income tax payments, which were partially offset by higher voluntary contributions to the Company’s pension plans and lower net income. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (1.6)% in 2019 and (1.7)% in 2018. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales is primarily due to lower accrued income taxes, partially offset by the impact of the Company’s adoption of the new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. See Note 15, Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. The program was expanded in 2014, expanded and extended in each of 2015 and 2017, and expanded again on October 31, 2019 to take advantage of additional savings opportunities near the end of the program. The program concluded on December 31, 2019. Substantially all initiatives under the program were implemented as of December 31, 2019.Total program charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were $1,854 pretax ($1,380 aftertax), in line with the previously disclosed range. Approximately 80% of total program charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program resulted in cash expenditures. Savings from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, substantially all of which have been realized, are projected to be in the range of $640 to $660 pretax ($580 to $590 aftertax) annually. Substantially all of the savings are expected to increase future cash flows. Total pretax charges for 2019 were $132 ($102 aftertax). Savings in 2019 were approximately $65 pretax ($60 aftertax). Approximately 85% of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2019 is expected to be paid before year-end 2020.Investing activities used $2,099 of cash in 2019 compared to $1,170 during 2018. As more fully described below, investing activities in 2019 include the Company’s acquisition of Filorga and the Nigeria Joint Venture. Investing activities in 2018 include the Company’s acquisition of the outstanding equity interests of Physicians Care Alliance, LLC and Elta MD Holdings, Inc. for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $730. Purchases of marketable securities and investments increased in 2019 to $184 from $169 in 2018. Proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2019 to $131 from $156 in 2018.Capital expenditures in 2019 were $335, a decrease from $436 in 2018. Capital expenditures decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower spending on manufacturing facilities and capital projects related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Capital expenditures for 2020 are expected to be approximately 2.5% to 3.0% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns.On September 19, 2019, the Company acquired Filorga for cash consideration of €1,516 (approximately $1,674) plus additional consideration of €32 (approximately $38), the majority of which related to repayment of loans from former shareholders of Filorga. On August 15, 2019, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in the Nigeria Joint Venture for $31. These acquisitions were financed with a combination of debt and cash. As a result of the incremental debt related to these acquisitions, the Company moderated its share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2019 and will continue to do so into 2021 in order to reduce debt levels.On January 31, 2020, the Company acquired Hello Products LLC, an oral care business, for cash consideration of $351 million. The acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash. This acquisition is part of the Company’s continued strategy to focus on the high growth segments within its Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. 44(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Financing activities used $870 of cash during 2019 compared to $2,679 during 2018. The decrease in cash used in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher net proceeds from the issuance of debt and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options.Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $7,587 as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $6,354 as of December 31, 2018 and total debt increased to $7,847 as of December 31, 2019 as compared to $6,366 as of December 31, 2018, in both cases due primarily to the acquisition of Filorga. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company issued €500 of seven-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.500% and €500 of fifteen-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 1.375%. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company issued €500 of two-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.000% and €500 of twenty-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.875%. The debt issuances were under the Company’s shelf registration statement. The debt issuances support the Company’s capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. Proceeds from the debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes, which included the retirement of commercial paper and, in the case of the debt issuances in the first quarter of 2019, the repayment of the Company’s $500 1.75% fixed rate notes, which became due in March 2019, and €500 floating rate notes, which became due May 2019.At December 31, 2019, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $4,594 (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated $2,650 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that was scheduled to expire in November 2023. In August 2019, the term of the facility was extended by one year and it now expires in November 2024. In August 2019, the Company entered into a $1,500 364-day credit facility with a syndicate of banks that is scheduled to expire in August 2020. Commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $829 and $534 as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2019 and 2018 were $1,868 and $1,773, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit of $4,150 (under the facilities discussed above).The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities OutstandingGlobal short-term borrowings 1.8 % 2020 $10 5.3% 2019 $12Commercial Paper (1) (0.4)% 2020 829 2.5% 2019 534Total $839 $546(1) Commercial paper includes a current portion of $250, included in Notes and loans payable. Certain of the agreements with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. Refer to Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2019 were $1,614, an increase from $1,591 in 2018. Dividend payments increased to $1.71 per share in 2019 from $1.66 per share in 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company increased the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.43 per share from $0.42 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2019. 45(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On June 18, 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under the 2018 Program, which replaced the 2015 Program. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs. The shares are repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the Company’s discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors.Aggregate share repurchases in 2019 consisted of approximately 16.0 million common shares under the 2018 Program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,202. Aggregate repurchases in 2018 consisted of 8.9 million common shares under the 2018 Program, 8.7 million common shares under the 2015 Program and 1.1 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,238. Cash and cash equivalents increased $157 during 2019 to $883 at December 31, 2019, compared to $726 at December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries was $798 and $651, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and 2018.The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019: Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion(1) $7,018 $267 $860 $903 $895 $498 $3,595Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2) 1,999 153 146 131 106 89 1,374Operating Leases 735 167 127 101 63 36 241Purchase obligations(3) 559 291 148 93 8 12 7U.S. tax reform payments 220 — 10 25 46 62 77Total $10,531 $878 $1,291 $1,253 $1,118 $697 $5,294_______(1) The Company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next 12 months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The amounts in this table exclude such obligations.(2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(3) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2019 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2020. The Company does not expect to make any voluntary contributions to its U.S. postretirement plans in 2020. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2020 from the Company’s assets are estimated to be approximately $55.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. 46(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $6 and a net unrealized gain of $9 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2019, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $82. 47(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2019 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $9 in 2019.The Company is assessing the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements, including debt outstanding, and believes it will not be material as the Company does not have significant exposure to LIBOR in either its debt or other financing arrangements. The Company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, essential oils, pulp, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, were not material. At the end of 2019, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn January 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-01, “Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)-Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815.” The guidance provides clarification of the interaction of rules for equity securities, the equity method of accounting and forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, “Income taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses.” This ASU clarifies and addresses certain items related to amendments in ASU 2016-13. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 48(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In July 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-07, “Codification Updates to SEC Sections - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, and Nos. 33-10231 and 33-10442, Investment Company Reporting Modernization and Miscellaneous Updates.” ASU 2019-07 clarified or improved the disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of codification topics by aligning them with the SEC’s regulations, thereby eliminating redundancies and making the codification easier to apply. This ASU was effective upon issuance and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, “Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Financial Instruments (Topic 825).” This ASU clarifies three topics related to financial instruments accounting. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-16, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) Overnight Index Swap (“OIS”) Rate as Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes.” The new guidance permits the use of the OIS rate based on the SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815. This new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2019, concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2017-12, and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Topic 350): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract.” This new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. This new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective or retrospective basis beginning on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to adopt this guidance early, beginning on January 1, 2019, on a prospective basis. The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Topic 715): Disclosure Framework–Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.” This new guidance removes certain disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures and requires certain additional disclosures. This new guidance was effective for the Company on a retrospective basis beginning on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to adopt this guidance early, beginning on January 1, 2019, on a retrospective basis. The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” This new guidance removes certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifies existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adds new disclosure requirements. The new disclosure requirements include disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020. Certain disclosure requirements in the new guidance will need to be applied on a retrospective basis and others on a prospective basis. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, “Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (“ASU 2018-02”), which permits the reclassification of stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA” or “U.S. tax reform”) from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Retained earnings. This new guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and must be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to periods in which the effects of the TCJA are recognized. The Company elected to adopt this new guidance early, beginning on January 1, 2018, and reclassified $163 during the first quarter of 2018. 49(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities,” amending the eligibility criteria for hedged items and transactions to expand an entity’s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and present hedge ineffectiveness and aligns the presentation of hedge gains and losses with the underlying hedge item. The new guidance also simplifies the hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. The amended presentation and disclosure requirements must be adopted on a prospective basis, while any amendments to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption must be applied on a “modified retrospective” basis, meaning a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The new guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting,” clarifying when a change to the terms or conditions of a stock-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. The new guidance requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award. The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or the conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation–Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost,” changing the presentation of the net periodic benefit cost on the Statement of Income and limiting the amount of net periodic benefit cost eligible for capitalization to assets. The new guidance permits only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The new guidance also requires entities to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost together with compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The non-service related components of net periodic benefit cost, which include interest, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses, are required to be presented outside of Operating profit. The line item or items used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if not separately described on the Statement of Income. The new presentation requirement was adopted on a “full retrospective” basis, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented in the financial statements, while the limitation on capitalization was adopted on a prospective basis. Effective January 1, 2018, as required, the Company adopted this standard on a retrospective basis. As permitted by the new guidance, the Company used the amounts disclosed in its pension and other postretirement benefit plan note for the prior comparative periods as the basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements. As a result, for all periods presented, only the service related component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs is included in Operating profit. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” eliminating the requirement to calculate implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standard is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2020. This new guidance is expected to have no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business,” which provides additional guidance on evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The guidance requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, then the new guidance would define the transaction as an asset acquisition. If the threshold is not met, then the entity would, pursuant to the guidance, evaluate whether the assets meet the requirement that a business include, at a minimum, an input and substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The guidance was effective for the Company, on a prospective basis, beginning on January 1, 2018. This new guidance had no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 50(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,” which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments are to be presented in the statement of cash flows. The guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. This new guidance had no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326).” This ASU introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which will require an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity will be required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued its final standard on lease accounting, ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which superseded Topic 840, “Leases.” which was further modified in ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,” ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements” and ASU No. 2019-01 “Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements” to clarify the implementation guidance. The new accounting standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and required the recognition on the balance sheet of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. The Company elected the optional transition method and adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019, on a modified retrospective basis, with no restatement of prior period amounts. As allowed under the new accounting standard, the Company elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations, lease classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption. The Company also elected not to separate lease components from non-lease components and to exclude short-term leases from its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of $458 and liabilities of $574, with no material cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the date of adoption. In connection with the adoption of this guidance, as required, the Company reclassified certain restructuring reserves incurred in connection with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and deferred rent liabilities as reductions to lease assets. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income or Cash Flows. See Note 15 Leases for additional information.In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. The standard, issued as ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” by the FASB, provides a comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to its customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also includes enhanced disclosures. During 2016, the FASB issued several accounting updates (ASU No. 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12) to clarify implementation guidance and correct unintended application of the guidance. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018, on a “modified retrospective” basis, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. As required, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings. Results for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the prior accounting guidance under Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition.” 51(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (80% of inventories) and the LIFO method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2019 or 2018 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 810 bps in both 2019 and 2018 and 760 bps in 2017, with no impact on reported earnings.The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves.▪In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 3.40% and 4.38% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 3.56%, and 4.43% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 6.30% as of December 31, 2019 and 6.60% as of 2018. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return. 52(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 17%, 6%, 8%, 7% and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 68% in fixed income securities, 24% in equity securities and 8% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $14. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $3. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2019, and 2018. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 6.00% for 2020, declining to 4.75% by 2025 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $7.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $10.48. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 5%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%. The Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. The Monte-Carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the Black Scholes model.▪Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis. Determining the fair value of the Company’s reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate. Estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. In selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the Company considers recent market transactions for similar brands and products. In determining an appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. Other qualitative factors the Company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. 53(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In determining the fair value of the Company’s reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. As multiple valuation methodologies are used, the Company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share, brand history, future expansion expectations, the level of in-market support anticipated by management, legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold. The estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition in 2011 and the Filorga acquisition in 2019, which were recorded at fair value. Except for recently acquired businesses where there is inherently a lower surplus of fair value over carrying value, the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets.The Company determined that the fair value of the Sanex intangible assets exceeded their carrying value by more than 10% and concluded that such excess was reasonable considering the brand’s relatively recent acquisition. Based on this, the brand’s recent performance and the Company’s future plans for the brand, the Company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to the Sanex intangible assets. Given the recent acquisition of Filorga, its performance since its acquisition and the Company’s future plans for Filorga, the Company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to the Filorga intangible assets.▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies. 54(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings per share growth, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, cost-reduction plans, tax rates, new product introductions, commercial investment levels, acquisitions and divestitures, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive OverviewBusiness OrganizationColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us” “our” the “Company” or “Colgate”) is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling products globally that make people’s lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion strategies across our organization.We are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.Operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approximately 70% of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors. Through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the Company’s use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Market Share Information” below.25(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop and have significantly impacted and will likely continue to impact economic activity around the world. We have a well-established Crisis Management Team (“CMT”) process, and the CMT, together with our senior management team and Colgate people around the world, continue to respond to and manage the challenges presented by COVID-19.During the year ended December 31, 2020, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced unprecedented “stay at home” orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19, and have implemented varying policies to resume economic activity. The situation continues to be uncertain and varies by geography, as infection rates of COVID-19 continue to increase in many regions throughout the world, and authorities have taken different approaches to address the pandemic and resume economic activity. Because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business. In doing so, the health, safety and well-being of our employees has been and remains our first priority. Many of our employees globally continue to work from home. In those instances where our employees cannot perform their work at home, such as in our factories and in certain of our laboratories, or in geographies where circumstances have allowed us to offer employees the ability to return to the office, often on a voluntary and staggered basis, we have implemented additional health and safety measures and social distancing protocols, consistent with government recommendations and/or requirements, to help to ensure their safety, often at an additional cost. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced some limited factory closures and, in some cases, we have seen increased instances of absenteeism. Furthermore, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses.We saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories in the year ended December 31, 2020, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, driven by consumer pantry-loading and increased consumption of our products. We believe that some of the increase in consumption in these categories is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to COVID-19. In other categories, such as oral care and pet food, consumer demand trends continued to normalize in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2020. Across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and retailer availability. At the same time, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced declines in certain channels, including professional sales and travel retail, due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movement in many geographies throughout the world. We also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. In some instances during the year ended December 31, 2020, we were not able to keep up with the increased consumer demand for our products, and our products were at times out of stock on retailers’ shelves. In some cases, we have incurred additional costs as we worked to meet this increased demand. Despite continuing to significantly ramp up production of in-demand products, we expect that some of our products may continue to be out of stock on retailers’ shelves for a period of time.COVID-19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers’ ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. While we believe that, in the long-term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the timing and extent of the pandemic and the recovery from it. These uncertainties include: the impact of the timing and scale of changes to travel and movement restrictions in certain geographies, the availability and widespread distribution and use of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and when communities will reach herd immunity, the timing and impact of consumer pantry-loading and destocking activity in certain markets, product demand trends and the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties are also being impacted by the global pandemic; their success in addressing COVID-19 and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to and sales of our products. We expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with COVID-19 to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences despite the lifting of government restrictions and the reopening of economies around the world.26(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)While we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees and contract providers, uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs.For more information about the anticipated COVID-19 impact, see “Outlook” below.Business StrategyTo achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on innovating our core businesses; improving our brand building activities with an elevated brand purpose model and the use of equity advertising; innovating to gain market share in high growth segments and adjacencies; expanding into new channels and markets; maximizing growth online; and investing to drive consumption in growing populations. We continue to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. In addition, we continue to invest behind our brands, not just in terms of advertising, but also to build key growth capabilities in areas such as innovation and data and analytics. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products. We are also working to integrate our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion strategies across our organization.We are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.The investments needed to drive growth are supported by strong cash flow performance and our disciplined capital allocation strategy. These investments are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health. Significant Items Impacting ComparabilityOn January 31, 2020, we acquired Hello Products LLC (“hello”), an oral care business, for cash consideration of $351. The acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash. This acquisition is part of our strategy to focus on high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. See Note 3, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. As described more fully in “Results of Operations-Income Taxes,” below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”).27(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Our restructuring program, known as the “Global Growth and Efficiency Program,” concluded on December 31, 2019. Initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program fit within the program’s three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we adjusted the accrual balances related to certain projects approved prior to the conclusion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program to reflect our revised estimate of remaining liabilities, which resulted in a reduction of $16 ($13 aftertax) to restructuring accruals. No new restructuring projects were approved for implementation during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred costs of $132 ($102 aftertax) resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. For more information regarding the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In December 2019, the Swiss government enacted changes to its corporate tax regime, which included, among other items, the repeal of certain preferential tax regimes and an increase to the cantonal tax rate for future periods. Additionally, the government provided transition rules which allowed companies to record goodwill for tax purposes, partially offsetting the impact on cash taxes of the higher cantonal rate over the next ten years. As a result of these changes, we recorded a net benefit of $29 to the Provision for income taxes.In September 2019, we acquired Laboratoires Filorga Cosmétiques S.A. (“Filorga”), a skin health business, for cash consideration of €1,548 (approximately $1,712). In the third quarter of 2020, we completed the purchase of the outstanding non-controlling interest of Filorga’s joint venture based in Hong Kong and covering the Hong Kong and China markets for approximately €85 (approximately $99) in cash. See Note 3, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2019, we received a favorable judgment regarding certain value-added tax previously paid in Brazil. As a result of the favorable judgment, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we filed an application with the Brazilian government to recover value-added tax previously paid and recorded a benefit of $30 pretax ($20 aftertax). The recovery will be utilized to offset corporate income tax payments in Brazil in future periods. 28(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)OutlookLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, especially due to COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen improvement in category growth rates due to heightened demand for certain health and hygiene products, particularly liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners. We believe some of this increased consumption is sustainable due to consumer behavior changes resulting from COVID-19. However, we expect increased volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates over the next six to twelve months. In the longer term, we expect category growth rates to remain below historical levels. While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. We have seen increases in promotional activities in certain markets as retailers try aggressively to get consumers back into the stores after prolonged “stay at home” and other government restrictions ease, a trend we expect will continue. We have been negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers in key markets, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products or sustainability, supply chain or packaging initiatives. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. These trends have been magnified due to COVID-19 in many of our geographies and we plan to continue to invest behind our eCommerce capabilities. This rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. In certain markets, we have incurred and are likely to continue to incur increased logistics costs due to higher eCommerce demand and volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry. In addition, given that approximately 70% of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience increasingly volatile foreign currency fluctuations and higher raw and packaging material costs. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. Should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results. As discussed above, we continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of COVID-19’s impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. For more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to COVID-19, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.In summary, we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, broad based experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain and focused business strategy. Our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth through innovation within our core businesses, leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories and expanding in high growth channels and markets; delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency; and maximizing the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs; and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. Our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through COVID-19 and increase shareholder value over time.29(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of OperationsThis section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019.

Acquisitions contributed 2.0% to volume. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment increased 6.0% in 2020.The increase in organic sales in 2020 versus 2019 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste category. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the liquid hand soap and bar soap categories. The increase in Home Care was due to organic sales growth in the hand dish and liquid cleaner categories.The Company’s share of the global toothpaste market was 39.8% for full year 2020, down 0.7 share points from full year 2019, and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 31.1% for full year 2020, up 0.2 share points from full year 2019.

Organic sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 14.5% in 2020.The increase in organic sales in 2020 versus 2019 was primarily due to increases in organic sales in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.30(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Gross Profit/MarginWorldwide Gross profit increased 7% to $10,017 in 2020 from $9,325 in 2019. Gross profit in both periods included acquisition-related costs. Gross profit in 2019 included charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Excluding these items in both periods, as applicable, Gross profit increased to $10,021 in 2020 from $9,336 in 2019, reflecting an increase of $472 resulting from higher Net sales and an increase of $213 resulting from higher Gross profit margin.Worldwide Gross profit margin increased to 60.8% in 2020 from 59.4% in 2019. Excluding the items described above in both periods, as applicable, Gross profit margin increased by 130 basis points (bps) to 60.8% in 2020, from 59.5% in 2019. This increase in Gross profit margin was primarily due to cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (230 bps) and higher pricing (130 bps), partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (230 bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs.20202019Gross profit, GAAP$10,017 $9,325 Global Growth and Efficiency Program— 8 Acquisition-related costs 4 3 Gross profit, non-GAAP$10,021 $9,336 20202019Basis Point ChangeGross profit margin, GAAP60.8 %59.4 %140 Global Growth and Efficiency Program— 0.1 Acquisition-related costs— — Gross profit margin, non-GAAP60.8 %59.5 %130 31(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% to $6,019 in 2020 from $5,575 in 2019.

As described more fully below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded by the Company in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the TCJA.As part of the previously recorded charge for the TCJA, the Company had provided for foreign withholding taxes expected to be paid on the remittance of earnings from certain overseas subsidiaries no longer deemed indefinitely reinvested. As a result of a reorganization of the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries, the Company determined that no withholding taxes will be due on the remittance by certain subsidiaries of earnings previously deemed reinvested and, accordingly, reversed $45 of previously recorded foreign withholding taxes in the first quarter of 2020.Also as part of the previously recorded charge for the TCJA, the Company provided a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to foreign tax credit carry-forwards that the Company did not expect to be able to use due to changes made by the TCJA. As a result of a new operating structure implemented within one of the Company’s divisions, the Company believes the use of these foreign tax credit carry-forwards will not be limited in the future and, accordingly, reversed the previously recorded valuation allowance of $26 in the first quarter of 2020.The effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the Company’s global business initiatives.36(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per shareNet income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company was $2,695, or $3.14 per share on a diluted basis, in 2020 compared to $2,367, or $2.75 per share on a diluted basis, in 2019. In 2020, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company included aftertax benefits resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, aftertax acquisition-related costs, a tax benefit related to subsidiary and operating structure initiatives and an aftertax loss on the early extinguishment of debt. In 2019, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company included aftertax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, aftertax acquisition-related costs, an aftertax benefit related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil and a tax benefit related to Swiss income tax reform. Excluding the items described above in both periods, as applicable, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company increased 8% to $2,633 in 2020 from $2,440 in 2019, and Earnings per common share on a diluted basis increased 8% to $3.06 in 2020 from $2.83 in 2019.2020Income Before Income TaxesProvision For Income Taxes(1)Net Income Including Noncontrolling InterestsLess: Income Attributable To Noncontrolling InterestsNet Income Attributable to Colgate-Palmolive CompanyDiluted Earnings Per Share(2)As Reported GAAP$3,647 $787 $2,860 $165 $2,695 $3.14 Global Growth and Efficiency Program(16)(3)(13)— (13)(0.02)Subsidiary and operating structure initiatives— 71 (71)— (71)(0.08)Acquisition-related costs6 2 4 — 4 — Loss on early extinguishment of debt23 5 18 — 18 0.02 Non-GAAP$3,660 $862 $2,798 $165 $2,633 $3.06 2019Income Before Income TaxesProvision For Income Taxes(1)Net Income Including Noncontrolling InterestsLess: Income Attributable To Noncontrolling InterestsNet Income Attributable to Colgate-Palmolive CompanyDiluted Earnings Per Share(2)As Reported GAAP$3,301 $774 $2,527 $160 $2,367 $2.75 Global Growth and Efficiency Program132 30 102 — 102 0.12 Acquisition-related costs24 4 20 — 20 0.02 Value-added tax matter in Brazil(30)(10)(20)— (20)(0.02)Swiss income tax reform— 29 (29)— (29)(0.04)Non-GAAP$3,427 $827 $2,600 $160 $2,440 $2.83 _______(1) The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.(2) The impact of non-GAAP adjustments on diluted earnings per share may not necessarily equal the difference between “GAAP” and “non-GAAP” as a result of rounding.37(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Segment ResultsThe Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.Oral, Personal and Home Care North America 20202019% ChangeNet sales$3,741 $3,424 9.5 %Operating profit$988 $982 1 %% of Net sales26.4 %28.7 %(230)bpsNet sales in North America increased 9.5% in 2020 to $3,741, driven by volume growth of 8.0% and net selling price increases of 1.5%, while foreign exchange was flat. The Company’s acquisition of hello contributed 1.5% to volume in North America. Organic sales in North America increased 8.0% in 2020. Organic sales growth was led by the United States.The increase in organic sales in North America in 2020 versus 2019 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste category. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the liquid hand soap category partially offset by a decline in organic sales in the underarm protection category. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the hand dish and liquid cleaner categories. Operating profit in North America increased 1% in 2020 to $988, but decreased as a percentage of Net sales by 230 bps to 26.4%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (270 bps), partially offset by an increase in Gross profit (80 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (190 bps), partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (100 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (180 bps) and higher overhead expenses (90 bps), primarily driven by higher logistics costs. 38(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Latin America 20202019% ChangeNet sales$3,418 $3,606 (5.0)%Operating profit$975 $963 1 %% of Net sales28.5 %26.7 %180 bpsNet sales in Latin America decreased 5.0% in 2020 to $3,418, as volume growth of 0.5% and net selling price increases of 8.5% were more than offset by negative foreign exchange of 14.0%.

This increase in Gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (140 bps) and higher pricing, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (170 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (270 bps), partially offset by lower overhead expenses (180 bps). This increase in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the voluntary recall for which Hill's was not indemnified.During the quarter ended March 31, 2019, Hill’s announced a voluntary recall, which was subsequently expanded, of select canned dog food products due to potentially elevated levels of Vitamin D resulting from a supplier error. In the United States, the voluntary recall was conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Following the announcement of the voluntary recall, and as of December 31, 2020, Hill’s and/or the Company have been named as defendants in 37 putative class action lawsuits, one putative class action filed on behalf of a European Union class and one individual action, all related to the voluntary recall and filed in various jurisdictions in the United States. In addition, two putative class actions related to the voluntary recall have been filed in Canada. Eight of the putative class actions lawsuits in the United States and one of the putative class action lawsuits in Canada have been voluntarily dismissed. During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the parties to the putative class action lawsuits in the United States (other than the class action filed on behalf of a European Union class) entered into a settlement agreement, which was preliminarily approved by the court in February 2021. The amount of the settlement is not material to the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Hill’s is indemnified by the supplier related to the voluntary recall. Sales of products voluntarily recalled represent less than 2% of Hill’s annual Net sales. The sales loss and other costs associated with the voluntary recall and its subsequent expansion did not have a material impact on the Company’s Net sales or Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are not expected to have a material impact in future periods.43(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Corporate 20202019% ChangeOperating profit (loss)$(502)$(654)(23)%Corporate operations include Corporate overhead costs, research and development costs, stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock unit awards, restructuring and related implementation costs and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines.

Initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program fit within the program’s three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. Substantially all initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program had been implemented as of December 31, 2019. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company adjusted the accrual balances related to certain projects approved prior to the conclusion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program to reflect its revised estimate of remaining liabilities. This adjustment resulted in a reduction of $16 ($13 aftertax), of which $3 was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses and $13 was recorded in Other (income) expense, net. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also made cash payments of $53 related to projects approved prior to the conclusion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, and the remaining accrual balance at December 31, 2020 was $31. No new restructuring projects were approved for implementation during the year ended December 31, 2020.For the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring and related implementation charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:2019Cost of sales$8 Selling, general and administrative expenses60 Other (income) expense, net57 Non-service related postretirement costs7 Total Global Growth and Efficiency Program charges, pretax$132 Total Global Growth and Efficiency Program charges, aftertax$102 Restructuring and related implementation charges and the adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2020 were recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives were predominantly centrally directed and controlled and were not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is provided below.Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Interest (income) expense, net, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding, as applicable, the benefits and charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the charge related to U.S. tax reform, acquisition-related costs, the benefits related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil and Swiss income tax reform, a benefit related to a reorganization of the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries and a new operating structure implemented within one of the Company’s divisions and the loss on early extinguishment of debt prior to maturity. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain acquisitions, divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.46(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of Net sales growth to organic sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2020Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America9.5%—%1.5%8.0%Latin America(5.0)%(14.0)%—%9.0%Europe12.0%1.5%7.5%3.0%Asia Pacific(0.5)%(1.0)%—%0.5%Africa/Eurasia—%(8.5)%1.0%7.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care3.0%(5.0)%2.0%6.0%Pet Nutrition14.0%(0.5)%—%14.5%Total Company5.0%(3.5)%1.5%7.0%Year ended December 31, 2019Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America2.0%(0.5)%—%2.5%Latin America—%(7.0)%—%7.0%Europe(2.0)%(5.5)%3.0%0.5%Asia Pacific(1.0)%(2.5)%—%1.5%Africa/Eurasia1.5%(6.0)%0.5%7.0%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care—%(4.0)%0.5%3.5%Pet Nutrition6.0%(1.5)%—%7.5%Total Company1.0%(3.5)%0.5%4.0%Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. In particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as eCommerce or certain discounters. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In certain limited circumstances, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the ability of our third-party vendors to provide the Company with reliable updated market share data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.47(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations increased to $3,719 in 2020 as compared to $3,133 in 2019, primarily due to changes in working capital, higher net income and lower voluntary contributions to the Company’s pension plans, which were partially offset by higher income tax payments. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (4.4)% in 2020 and (1.6)% in 2019. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales is primarily due to higher accrued liabilities, higher accounts payable and higher accrued income taxes, partially offset by an increase in inventory. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Investing activities used $779 of cash in 2020 compared to $2,099 during 2019. As more fully described below, investing activities in 2020 include the Company’s acquisition of hello. Investing activities in 2019 include the Company’s acquisition of Filorga and the Nigeria Joint Venture. Purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2020 to $143 from $184 in 2019. Proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2020 to $124 from $131 in 2019.Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $410, an increase from $335 in 2019. Capital expenditures increased in 2020 primarily due to capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and sustainability projects. Capital expenditures for 2021 are expected to be approximately 3.0% to 3.5% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns.On January 31, 2020, the Company acquired hello for cash consideration of $351 as part of the Company’s continued strategy to focus on the high growth segments within its Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. On September 19, 2019, the Company acquired Filorga for cash consideration of €1,516 (approximately $1,674) plus additional consideration of €32 (approximately $38), the majority of which related to repayment of loans from former shareholders of Filorga. In July 2020, the Company completed the purchase of the outstanding non-controlling interest of Filorga’s joint venture based in Hong Kong and covering the Hong Kong and China markets for approximately €85 (approximately $99) in cash. On August 15, 2019, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in the Nigeria Joint Venture for $31. These acquisitions were financed with a combination of debt and cash. As a result of the incremental debt related to these acquisitions, in accordance with the Company’s previously announced intention to moderate share repurchases, net of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, the Company continued to moderate its share repurchases, net in 2020. In addition, due to the initial uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and our intent to preserve cash, the Company discontinued all share repurchases other than those pursuant to equity plans during the second quarter of 2020. The Company resumed its moderated share repurchases, net in the third quarter of 2020. We expect share repurchases, net to return to historical levels in 2021.Financing activities used $2,919 of cash during 2020 compared to $870 during 2019. The increase in cash used was primarily due to net payments on debt in 2020 as compared to net proceeds from the issuance of debt in 2019.Long-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $7,343 as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $7,587 as of December 31, 2019, and total debt decreased to $7,601 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to $7,847 as of December 31, 2019. The Company’s debt issuances and redemptions support the Company’s capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.48(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company redeemed prior to maturity all of its outstanding 2.450% notes due 2021 with a principal amount of $300, originally issued on November 8, 2011, and all of its outstanding 2.300% notes due 2022 with a principal amount of $500, originally issued on May 3, 2012. These redemptions were financed with commercial paper borrowings and cash. The Company recorded a loss on this early extinguishment of debt of $23, which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.During the first quarter of 2019, the Company issued €500 of seven-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.500% and €500 of fifteen-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 1.375%. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company issued €500 of two-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.000% and €500 of twenty-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.875%. The debt issuances were under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes, which included the retirement of commercial paper and, in the case of the debt issuances in the first quarter of 2019, the repayment of the Company’s $500 1.750% fixed rate notes, which became due in March 2019, and €500 floating rate notes, which became due in May 2019.At December 31, 2020, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $4,657 (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated $2,650 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that was scheduled to expire in November 2023. In August 2019, the term of the facility was extended by one year and it now expires in November 2024. In August 2020, the Company entered into a $1,500 364-day credit facility with a syndicate of banks that is scheduled to expire in August 2021. Commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $1,389 and $829 as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2020 and 2019 were $1,050 and $1,868, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its available lines of credit (under the facilities discussed above).The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: 20202019 Weighted Average Interest RateMaturitiesOutstandingWeighted Average Interest RateMaturitiesOutstandingGlobal short-term borrowings4.8 %2021$8 1.8 %2020$10 Commercial Paper (1)(0.3)%20211,389 (0.4)%2020829 Total$1,397 $839 (1) Commercial paper includes a current portion of $250, included in Notes and loans payable, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Certain of the agreements with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. Refer to Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2020 were $1,654, an increase from $1,614 in 2019. Dividend payments increased to $1.75 per share in 2020 from $1.71 per share in 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company increased the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.44 per share from $0.43 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2020. 49(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On June 18, 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under the 2018 Program. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs. The shares are repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the Company’s discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors.Aggregate share repurchases in 2020 consisted of approximately 18.2 million common shares under the 2018 Program and 0.4 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,476. Aggregate repurchases in 2019 consisted of 16.0 million common shares under the 2018 Program, and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,202. Share repurchases net of proceeds from exercise of stock options were $602 and $704 in 2020 and 2019, respectively.Cash and cash equivalents increased $5 during 2020 to $888 at December 31, 2020, compared to $883 at December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries was $832 and $798, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and 2019.The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020: Total20212022202320242025ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion(1)$6,204 $631 $413 $896 $498 $130 $3,636 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2)1,515 109 111 96 79 72 1,048 Operating Leases715 157 133 89 58 46 232 Purchase obligations(3)715 396 188 118 8 3 2 U.S. tax reform payments 220 10 25 46 62 77 — Total$9,369 $1,303 $870 $1,245 $705 $328 $4,918 _______(1)The Company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next 12 months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The amounts in this table exclude such obligations.(2)Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(3)The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2020 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2021. The Company does not expect to make any voluntary contributions to its U.S. postretirement plans in 2021. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2021 from the Company’s assets are estimated to be approximately $90.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.50(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See “Results of Operations” above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $11 and $6 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2020, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $96.51(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2020 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $15 in 2020. The Company is assessing the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements, including debt outstanding, and believes it will not be material as the Company does not have significant exposure to LIBOR in either its debt or other financing arrangements. The Company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as essential oils, resins, pulp, tropical oils, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $3 and $0 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At the end of 2020, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized gain of $1.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-1, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.” This ASU clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. This guidance was effective upon issuance for the Company and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-10, “Codification Improvements.” This ASU improves the consistency of the codification topics by including all disclosure guidance in the appropriate disclosure section and also clarifies the application of various provisions in the codification. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. This guidance was effective upon issuance of this ASU for contract modifications and hedging relationships on a prospective basis and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.52(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-03, “Codification to Financial Instruments.” This ASU improves and clarifies various financial instruments topics, including the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) standard issued in 2016. The ASU addresses seven different issues that describe the areas of improvement and the related amendments to GAAP, intended to make the standards easier to understand and apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. The amendments related to Issue 1, Issue 2, Issue 4 and Issue 5 were effective upon issuance of this update. The amendments related to Issue 3, Issue 6 and Issue 7 were effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020. The guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, “Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)-Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815.” The guidance provides clarification of the interaction of rules for equity securities, the equity method of accounting and forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, “Income taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application.

This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, “Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Financial Instruments (Topic 825).” This ASU clarifies three topics related to financial instruments accounting. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” This guidance removes certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifies existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adds new disclosure requirements. The new disclosure requirements include disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” eliminating the requirement to calculate implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standard was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2020 and did not have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326).” This ASU introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which will require an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity will be required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.53(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method (25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2020 or 2019 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company’s Gross profit margin would have been lower by 845 bps in 2020 and by 810 bps in both 2019 and 2018, with no impact on reported earnings. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves.▪In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 2.65% and 3.40% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 2.88%, and 3.56% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 5.70% as of December 31, 2020 and 6.30% as of 2019. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return.54(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 15%, 9%, 8%, 7% and 7%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 74% in fixed income securities, 21% in equity securities and 5% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $19. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $3. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2020, and 2019. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 6.00% for 2021, declining to 4.75% by 2026 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $10.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $11.26. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 4%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%. The Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. The Monte-Carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the Black-Scholes model.▪Goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.Determining the fair value of the Company’s reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate. Estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. In selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the Company considers recent market transactions for similar brands and products. In determining an appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. Other qualitative factors the Company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.55(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In determining the fair value of the Company’s reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. As multiple valuation methodologies are used, the Company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share, brand history, future expansion expectations, the level of in-market support anticipated by management, legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the first quarter of 2020, the Company assessed whether a “triggering event” had occurred indicating a possible impairment of its goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets. As a result of this assessment, the Company determined that a “triggering event” had occurred relative to its recently acquired Filorga skin health business and, as required, performed a quantitative analysis, with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm, of the value of the Filorga reporting unit and its indefinite-life intangible assets. Based on the analysis, the Company determined that the fair value of the Filorga reporting unit and the related indefinite-life intangible assets continued to exceed their carrying values and were not impaired.As of the date of the annual goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the Filorga reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. Either a reduction in the long-term growth rate of 50 basis points or an increase in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in the fair value of the Filorga reporting unit exceeding its carrying value by less than 5%. As of the date of the annual impairment test, the fair value of the Filorga indefinite-life intangible assets exceeded their carrying value by less than 10%. Either a reduction in the long-term growth rate of 50 basis points or an increase in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in the fair value of the Filorga indefinite-life intangible assets approximating their carrying value. Given the inherent uncertainties in estimating the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on global macroeconomic conditions and interest rates in general and on the Filorga business in particular, actual results may differ from management’s current estimates and could have an adverse impact on one or more of the assumptions used in our quantitative models related to the Filorga reporting unit and the related indefinite-life intangible assets, resulting in potential impairment charges in subsequent periods. Given the recent acquisition of Filorga, where there is inherently a lower surplus of fair value over carrying value, management will continue to assess triggering events that may necessitate additional qualitative or quantitative analyses of our reporting units and indefinite-life intangible assets in future periods.Except for the recently acquired Filorga business, as described above, where there is inherently a lower surplus of fair value over carrying value, the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. The fair value of the Company’s indefinite-life intangible assets other than Filorga exceeds their recorded carrying value by at least 20%. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets.▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.56(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.57(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings per share levels, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, the impact of COVID-19, cost-reduction plans, tax rates, new product introductions, commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive OverviewBusiness OrganizationColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us” “our” the “Company” or “Colgate”) is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling products globally that make people’s and their pets’ lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and DE&I strategies across our organization.We are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.Operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approximately 70% of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors. Through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. We also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the Company’s use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Market Share Information” below.24(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop and have significantly impacted and continue to impact economic activity around the world. We have a well-established Crisis Management Team (“CMT”) process, and the CMT, together with our senior management team and Colgate people around the world, continue to respond to and manage the challenges presented by COVID-19.During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and in some cases continue to experience “stay at home” orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19, and have implemented varying policies to address the pandemic, resume economic activity and vaccinate their populations. The situation continues to be uncertain and varies by geography, as the impact of COVID-19 remains significant in many countries throughout the world, including Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities. Because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business, although not always at full capacity.The health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority. While we have reopened most of our offices, in some instances on a limited and voluntary basis, many of our office-based employees globally continue to work from home. We have implemented additional health and safety measures consistent with government recommendations and/or requirements to help ensure employee safety in our offices, production facilities, warehouses and technology centers, often at additional cost. These measures may include: health and temperature screening, social distancing and personal protective equipment protocols, hand washing, contact tracing, enhanced cleaning procedures, respiratory hygiene, education and, in some instances, testing and/or vaccination requirements. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen increased instances of absenteeism and, in some cases, we have experienced some limited production facility closures and related supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses.We saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by consumer pantry-loading and increased consumption of our products. While consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most still remained above historical levels, and we believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to COVID-19. Across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category, channel and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions. At the same time, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions in certain channels, including travel retail. We also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online.COVID-19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers’ ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. While we believe that, in the long-term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. These uncertainties include: the impact of the timing and scale of changes to travel and movement restrictions in certain geographies, the availability and widespread distribution and use of COVID-19 vaccines, the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, the timing and impact of consumer pantry-loading and destocking activity in certain markets, product demand trends and the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, including as a result of inflation, and supply chain disruptions. COVID-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. We expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with COVID-19 to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022.While we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees and third parties, uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs.For more information about the anticipated COVID-19 impact, see “Outlook” below.25(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Business StrategyTo achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through innovation on our core businesses; leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories; expanding in high-growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our ESG programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&I strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. We are strengthening our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, eCommerce and data and analytics enabling us to be more responsive in today’s rapidly changing world. In particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.We are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.The investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health. On January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the “2022 Global Productivity Initiative”). The program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2022, is projected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $200 and $240, which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below. Significant Items Impacting ComparabilityIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible related to the Filorga skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In 1990, our Canadian subsidiary (“CP Canada”), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the “Canada notes”). In the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.26(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In 2019, we received a favorable judgment regarding certain value-added tax previously paid in Brazil. As a result of this favorable judgment, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we filed an application with the Brazilian government to recover value-added tax previously paid and recorded a benefit. In May 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a clarifying ruling allowing a higher deduction of state value-added tax when determining the taxable base. In light of this ruling, we recorded an additional benefit of $26 pretax ($20 aftertax) in the year ended December 31, 2021.The Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a multi-year restructuring program, concluded on December 31, 2019. Initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program fit within the program’s three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we adjusted the accrual balances related to certain projects approved prior to the conclusion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program to reflect our revised estimate of remaining liabilities, which resulted in a reduction of $16 ($13 aftertax) to restructuring accruals. For more information regarding the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, see Note 4, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. As described more fully in “Results of Operations-Income Taxes,” below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”).On January 31, 2020, we acquired Hello Products LLC (“hello”), an oral care business, for cash consideration of $351. The acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash. This acquisition is part of our strategy to focus on high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. See Note 3, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.OutlookLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, especially due to COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, all of our divisions experienced significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. We also incurred increased logistics costs due to volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry and higher eCommerce demand. We expect this difficult cost environment to continue in 2022.While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. We have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory de-stocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and certain environmental, sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. These trends have been magnified due to COVID-19 in many of our geographies and we plan to continue to invest behind our digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses, such as eCommerce. This rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.In addition, given that approximately 70% of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations. As discussed above, we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material and logistics costs. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and our funding the growth and revenue growth management initiatives, including additional pricing, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. Should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results. 27(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)As discussed above, we continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. During 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners. While consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most remained above historical levels. We believe that some of this increased consumption is sustainable due to consumer behavior changes related to COVID-19. We expect increased volatility across all of our categories, and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term. COVID-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of COVID-19’s impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. For more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to COVID-19, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.In summary, we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, broad based experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain and focused business strategy. Our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through innovation within our core businesses, leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories, expanding in high-growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&I strategies. Our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges presented by COVID-19 and increase shareholder value over time.28(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of OperationsThis section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.Net SalesWorldwide Net sales were $17,421 in 2021, up 6.0% from 2020, due to volume growth of 1.0%, net selling price increases of 3.5%, and positive foreign exchange of 1.5%. Organic sales (Net sales excluding, as applicable, the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure as discussed below, increased 4.5% in 2021.Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment were $14,110 in 2021, up 4.0% from 2020, due to net selling price increases of 2.5% and positive foreign exchange of 1.5%, while volume was flat. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment increased 2.5% in 2021.The increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales, partially offset by a decrease in Personal Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The decrease in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales declines in the liquid hand soap and bar soap categories. The Company’s share of the global toothpaste market was 39.4% for full year 2021, down 0.3 share points from full year 2020, and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 30.9% for full year 2021, up 0.1 share points from full year 2020. Full year 2021 market shares in toothpaste were up in Europe and Africa/Eurasia and down in North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific versus full year 2020. In the manual toothbrush category, full year 2021 market shares were up in Latin America, Europe and Africa/Eurasia and down in North America and Asia Pacific versus full year 2020. For additional information regarding the Company’s use of market share data and limitations of such data, see “Market Share Information” below.Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition were $3,311 in 2021, an increase of 15.0% from 2020, driven by volume growth of 8.0%, net selling price increases of 5.5% and positive foreign exchange of 1.5%. Organic sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 13.5% in 2021.The increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to increases in organic sales in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.29(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Gross Profit/MarginWorldwide Gross profit increased 4% to $10,375 in 2021 from $10,017 in 2020. Gross profit in 2020 included acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related costs in 2020, Gross profit increased to $10,375 in 2021 from $10,021 in 2020, reflecting an increase of $565 resulting from higher Net sales and a decrease of $211 resulting from lower Gross profit margin.Worldwide Gross profit margin decreased to 59.6% in 2021 from 60.8% in 2020. This decrease in Gross profit margin was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (450 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (210 bps) and higher pricing (120 bps).20212020Gross profit, GAAP$10,375 $10,017 Acquisition-related costs — 4 Gross profit, non-GAAP$10,375 $10,021 20212020Basis Point ChangeGross profit margin59.6 %60.8 %(120)30(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% to $6,407 in 2021 from $6,019 in 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020 included benefits resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Excluding benefits resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $6,407 in 2021 from $6,022 in 2020, reflecting higher overhead expenses of $312 and increased advertising investment of $73.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased to 36.8% in 2021 from 36.5% in 2020. Excluding benefits resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased by 20 bps to 36.8% in 2021 as compared to 36.6% in 2020. This increase was due to higher overhead expenses (50 bps), driven by higher logistics costs, partially offset by decreased advertising investment (30 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. In 2021, advertising investment decreased as a percentage of Net sales to 11.6% from 11.9% in 2020, while it increased in absolute terms by 3.7% to $2,021 as compared with $1,948 in 2020.20212020Selling, general and administrative expenses, GAAP$6,407 $6,019 Global Growth and Efficiency Program— 3 Selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP$6,407 $6,022 20212020Basis Point ChangeSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, GAAP36.8 %36.5 %30 Global Growth and Efficiency Program— %0.1 %Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, non-GAAP36.8 %36.6 %20 31(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Other (Income) Expense, NetOther (income) expense, net was $65 and $113 in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark and goodwill and, accordingly, performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of December 31, 2021. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577. The Company continues to believe in the strength of the Filorga brand and is confident about its growth opportunities. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 32(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Operating ProfitOperating profit decreased 14% to $3,332 in 2021 from $3,885 in 2020. In 2021, Operating profit included a benefit related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil, and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges related to the Filorga reporting unit. In 2020, Operating profit included benefits resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and acquisition-related costs. Excluding these items in both periods, as applicable, Operating profit was flat in 2021. Operating profit margin was 19.1% in 2021, a decrease of 450 bps compared with 23.6% in 2020. Excluding the items described above in both periods, as applicable, Operating profit margin was 22.3% in 2021, a decrease of 120 bps from 23.5% in 2020. This decrease in Operating profit in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit (120 bps), as a percentage of Net sales.20212020% ChangeOperating profit, GAAP$3,332 $3,885 (14)%Global Growth and Efficiency Program— (16)Acquisition-related costs — 6 Value-added tax matter in Brazil(26)— Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges571 — Operating profit, non-GAAP$3,877 $3,875 — %20212020Basis Point ChangeOperating profit margin, GAAP19.1 %23.6 %(450)Global Growth and Efficiency Program— (0.1)%Acquisition-related costs — — Value-added tax matter in Brazil(0.2)%— Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges3.4 %— Operating profit margin, non-GAAP22.3 %23.5 %(120)Non-Service Related Postretirement CostsNon-service related postretirement costs were $70 in 2021 compared to $74 in 2020. 33(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest (Income) Expense, NetInterest (income) expense, net was $175 in 2021 compared with $164 in 2020.

(2) The impact of non-GAAP items on the Company’s effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment on Income before income taxes and Provision for income taxes.The provision for income taxes for 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. As described more fully below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded by the Company in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the TCJA.As part of the previously recorded charge for the TCJA, the Company had provided for foreign withholding taxes expected to be paid on the remittance of earnings from certain overseas subsidiaries no longer deemed indefinitely reinvested. As a result of a reorganization of the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries, the Company determined that no withholding taxes will be due on the remittance by certain subsidiaries of earnings previously deemed reinvested and, accordingly, reversed $45 of previously recorded foreign withholding taxes in the first quarter of 2020.Also as part of the previously recorded charge for the TCJA, the Company provided a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to foreign tax credit carry-forwards that the Company did not expect to be able to use due to changes made by the TCJA. As a result of a new operating structure implemented within one of the Company’s divisions, the Company believes the use of these foreign tax credit carry-forwards will not be limited in the future and, accordingly, reversed the previously recorded valuation allowance of $26 in the first quarter of 2020.The effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the Company’s global business initiatives.35(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per shareNet income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company of $2,166, or $2.55 per share on a diluted basis, in 2021 decreased from $2,695, or $3.14 per share on a diluted basis, in 2020. In 2021, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company included aftertax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, an aftertax benefit related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil and an aftertax loss on the early extinguishment of debt. In 2020, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company included aftertax benefits resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, aftertax acquisition-related costs, a tax benefit related to subsidiary and operating structure initiatives and an aftertax loss on the early extinguishment of debt.Excluding the items described above in both periods, as applicable, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company increased 3% to $2,719 in 2021 from $2,633 in 2020, and Earnings per common share on a diluted basis increased 5% to $3.21 in 2021 from $3.06 in 2020.2021Income Before Income TaxesProvision For Income Taxes(1)Net Income Including Noncontrolling InterestsLess: Income Attributable To Noncontrolling InterestsNet Income Attributable to Colgate-Palmolive CompanyDiluted Earnings Per Share(2)As Reported GAAP$3,087 $749 $2,338 $172 $2,166 $2.55 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges571 53 518 — 518 0.61 Loss on early extinguishment of debt75 20 55 — 55 0.07 Value-added tax matter in Brazil(26)(6)(20)— (20)(0.02)Non-GAAP$3,707 $816 $2,891 $172 $2,719 $3.21 2020Income Before Income TaxesProvision For Income Taxes(1)Net Income Including Noncontrolling InterestsLess: Income Attributable To Noncontrolling InterestsNet Income Attributable to Colgate-Palmolive CompanyDiluted Earnings Per Share(2)As Reported GAAP$3,647 $787 $2,860 $165 $2,695 $3.14 Global Growth and Efficiency Program(16)(3)(13)— (13)(0.02)Subsidiary and operating structure initiatives— 71 (71)— (71)(0.08)Acquisition-related costs6 2 4 — 4 — Loss on early extinguishment of debt23 5 18 — 18 0.02 Non-GAAP$3,660 $862 $2,798 $165 $2,633 $3.06 _______(1) The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.(2) The impact of non-GAAP adjustments on diluted earnings per share may not necessarily equal the difference between “GAAP” and “non-GAAP” as a result of rounding.36(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Segment ResultsThe Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.Oral, Personal and Home Care North America 20212020% ChangeNet sales$3,694 $3,741 (1.0)%Operating profit$754 $988 (24)%% of Net sales20.4 %26.4 %(600)bpsNet sales in North America decreased 1.0% in 2021 to $3,694, driven by volume declines of 4.0%, partially offset by net selling price increases of 2.0% and positive foreign exchange of 1.0%. Organic sales in North America decreased 2.0% in 2021. The organic sales decline was largely driven by the United States.The decrease in organic sales in North America in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to decreases in Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The decrease in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales declines in the liquid hand soap and bar soap categories. The decrease in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales declines in the hand dish category, partially offset by organic sales growth in the liquid cleaner category. Operating profit in North America decreased 24% in 2021 to $754, or 600 bps to 20.4% as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit (330 bps) and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (300 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (600 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (190 bps) and higher pricing. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher overhead expenses (290 bps), primarily driven by higher logistics costs, and increased advertising investment (10 bps). 37(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Latin America 20212020% ChangeNet sales$3,663 $3,418 7.0 %Operating profit$1,012 $975 4 %% of Net sales27.6 %28.5 %(90)bpsNet sales in Latin America increased 7.0% in 2021 to $3,663, as volume growth of 1.0% and net selling price increases of 7.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 1.0%.

The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the fabric softener and liquid cleaner categories. Operating profit in Latin America increased 4% in 2021 to $1,012, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 90 bps to 27.6%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (150 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (20 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (740 bps), which were partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (330 bps) and higher pricing. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment (70 bps), partially offset by higher overhead expenses (50 bps), primarily driven by higher logistics costs. The decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a value added tax refund.38(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Europe 20212020% ChangeNet sales$2,841 $2,747 3.5 %Operating profit$682 $652 5 %% of Net sales24.0 %23.7 %30 bpsNet sales in Europe increased 3.5% in 2021 to $2,841, as Net selling prices were flat and positive foreign exchange of 4.0% was partially offset by volume declines of 0.5%.

The program is intended to reallocate resources towards the Company’s strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in the Company’s operations and streamline the Company’s supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2022, is projected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $200 and $240, which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Annualized pre-tax savings are projected to be in the range of $90 to $110. 44(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is provided below.Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Interest (income) expense, net, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding, as applicable, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, a benefit related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil, the benefits resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a benefit related to a reorganization of the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries and a new operating structure implemented within one of the Company’s divisions, acquisition-related costs and losses on the early extinguishment of debt. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain acquisitions, divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.45(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of Net sales growth to organic sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2021Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America(1.0)%1.0%—%(2.0)%Latin America7.0%(1.0)%—%8.0%Europe3.5%4.0%—%(0.5)%Asia Pacific6.0%3.0%—%3.0%Africa/Eurasia6.5%(0.5)%—%7.0%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care4.0%1.5%—%2.5%Pet Nutrition15.0%1.5%—%13.5%Total Company6.0%1.5%—%4.5%Year ended December 31, 2020Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America9.5%—%1.5%8.0%Latin America(5.0)%(14.0)%—%9.0%Europe12.0%1.5%7.5%3.0%Asia Pacific(0.5)%(1.0)%—%0.5%Africa/Eurasia—%(8.5)%1.0%7.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care3.0%(5.0)%2.0%6.0%Pet Nutrition14.0%(0.5)%—%14.5%Total Company5.0%(3.5)%1.5%7.0%Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. In particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as eCommerce or certain discounters. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In certain limited circumstances, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the ability of our third-party vendors to provide the Company with reliable updated market share data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.46(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations decreased to $3,325 in 2021 as compared to $3,719 in 2020, primarily due to changes in working capital. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (2.7)% in 2021 and (4.4)% in 2020. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales is primarily due to lower accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts payable and higher prepaid expenses. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Investing activities used $592 of cash in 2021 compared to $779 during 2020. Investing activities in 2020 included the acquisition of hello for cash consideration of $351 as part of the Company’s continued strategy to focus on the high growth segments within its Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. This acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash.Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $567, an increase from $410 in 2020. Capital expenditures increased in 2021 primarily due to capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and sustainability projects. Capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be approximately 4.0% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns.Financing activities used $2,774 of cash during 2021 compared to $2,919 during 2020. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in net payments on debt, partially offset by higher share repurchases, net in 2021 as compared to 2020.In 2020, as a result of the incremental debt related to recent acquisitions, net of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, the Company moderated its share repurchases, net. In addition, due to the initial uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and our intent to preserve cash, the Company discontinued all share repurchases other than those pursuant to equity plans during the second quarter of 2020. The Company resumed its share repurchases, at a moderated level, net in the third quarter of 2020. Share repurchases, net returned to historical levels in 2021.Long-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $7,206 as of December 31, 2021, as compared to $7,343 as of December 31, 2020, and total debt decreased to $7,245 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to $7,601 as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s debt issuances and redemptions support the Company’s capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company issued €500 of eight-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.300% (the “Sustainability Bond”). The debt issuance was under the Company’s shelf registration statement. An amount equal to the net proceeds of the Sustainability Bond will be used to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and existing projects and programs with distinct environmental or social benefits pursuant to the Company’s Sustainable Financing Framework. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed prior to maturity all of its outstanding 0.000% notes due 2021 with a principal amount of €500, originally issued on November 12, 2019. The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings. The redemption price was equal to the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.In 1990, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary (“CP Canada”), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the “Canada notes”). During the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75, which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.47(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company redeemed prior to maturity all of its outstanding 2.450% notes due 2021 with a principal amount of $300, originally issued on November 8, 2011, and all of its outstanding 2.300% notes due 2022 with a principal amount of $500, originally issued on May 3, 2012. These redemptions were financed with commercial paper borrowings and cash. The Company recorded a loss on this early extinguishment of debt of $23, which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.At December 31, 2021, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,457 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In August 2021, the Company entered into a new $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for a five-year term expiring August 2026, which replaced, on substantially similar terms, the Company’s $2,650 revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in November 2024. Commitment fees related to the credit facility were not material. The Company’s $1,500 364-day credit facility with a syndicate of banks expired in August 2021 and was not renewed.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $1,204 and $1,389 as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2021 and 2020 were $2,052 and $1,050, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its available lines of credit (under the facilities discussed above).The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2021 and 2020: 20212020 Weighted Average Interest RateMaturitiesOutstandingWeighted Average Interest RateMaturitiesOutstandingGlobal short-term borrowings0.7 %2022$39 4.8 %2021$8 Commercial Paper (1)(0.4)%20221,204 (0.3)%20211,389 Total$1,243 $1,397 (1) Commercial paper included a current portion of $250, included in Notes and loans payable, as of December 31, 2020. Certain of the agreements with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. Refer to Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2021 were $1,679, an increase from $1,654 in 2020. Dividend payments increased to $1.79 per share in 2021 from $1.75 per share in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company increased the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.45 per share from $0.44 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2021. The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On June 18, 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under the 2018 Program. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs. The shares are repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the Company’s discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors.Aggregate share repurchases in 2021 consisted of approximately 16.4 million common shares under the 2018 Program and 0.3 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,320. Aggregate repurchases in 2020 consisted of approximately 18.2 million common shares under the 2018 Program 48(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)and 0.4 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,476. Share repurchases net of proceeds from exercise of stock options were $896 and $602 in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Cash and cash equivalents decreased $56 during 2021 to $832 at December 31, 2021, compared to $888 at December 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries was $784 and $872, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and 2020.The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021: Total20222023202420252026ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion(1)$6,002 $456 $908 $506 $135 $566 $3,431 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2)1,391 109 99 83 72 65 963 Operating Leases685 156 109 76 61 48 235 Purchase obligations(3)724 421 171 90 22 19 1 U.S. tax reform payments 210 25 46 62 77 — — Total$9,012 $1,167 $1,333 $817 $367 $698 $4,630 _______(1)The Company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next 12 months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The amounts in this table exclude such obligations.(2)Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(3)The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2021 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2021. The Company does not expect to make any voluntary contributions to its U.S. postretirement plans in 2022. In addition, total benefit payments expected to be paid from the Company’s assets to participants in unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately $89 for the year ending December 31, 2022.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.49(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See “Results of Operations” above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $12 and net unrealized loss of $11 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2021, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $76.50(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2021 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $14 in 2021. The Company is assessing the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements, including debt outstanding, and believes it will not be material as the Company does not have significant exposure to LIBOR in either its debt or other financing arrangements. The Company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $2 and $3 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At the end of 2021, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832).” This ASU requires increased disclosure on an annual basis about transactions with domestic, foreign, local, regional and national governments, including entities related to those governments and intergovernmental organizations, that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2022 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASU No. 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.” This ASU clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. This guidance was effective upon issuance for the Company and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.51(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-10, “Codification Improvements.” This ASU improves the consistency of the codification topics by including all disclosure guidance in the appropriate disclosure section and also clarifies the application of various provisions in the codification.

This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, “Income taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method (25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2021 or 2020 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company’s Gross profit margin would have been lower by 968 bps in 2021, by 845 bps in 2020, and 810 bps in 2019, with no impact on reported earnings. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves.52(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 2.98% and 2.65% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 3.06%, and 2.88% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 5.70% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return.Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 3%, 8%, 8%, 6% and 7%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 76% in fixed income securities, 21% in equity securities and 3% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $18. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans and U.S. other retiree benefit plan would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $2 and $10, respectively. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 6.00% for 2022, declining to 4.75% by 2026 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $11.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $11.11. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 4%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%. The Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. The Monte-Carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the Black-Scholes model.▪Goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.53(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Determining the fair value of the Company’s reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate. Estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. In selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the Company considers recent market transactions for similar brands and products. In determining an appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. Other qualitative factors the Company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.In determining the fair value of the Company’s reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. As multiple valuation methodologies are used, the Company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share, brand history, future expansion expectations, the level of in-market support anticipated by management, legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold. The Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Filorga reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark and goodwill and, accordingly, performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of December 31, 2021. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577. Except for the Filorga skin health business, as described above, the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. The fair value of the Company’s indefinite-life intangible assets other than Filorga exceeds their recorded carrying value by at least 20%. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets.▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.54(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.55(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin levels, earnings per share levels, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, the impact of COVID-19, cost-reduction plans (including the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative), tax rates, new product introductions, commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain economic and political environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, foreign currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, sanctions, tariffs, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws, or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, including changes in trade, tax and immigration policies, increased competition and evolving competitive practices (including from the growth of eCommerce and the entry of new competitors and business models), the ability to operate and respond effectively during a pandemic, epidemic or widespread public health concern, including COVID-19, ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities, ability to manage the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials and logistics costs, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels, the growth of eCommerce and the rapidly changing retail landscape (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications), the ability to develop innovative new products, the ability to lower costs, successfully implement the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and drive growth and instill a growth mindset to drive innovation, the ability to maintain the security of our information technology systems from a cyber-security incident or data breach, the ability to lessen and address the effects of climate change and achieve our sustainability and social impact targets, the ability to complete acquisitions and divestitures as planned, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, the ability to attract and retain key employees and integrate DE&I initiatives across our organization, the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit, and the ability to address uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions, disruptions in the credit markets and tax matters. For information about these and other factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”ITEM 7A.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2023,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive OverviewBusiness OrganizationColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Colgate”) is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling products globally that make people’s and their pets’ lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) strategies across our organization.We are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.Operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approximately two-thirds of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers, distributors, dentists and skin health professionals. Through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. We also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the Company’s use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Market Share Information” below.25(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have had and continue to have an impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and may in the future experience “stay at home” orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to address the pandemic. While the impact of COVID-19 on our business has largely abated at this time, uncertainties continue, particularly in China where we have substantial manufacturing facilities and business, and in the travel retail channel, where we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions particularly in our Filorga business. We have also experienced certain disruptions to our global supply chain due to COVID-19, which have impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. In addition, we have witnessed changes in the purchasing patterns of our customers, including a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. COVID-19 may continue to impact consumers’ behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences.While we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above, uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 could result in unforeseen additional disruptions to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs.For more information about the anticipated COVID-19 impact, see “Outlook” below.The War in UkraineThe war in Ukraine, and the related geopolitical tensions, have had and continue to have a significant impact on our operations in Ukraine and Russia, though it has not been material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The safety of our employees and partners in Ukraine has been and remains our first priority. While our ability to do business in Ukraine has been significantly impacted, we remain committed to rebuilding our business there and to providing access to essential products to people in the region. We have suspended the importation and sales of all products in Russia other than essential health and hygiene products for everyday use and ceased all capital investments and media activities in Russia. While these actions have impacted our Eurasia business, they have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. In 2022, our Eurasia business constituted approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 3% of our consolidated operating profit (the majority of which was Russia). We also continue to monitor the impact of sanctions and export controls imposed in response to the war in Ukraine. The situation is rapidly evolving and significant uncertainties remain regarding the full impact of the war and the related impact on the global economy and geopolitical relations generally, and on our business in particular. We have seen and expect to continue to see the war’s impact on the global economy and our business including, among other things, the cost of raw and packaging materials and commodities (including the price of oil and natural gas), supply chain and logistics challenges and foreign currency volatility. For more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to the war in Ukraine, refer to Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.26(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Business StrategyTo achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through science-led, core and premium innovation; pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments; expanding in faster-growing channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&I strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. We are strengthening and leveraging our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, eCommerce and data and analytics, enabling us to be more responsive in today’s rapidly changing world. In particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.We are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.The investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. Significant Items Impacting ComparabilityDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a non-cash charge of $721 pretax ($620 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets related to the Filorga skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business, particularly in China, as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels, and the impact of significantly higher interest rates. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.On September 30, 2022, the Company acquired a business for a purchase price, as adjusted, of $719, which operates three dry pet food manufacturing plants in the United States, from Red Collar Pet Foods Holdings, Inc. and Red Collar Pet Foods Holdings, L.P. (collectively, “Red Collar Pet Foods”) to further support the global growth of the Hill’s Pet Nutrition business. See Note 3, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In July 2022, one of the Company’s subsidiaries in Asia Pacific completed the sale of land and recognized a pretax gain of $47 ($15 aftertax attributable to the Company).On January 27, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a targeted productivity program (the “2022 Global Productivity Initiative”). The program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by mid-year 2024, is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, in the range of $200 to $240 ($170 to $200 aftertax). Annualized pretax savings are projected to be in the range of $90 to $110 ($70 to $85 aftertax), once all projects are approved and implemented. For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred pretax costs of $110 (aftertax costs of $87) resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative.27(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Filorga skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In 1990, our Canadian subsidiary (“CP Canada”), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the “Canada notes”). In the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.In 2019, we received a favorable judgment regarding certain value-added tax previously paid in Brazil. As a result of this favorable judgment, the Company filed an application with the Brazilian government to recover value-added tax previously paid and recorded a benefit. In May 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a clarifying ruling allowing a higher deduction of state value-added tax when determining the taxable base. In light of this ruling, we recorded an additional benefit of $26 pretax ($20 aftertax) in the year ended December 31, 2021.28(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)OutlookLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates. During the year ended December 31, 2022, all of our divisions experienced significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. We also incurred increased logistics costs due to volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry, higher eCommerce demand and the war in Ukraine. We expect this difficult cost environment to continue in 2023. We are taking additional pricing to try to offset these increases in raw and packaging materials and logistics costs. This may, in turn, negatively impact consumer demand for our products. Additionally, inflation is impacting the broader economy with consumers around the world facing widespread rising prices as well as rising interest rates resulting from measures to address inflation. Such inflation and rising interest rates may negatively impact consumer consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to “private label” or lower-priced product offerings. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. In light of this challenging environment, we expect increased volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term.Given that approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations. As discussed above, we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material and logistics costs. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and our funding-the-growth and revenue growth management initiatives, including additional pricing, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. Should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results.While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. We have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory destocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and certain sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of eCommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. We plan to continue to invest behind our digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses. The substantial growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.We continue to closely monitor the impact of the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 and the challenging market conditions discussed above on our business and the related uncertainties and risks. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of these conditions, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of their impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. For more information about factors that could impact our business, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain, dedicated and diverse global team and focused business strategy. Our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through science-led, core and premium innovation; pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments, expanding in faster growing channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&I strategies. Our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to profitability and driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges we face and increase shareholder value over time.29(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of OperationsThis section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.Net SalesWorldwide Net sales were $17,967 in 2022, up 3.0% from 2021, due to net selling price increases of 9.5%, partially offset by volume declines of 2.0% and negative foreign exchange of 4.5%. Acquisitions contributed 0.5% to volume. Organic sales (Net sales excluding, as applicable, the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure as discussed below, increased 7.0% in 2022.Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment were $14,254 in 2022, up 1.0% from 2021, due to net selling price increases of 9.0%, partially offset by volume declines of 3.5%, and negative foreign exchange of 4.5%. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment increased 5.5% in 2022.The increase in organic sales in 2022 versus 2021 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste and manual toothbrush categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories, partially offset by organic sales declines in the skin care category. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the fabric softener and surface cleaner categories.The Company’s share of the global toothpaste market was 39.8% for full year 2022, up 0.5 share points from full year 2021, and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 31.7% for full year 2022, up 0.7 share points from full year 2021.

Acquisitions contributed 2.5% to volume. Organic sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 13.0% in 2022.The increase in organic sales in 2022 versus 2021 was due to increases in organic sales in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.30(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Gross Profit/MarginWorldwide Gross profit decreased 1% to $10,248 in 2022 from $10,375 in 2021, reflecting a decrease of $452 resulting from lower Gross profit margin and an increase of $325 resulting from higher Net sales.Worldwide Gross profit margin decreased to 57.0% in 2022 from 59.6% in 2021. This decrease in Gross profit margin was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (810 bps), partially offset by higher pricing (360 bps) and cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (220 bps).20222021Gross profit$10,248 $10,375 20222021Basis Point ChangeGross profit margin57.0 %59.6 %(260)31(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 2% to $6,565 in 2022 from $6,407 in 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2022 included charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative. Excluding charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $6,560 in 2022 from $6,407 in 2021, reflecting higher overhead expenses of $177 and decreased advertising investment of $24.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales decreased to 36.5% in 2022 from 36.8% in 2021. This decrease was due to decreased advertising investment (50 bps), partially offset by higher overhead expenses (20 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. Higher overhead expenses were driven by higher logistics costs (70 bps), partially offset by overhead efficiencies (50 bps). In 2022, advertising investment decreased as a percentage of Net sales to 11.1% from 11.6% in 2021 and decreased by 1.2% in absolute terms to $1,997 as compared with $2,021 in 2021.20222021Selling, general and administrative expenses, GAAP$6,565 $6,407 2022 Global Productivity Initiative(5)— Selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP$6,560 $6,407 20222021Basis Point ChangeSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales36.5 %36.8 %(30)32(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Other (Income) Expense, NetOther (income) expense, net was $69 and $65 in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit and the impact of significantly higher interest rates triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark, goodwill and long-lived assets which consists primarily of customer relationships. As a result of the interim impairment test, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark and customer relationships exceeded their estimated fair value and recorded impairment charges of $300 and $89, respectively, reducing their carrying values to $257 and $118, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademark and customer relationship intangible assets, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $332 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to $214 as of December 31, 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Filorga reporting unit due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. The Company performed an impairment review and concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577. The Company continues to believe in the strength of the Filorga brand and is confident about its growth opportunities. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 33(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Operating ProfitOperating profit decreased 13% to $2,893 in 2022 from $3,332 in 2021. In 2022, Operating profit included goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges related to the Filorga reporting unit, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, a gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific and acquisition-related costs. In 2021, Operating profit included goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges related to the Filorga reporting unit and a benefit related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil. Excluding these items in both periods, as applicable, Operating profit decreased 5% to $3,681 in 2022 from $3,877 in 2021. Operating profit margin was 16.1% in 2022, a decrease of 300 bps compared with 19.1% in 2021. Excluding the items described above in both periods, as applicable, Operating profit margin was 20.5% in 2022, a decrease of 180 bps from 22.3% in 2021. This decrease in Operating profit in 2022 was due to a decrease in Gross profit (260 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (50 bps) and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales.20222021% ChangeOperating profit, GAAP$2,893 $3,332 (13)%Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges721 571 2022 Global Productivity Initiative95 — Gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific(47)— Acquisition-related costs19 — Value-added tax matter in Brazil— (26)Operating profit, non-GAAP$3,681 $3,877 (5)%20222021Basis Point ChangeOperating profit margin, GAAP16.1 %19.1 %(300)Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges4.0 %3.4 %2022 Global Productivity Initiative0.5 %— %Gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific(0.2)%— %Acquisition-related costs0.1 %— %Value-added tax matter in Brazil— %(0.2)%Operating profit margin, non-GAAP20.5 %22.3 %(180)Non-Service Related Postretirement CostsNon-service related postretirement costs were $80 in 2022 compared to $70 in 2021.

(2) The impact of non-GAAP items on the Company’s effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment on Income before income taxes and Provision for income taxes.The increase in the Company’s full year effective tax rate before discrete period items is primarily driven by the impact of recently finalized U.S. tax regulations, which place greater restrictions on foreign taxes that are creditable against U.S. taxes on foreign-sourced income.The effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the Company's global business initiatives.On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted, which among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations effective for years beginning after December 31, 2022. Based on the Company’s preliminary analysis, the IRA is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of this law as additional guidance and clarification becomes available.Additionally, on December 15, 2022, the 27 member states of the European Union (“EU”) reached an agreement on a minimum level of taxation for certain large corporations to pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% in every jurisdiction in which they operate. This agreement, which is known as the Minimum Taxation Directive, must be transposed into the laws of all EU member states by December 31, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this Directive on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. All U.S. federal income tax returns through December 31, 2013 have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and there are limited matters which the Company plans to appeal for years 2010 through 2013. One such matter relates to the IRS assessment of taxes on the Company by imputing income on certain activities within one of our international operations. In light of a recent U.S. Tax Court ruling subsequent to December 31, 2022 in favor of the IRS against an unrelated party on a similar 36(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)matter, the Company is in the process of reassessing its position as it relates to this matter. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS, where the same matter is being discussed, for the years 2014 through 2018. The amount of tax plus interest for the years 2010 through 2018 is estimated to be approximately $145, which is not included in our uncertain tax positions. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s tax matters.Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per shareNet income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company was $1,785, or $2.13 per share on a diluted basis, in 2022, a decrease from $2,166, or $2.55 per share on a diluted basis, in 2021. In 2022, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company included goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, a gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific and acquisition-related costs. In 2021, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company included goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a benefit related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil.Excluding the items described above in both periods, as applicable, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company decreased 8% to $2,493 in 2022 from $2,719 in 2021, and Earnings per common share on a diluted basis decreased 7% to $2.97 in 2022 from $3.21 in 2021.2022Income Before Income TaxesProvision For Income Taxes(1)Net Income Including Noncontrolling InterestsLess: Income Attributable To Noncontrolling InterestsNet Income Attributable to Colgate-Palmolive CompanyDiluted Earnings Per Share(2)As Reported GAAP$2,660 $693 $1,967 $182 $1,785 $2.13 Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges721 101 620 — 620 0.74 2022 Global Productivity Initiative110 22 88 1 87 0.10 Gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific(47)(11)(36)(21)(15)(0.02)Acquisition-related costs19 3 16 — 16 0.02 Non-GAAP$3,463 $808 $2,655 $162 $2,493 $2.97 2021Income Before Income TaxesProvision For Income Taxes(1)Net Income Including Noncontrolling InterestsLess: Income Attributable To Noncontrolling InterestsNet Income Attributable to Colgate-Palmolive CompanyDiluted Earnings Per Share(2)As Reported GAAP$3,087 $749 $2,338 $172 $2,166 $2.55 Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges571 53 518 — 518 0.61 Loss on early extinguishment of debt75 20 55 — 55 0.07 Value-added tax matters in Brazil(26)(6)(20)— (20)(0.02)Non-GAAP$3,707 $816 $2,891 $172 $2,719 $3.21 _______(1) The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.(2) The impact of non-GAAP adjustments on diluted earnings per share may not necessarily equal the difference between “GAAP” and “non-GAAP” as a result of rounding.37(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Segment ResultsThe Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.Oral, Personal and Home Care North America 20222021% ChangeNet sales$3,816 $3,694 3.5 %Operating profit$761 $754 1 %% of Net sales19.9 %20.4 %(50)bpsNet sales in North America increased 3.5% in 2022 to $3,816, driven by net selling price increases of 5.5%, partially offset by volume declines of 2.0%, while foreign exchange was flat. Organic sales in North America increased 3.5% in 2022. The organic sales growth was led by the United States.The increase in organic sales in North America in 2022 versus 2021 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste and manual toothbrush categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and liquid hand soap categories, partially offset by organic sales declines in the skin care category. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the surface cleaner and hand dish categories.Operating profit in North America increased 1% in 2022 to $761, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 50 bps to 19.9%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit (60 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (40 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (550 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (220 bps) and higher pricing. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to lower overhead expenses (40 bps), as overhead efficiencies (60 bps) more than offset higher logistics costs (20 bps). 38(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Latin America 20222021% ChangeNet sales$3,982 $3,663 8.5 %Operating profit$1,108 $1,012 10 %% of Net sales27.8 %27.6 %20 bpsNet sales in Latin America increased 8.5% in 2022 to $3,982, driven by net selling price increases of 15.5%, partially offset by volume declines of 5.0% and negative foreign exchange of 2.0%. Organic sales in Latin America increased 10.5% in 2022. Organic sales growth was led by Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. The increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2022 versus 2021 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste and manual toothbrush categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the surface cleaner and fabric softener categories. Operating profit in Latin America increased 10% in 2022 to $1,108, or 20 bps to 27.8% as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (40 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (140 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Gross profit (160 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (1,040 bps), which were partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (290 bps). This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment (20 bps) and lower overhead expenses (20 bps), as overhead efficiencies (60 bps) more than offset higher logistics costs (40 bps). This decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to gains from marketable securities and other assets, and a value-added tax refund.39(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Europe 20222021% ChangeNet sales$2,548 $2,841 (10.5)%Operating profit$514 $682 (25)%% of Net sales20.2 %24.0 %(380)bpsNet sales in Europe decreased 10.5% in 2022 to $2,548, as volume declines of 4.0% and negative foreign exchange of 10.5% were partially offset by net selling price increases of 4.0%.

The program is intended to reallocate resources towards the Company’s strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in the Company’s operations and streamline the Company’s supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by mid-year 2024, is estimated to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, in the range of $200 to $240 ($170 to $200 aftertax), which is currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 80% to 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Annualized pre-tax savings are projected to be in the range of $90 to $110 ($70 to $85 aftertax), once all projects are approved and implemented. It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (5%), Latin America (10%), Europe (45%), Asia Pacific (5%), Africa/Eurasia (10%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (10%) and Corporate (15%).

The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is provided below.Selling, general and administrative expenses, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Interest (income) expense, net, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding, as applicable, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, a gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific, acquisition-related costs, a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a benefit related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain other unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.47(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of Net sales growth to organic sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2022Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America3.5%—%—%3.5%Latin America8.5%(2.0)%—%10.5%Europe(10.5)%(10.5)%—%—%Asia Pacific(1.5)%(6.5)%—%5.0%Africa/Eurasia3.5%(8.5)%—%12.0%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care1.0%(4.5)%—%5.5%Pet Nutrition12.0%(3.5)%2.5%13.0%Total Company3.0%(4.5)%0.5%7.0%Year ended December 31, 2021Net Sales Growth(GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpact OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America(1.0)%1.0%—%(2.0)%Latin America7.0%(1.0)%—%8.0%Europe3.5%4.0%—%(0.5)%Asia Pacific6.0%3.0%—%3.0%Africa/Eurasia6.5%(0.5)%—%7.0%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care4.0%1.5%—%2.5%Pet Nutrition15.0%1.5%—%13.5%Total Company6.0%1.5%—%4.5%Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. In particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as eCommerce or certain discounters. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.48(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations decreased to $2,556 in 2022 as compared to $3,325 in 2021, primarily due to changes in working capital and lower net income. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was 1.0% in 2022 and (2.7)% in 2021. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales is primarily due to higher inventory (driven by higher raw and packaging material costs and increased levels to mitigate the risk of supply chain and logistics disruptions), higher accounts receivable, and lower accounts payable and accruals. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Investing activities used $1,601 of cash in 2022 compared to $592 during 2021. Investing activities in 2022 included the Company’s acquisition of businesses from Red Collar Pet Foods and Nutriamo discussed in Note 3, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2022 were $696, an increase from $567 in 2021. Capital expenditures increased in 2022 primarily due to capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and sustainability projects. Capital expenditures for 2023 are expected to be approximately 4.0% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns.Financing activities used $952 of cash during 2022 compared to $2,774 during 2021. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the proceeds from debt issuances in 2022 to fund acquisitions as compared to 2021.Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $8,755 as of December 31, 2022, as compared to $7,206 as of December 31, 2021, and total debt increased to $8,766 as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $7,245 as of December 31, 2021. The Company’s debt issuances and redemptions support the Company’s capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.During the third quarter of 2022, the Company issued $500 of three-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 3.100%, $500 of five-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 3.100% and $500 of ten-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 3.250%. The debt issuances were under the Company’s shelf registration statement.During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company issued €500 of eight-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.300% (the “Sustainability Bond”). The debt issuance was under the Company’s shelf registration statement. An amount equal to the net proceeds of the Sustainability Bond was allocated to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and existing projects and programs with distinct environmental or social benefits pursuant to the Company’s Sustainable Financing Framework during the period from January 1, 2020 through July 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed prior to maturity all of its outstanding 0.000% notes due 2021 with a principal amount of €500, originally issued on November 12, 2019. The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings. The redemption price was equal to the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.In 1990, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary (“CP Canada”), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the “Canada notes”). During the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75, which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.At December 31, 2022, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,401 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. 49(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In November 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for a five-year term expiring November 2027, which replaced, on substantially similar terms, the Company's $3,000 revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in August 2026. Commitment fees related to the credit facility were not material. Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $1,778 and $1,204 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2022 and 2021 were $1,858 and $2,052, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its available lines of credit (under the facilities discussed above).The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 20222021 Weighted Average Interest RateMaturitiesOutstandingWeighted Average Interest RateMaturitiesOutstandingCommercial Paper2.1 %20231,778 (0.4)%20221,204 Certain of the agreements with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. Refer to Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2022 were $1,691, an increase from $1,679 in 2021. Dividend payments increased to $1.86 per share in 2022 from $1.79 per share in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company increased the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.47 per share from $0.45 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2022. The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On March 10, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5 billion under a new share repurchase program (the “2022 Program”), which replaced a previously authorized share repurchase program (the “2018 Program”). The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs. The shares are repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the Company’s discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors.Aggregate share repurchases in 2022 consisted of approximately 13.4 million common shares under the 2022 Program, 3.4 million common shares under the 2018 Program and 0.3 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,308. Aggregate repurchases in 2021 consisted of approximately 16.4 million common shares under the 2018 Program and 0.3 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,320. Share repurchases net of proceeds from exercise of stock options were $890 and $896 in 2022 and 2021, respectively.Cash and cash equivalents decreased $57 during 2022 to $775 at December 31, 2022, compared to $832 at December 31, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries was $735 and $784, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021.50(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022: Total20232024202520262027ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion(1)$6,977 $921 $510 $636 $538 $499 $3,873 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2)2,210 204 149 134 117 112 1,494 Operating Leases586 124 88 69 54 50 201 Purchase obligations(3)723 476 139 50 37 18 3 U.S. tax reform payments 185 46 62 77 — — — Total$10,681 $1,771 $948 $966 $746 $679 $5,571 _______(1)The Company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next twelve months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis.

Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(3)The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2022 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2023. The Company does not expect to make any voluntary contributions to its U.S. postretirement plans in 2023. In addition, total benefit payments expected to be paid from the Company’s assets to participants in unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately $86 for the year ending December 31, 2023.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.51(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See “Results of Operations” above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $4 and $12 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2022, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $80.52(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2022 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $14 in 2022. The Company has completed its assessment of the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements, including debt outstanding, and concluded it to be not material as the Company does not have significant exposure to LIBOR in either its debt or other financing arrangements. The Company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $1 and $2 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At the end of 2022, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2022-04, “Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.” This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs’ key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The guidance, which is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2023 (except for the roll-forward, which is effective beginning on January 1, 2024), is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.” This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The amendments also require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging-Portfolio Layer Method.” This ASU clarifies the accounting and promotes consistency in reporting for hedges where the portfolio layer method is applied. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2023 and is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.53(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832).” This ASU requires increased disclosure on an annual basis about transactions with domestic, foreign, local, regional and national governments, including entities related to those governments and intergovernmental organizations, that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2022 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASU No. 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,” which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope,” which clarified that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition due to reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,"" which defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief under Topic 848. We have completed our evaluation of significant contracts under this ASU. Certain of the reviewed contracts have been modified and the remaining reviewed contracts will be modified, where necessary, to apply a new reference rate, primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Accordingly the guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2022 or 2021 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company’s Gross profit margin would have been lower by 1,040 bps in 2022, by 970 bps in 2021, and 850 bps in 2020, with no impact on reported earnings.54(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves.▪In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.66% and 2.98% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.67% and 3.06% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 6.25% as of December 31, 2022 and 5.70% as of December 31, 2021. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return.Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were (18)%, 1%, 4%, 4% and 5%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 76% in fixed income securities, 21% in equity securities and 3% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $13. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans and U.S. other retiree benefit plan would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $2 and $1, respectively. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 6.25% for 2023, declining to 4.50% by 2027 and remaining at 4.50% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $2.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2022 was $14.71. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 6%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 4%. The Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. The Monte-Carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the Black-Scholes model.▪Goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.55(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Determining the fair value of the Company’s reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate. Estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. In selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the Company considers the long-term profitability of the brand and recent market transactions for similar brands and products. In determining an appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. Other qualitative factors the Company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.In determining the fair value of the Company’s reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. As multiple valuation methodologies are used, the Company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share, brand history, future expansion expectations, the level of in-market support anticipated by management, legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Filorga reporting unit due primarily to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in China, as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit and the impact of significantly higher interest rates triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark, goodwill and long-lived assets which consists primarily of customer relationships. As a result of the interim impairment test, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark and customer relationships exceeded their estimated fair value and recorded impairment charges of $300 and $89, respectively, reducing their carrying values to $257 and $118, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademark and customer relationship intangible assets, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $332 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to $214 as of December 31, 2022. Except for the Filorga skin health business described above, the estimated fair value of the Company’s remaining reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value. As of the date of the annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value of two of the Company’s indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets, other than Filorga, exceeded their recorded carrying values by less than 10%. The combined carrying value for these trademarks is $465 as of December 31, 2022. Either a reduction in the royalty rate of 50 basis points, a reduction in the long term sales growth rate of 50 basis points or an increase in discount rate of 50 bps would result in the fair value of each of these indefinite-lived trademarks approximating their respective carrying value. Given the inherent uncertainties of estimating the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rates and inflation on macroeconomic conditions, actual results may differ from management's current estimates which could potentially result in additional impairment charges in future periods. 56(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Filorga reporting unit due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. The Company performed an impairment review and concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577. ▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.57(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2003,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company manufactures and markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care; and Pet Nutrition. Segment performance is evaluated based on several factors, including operating profit. The Company uses operating profit as a measure of the basic health of the operating segments because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. Prior years’ segment information has been revised for new accounting requirements and certain reclassifications. Net sales were revised for the impact of the new accounting for sales incentives described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with no effect on operating profit or net income. As is also described in Note 2, the Company changed its accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002. In accordance with the new standard, prior periods were not restated. Amounts for certain businesses in the Caribbean, which were previously reported in Latin America, have been reclassified to North America to conform with current year presentation and change in management responsibilities. Results of Operations 2002 2001 2000 Worldwide Net Sales by Business Segment and Geographic Region Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care North America(1) $ 2,374.1 $ 2,299.9 $ 2,216.5 Latin America 2,206.8 2,356.0 2,406.6 Europe 1,984.3 1,835.0 1,825.8 Asia/Africa 1,542.0 1,484.3 1,496.6 Total Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care 8,107.2 7,975.2 7,945.5 Total Pet Nutrition(2) 1,187.1 1,109.1 1,058.9 Net Sales $ 9,294.3 $ 9,084.3 $ 9,004.4 (1) Net sales in the U.S. for Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care were $2,030.4, $1,976.7 and $1,896.7 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. (2) Net sales in the U.S. for Pet Nutrition were $714.5, $661.5 and $633.9 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 7 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Net Sales Worldwide net sales increased 2.5% to $9,294.3 in 2002 on volume growth of 4.5%. Net sales would have grown 5.0% excluding foreign currency translation. Net sales in the Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care segment increased 2.0%, excluding divestitures, on 4.5% volume growth; while net sales in Pet Nutrition increased by 7.0% on 5.5% volume growth. In 2001, worldwide net sales, excluding divestitures, increased 2.0% to $9,084.3 on volume growth of 5.0%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Gross Profit Gross profit margin increased to 54.6%, above both the 2001 level of 53.4% and the 2000 level of 52.7%. This favorable trend reflects the Company’s strategy to improve all aspects of its supply chain through global sourcing, regionalization of manufacturing facilities and other cost-reduction initiatives, as well as its emphasis on higher margin products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 32.6% in 2002, 32.1% in 2001 and 32.8% in 2000. The increase in 2002 was primarily driven by pension and other employee benefit costs that were partially offset by the benefit of ongoing cost-savings initiatives. In 2001, the overall spending as a percentage of sales decreased as a result of the Company’s ongoing focus on overhead reduction and the effect of translation on local currency costs. Total advertising support behind Colgate brands, including media, promotion and other consumer and trade incentives, some of which reduce reported sales, has increased by 8%, 1% and 3% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is media spending of $486.6, $509.0 and $550.9 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The trend in media spending reflects lower media pricing, the negative impact of foreign exchange and a slight shift in investment to other forms of total advertising support. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net, consists principally of minority interest in earnings of less-than-100%-owned consolidated subsidiaries, amortization of intangible assets, earnings from equity investments, gains and losses on interest rate and foreign currency hedge contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, and other miscellaneous gains and losses. During 2002, other expense, net, decreased from $94.5 to $23.0 resulting from the benefit of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets and changes in the fair value of foreign currency contracts. These contracts are an economic hedge of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting. During 2001, other expense, net, increased from $52.3 to $94.5 primarily due to changes in the fair value of foreign currency contracts. During 2000, the Company recorded charges of $92.7 ($61.2 aftertax) in other expense, net, including a restructuring charge related to the realignment of certain manufacturing operations and the exiting of its business in Nigeria. Also included were gains of $102.0 ($60.9 aftertax) recorded on the sale of real estate and the sale of the Viva detergent brand in Mexico. Operating Profit Operating profit rose 10% to $2,013.1 in 2002 from $1,834.8 in 2001, which had reflected a 5% increase from 2000 operating profit of $1,740.5. The continued increase resulted from strong volume growth and cost-saving initiatives. If prior year results were adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, operating profit would have been $1,889.1 and $1,800.2 for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net, was $142.8 compared with $166.1 in 2001 and $173.3 in 2000. This decreasing trend is the result of lower interest rates partially offset by increased average debt levels related to share repurchases during the year. 8 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Income Taxes The effective tax rate on income was 31.1% in 2002 versus 31.3% in 2001 and 32.1% in 2000. If 2001 and 2000 had been adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, the respective tax rates would have been 30.9% and 31.7%. Global tax planning strategies, including the realization of tax credits and incentives, reduced the effective tax rate in all three years presented. Net Income Net income was $1,288.3 in 2002 or $2.19 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,146.6 in 2001 or $1.89 per share and $1,063.8 in 2000 or $1.70 per share. If results for 2001 and 2000 were adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, net income and diluted earnings per share would have been $1,190.4 and $1.96, respectively, for 2001 and $1,111.6 and $1.77, respectively, for 2000. Segment Results 2002 2001 2000 Worldwide Operating Profit by Business Segment andGeographic Region Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care North America $ 578.7 $ 516.6 $ 487.9 Latin America 647.4 663.2 597.6 Europe 409.0 342.6 320.0 Asia/Africa 232.6 195.9 194.0 Total Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care 1,867.7 1,718.3 1,599.5 Total Pet Nutrition 318.3 282.1 243.5 Total Corporate (172.9 ) (165.6 ) (102.5 ) Operating Profit $ 2,013.1 $ 1,834.8 $ 1,740.5 North America North America net sales grew 3.0% to $2,374.1 on volume gains of 6.0%. Volume increases were led by the strength of recently introduced products in all core categories. In the Oral Care category, innovative products such as Colgate Simply White at-home tooth whitening gel, Colgate Total Plus Whitening toothpaste, Colgate 2 in 1 toothpaste and mouthwash and the Colgate Motion battery-powered toothbrush contributed to increased volume and market share. The Personal Care category experienced incremental market share driven by volume gains from recently introduced products such as Softsoap Aromatherapy body wash and liquid hand soap, Irish Spring Vitamins deodorant bar soap and Mennen Speed Stick Power of Nature deodorant. The Household Surface Care category had increased volumes from products such as Palmolive Aromatherapy hand dishwashing liquid. In 2001, North America achieved overall sales growth of 4.0% to $2,299.9 on volume growth of 4.5%. Operating profit in North America grew 12% to $578.7 as a result of volume gains, emphasis on higher margin products, and cost-savings initiatives improving gross profit margin. The impact of the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in 2002 was largely offset by increased pension and benefit costs. Operating profit in 2001 increased 6% to $516.6, reflecting volume growth and efficiencies in advertising spending. 9 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Latin America Net sales in Latin America declined 5.5%, excluding divestitures, to $2,206.8 on 2.5% volume growth offset by the negative effect of foreign currency primarily in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. The strongest volume gains in the region were achieved in Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. Recently launched products including Colgate Fresh Confidence Xtreme Red Gel, Colgate Total Plus Whitening, Colgate Triple Action, Sorriso Jua + Propolis toothpastes, and Colgate Premier Ultra and Colgate Active Flexible manual toothbrushes contributed to increased volume and market share in the Oral Care category throughout the region. Other products contributing to volume gains in the region were Palmolive Naturals bar soaps, Palmolive Naturals and Caprice hair care lines, Mennen Speed Stick Power of Nature deodorant and Fabuloso Vibrante Naturaleza liquid cleaners in the Personal and Household Surface Care categories. In 2001, Latin America net sales declined 2.0% to $2,356.0 as volume gains of 5.0% were negatively impacted by foreign exchange. Operating profit in Latin America decreased 2% to $647.4 as the negative effect of foreign currency offset volume growth, cost-control initiatives, and the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in 2002. Operating profit in 2001 increased 11% to $663.2 as a result of volume gains, higher gross profit margins, ongoing cost containment and efficiencies in advertising spending. Europe Net sales in Europe increased 8.0% to $1,984.3 on unit volume gains of 5.0% and the impact of the stronger Euro. The United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, France and Greece achieved the strongest volume increases in the region. New products including Colgate Total Plus Whitening toothpaste and Colgate 2 in 1 toothpaste and mouthwash contributed to regional volume growth in the Oral Care category. In the Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care categories, new products such as Palmolive Aromatherapy shower gel, foam bath and liquid hand soap, Palmolive Soft & Gentle deodorant, Soupline Lily of the Valley fabric conditioner and Ajax Wipes contributed to increased volumes and market share. In 2001, Europe net sales increased 1.0%, excluding divestitures, to $1,835.0, on volume growth of 5.5%, partially offset by the weakened Euro. Operating profit in Europe increased 19% to $409.0 as a result of volume growth, gross margin improvement, the impact of the stronger Euro, and the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. Operating profit in 2001 increased 7%, excluding divestitures, to $342.6 due to volume gains and higher gross profit margins. Asia/Africa Net sales in Asia/Africa increased 4.0% to $1,542.0 on volume gains of 4.5% offset by the impact of foreign currencies. The Philippines, China, South Africa and Australia achieved the strongest volume gains in the region. New products including Colgate Herbal and Colgate Triple Action toothpastes, and Colgate Active Flexible and Colgate Extra Clean manual toothbrushes contributed to volume gains in the Oral Care category. In the Personal and Household Surface Care categories, recently introduced products such as Protex Herbal antibacterial bar soap and talc, Palmolive Naturals shampoo and Ajax Fêtes des Fleurs liquid cleaner helped to drive volume growth in the region. In 2001, net sales in Asia/Africa declined 1.0% to $1,484.3 as volume gains of 6.0% were offset by foreign currency weakness. Operating profit grew 19% in Asia/Africa to $232.6 in 2002 and 1% to $195.9 in 2001, driven by volume gains and higher gross profit margins benefiting from regionalization of manufacturing facilities. Pet Nutrition Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 7.0% to $1,187.1 on 5.5% volume growth. North American sales increased due to the introduction of innovative new products including Science Diet Nature’s Best, a line of 10 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) natural cat and dog food. Hill’s also experienced strong volume growth in Europe, South Pacific and Asia driven by new products such as Prescription Diet Canine b/d, a clinically proven product that reduces the signs of canine brain aging. In 2001, net sales for the Pet Nutrition segment increased 4.5% to $1,109.1 on 5.5% volume gains. Operating profit in Pet Nutrition grew 13% to $318.3 in 2002 and 16% to $282.1 in 2001 as a result of strong volume gains and higher gross profit margins, as well as ongoing cost-savings initiatives. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operations increased 7% to $1,611.2 compared with $1,503.9 in 2001 and $1,536.2 in 2000. The increase reflects the Company’s improved profitability and working capital management partially offset by higher cash taxes, a portion of which related to a deferral of 2001 taxes into 2002 under a government relief program as a result of the events of September 11, 2001. The decrease in 2001 reflected voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans and higher cash taxes. Cash taxes in 2000 were reduced by certain tax credits that have been fully utilized. Cash generated from operations was used to fund capital spending, pay increased dividends and repurchase common shares. Voluntary contributions to benefit plans made in 2001 were reclassified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from investing activities to operating activities consistent with current year presentation. Capital expenditures were 4% of net sales for 2002, 2001 and 2000. Capital spending continues to be focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2003 are expected to continue at the current rate of approximately 4% of net sales. In 2000, other investing activities included acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $64.9. There were no significant acquisitions in 2002 or 2001. Certain detergent product lines in Central America were sold in 2001 and the Mexico Viva detergent brand was sold in 2000. The aggregate sale price of all 2001 and 2000 sales of brands was $12.5 and $102.5, respectively. There were no significant divestitures in 2002. During 2002, long-term debt increased to $3,509.3 from $3,137.5 and total debt increased to $3,603.9 from $3,239.1, primarily due to continued share repurchases and the impact of translating debt denominated in Euros. The Company’s long-term debt rating was upgraded in 2001 to AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s. Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $391.4 and $605.8, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor’s rating of A1+ and a Moody’s rating of P1. The commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable are classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2002, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. Certain of the Company’s financing arrangements require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to debt. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain amounts payable to banks contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. In 1993, the Company formed a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors that purchases some of the Company’s receivables. The Company consolidates this entity, including such receivables, and reports the amounts invested by outside investors as a minority interest. The purpose of this arrangement is to provide the Company access to low-cost sources of capital. During 2000, this subsidiary ceased operations resulting in a cash payment of $113.9 to the outside investors. In 2001, the subsidiary resumed operations with funding of $89.7 from outside investors. The Company repurchases common shares in the open-market and in private transactions for employee benefit plans and to maintain its targeted capital structure. Aggregate repurchases for 2002 were 20.0 million 11 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) shares, with a total purchase price of $1,082.9. In 2001 and 2000, 21.7 million and 19.1 million shares were repurchased, respectively, with total purchase prices of $1,230.2 and $1,040.6, respectively. Dividend payments were $413.4, up from $396.7 in 2001 and $382.4 in 2000. Common stock dividend payments increased to $.72 per share in 2002 from $.68 per share in 2001 and $.63 per share in 2000. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments were increased to $5.76 per share in 2002 from $5.40 per share in 2001 and $5.04 in 2000. The Company recently increased the annualized common stock dividend to $.96 per share and the annualized Series B Preference Stock dividend to $7.68 per share effective in the second quarter of 2003. Internally generated cash flows are adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures. Free cash flow (defined as cash generated by the business after capital expenditures and dividend payments but before acquisitions, divestitures and share repurchases) was $854.1, $767.0 and $787.2 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and provides the Company with flexibility for further investments and/or financing. The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide. At December 31, 2002, the Company had access to unused lines of credit of $2,082.6 and also had $586.8 available under medium-term notes. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Payments Due by Period Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion $ 3,459.1 $ 1,109.1 (1) $ 308.2 $ 400.4 $ 266.3 $ 247.7 $ 1,127.4 Capitalized leases 50.2 4.9 5.1 5.4 5.6 5.8 23.4 Operating leases 387.6 72.3 62.7 55.8 49.7 48.8 98.3 Unconditional purchaseobligations 108.2 71.5 35.5 1.2 — — — Total $ 4,005.1 $ 1,257.8 $ 411.5 $ 462.8 $ 321.6 $ 302.3 $ 1,249.1 (1) Long-term debt due in 2003 includes $815.5 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2002, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis under its unused lines of credit which expire in 2007. The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. The valuations of financial instruments that are marked to market are based upon independent third-party sources including quoted market prices. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is party to various superfund and other environmental matters in connection with prior acquisitions. Substantially all of these liabilities have been acknowledged in writing as being covered by investment-grade insurance carriers that are presently making all their required payments directly to the cleanup efforts and are expected to do so in the future. The Company is also contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. It is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows of the Company. 12 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Restructuring Reserves In December 2000, the Company recorded a charge of $63.9 ($42.5 aftertax) associated with the realignment of three manufacturing locations in Latin America and the exiting of its business in Nigeria. The charge recorded included $14.2 for termination costs and $49.7 for exiting of manufacturing operations. The restructuring was completed in 2001. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a consolidated basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. With operations in over 200 countries and territories, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the European Union and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. Dollar. The Company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost-containment measures, foreign currency hedging activities and selling price increases. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. The results of the Company’s commodity hedging activities are not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long-term debt rating of A or higher. Value at Risk The Company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. The models utilize a variance/covariance modeling technique. 13 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2002 and 2001. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Company’s results of operations in 2002 and 2001. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and a description of financial instrument activities, refer to Note 2 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-14, “Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives,” and Issue No. 00-25, “Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products,” that relate to the classification of various types of sales incentives and promotional expenses. The Consolidated Statements of Income for 2001 and 2000 have been revised to reflect the reclassification of certain sales incentives and promotional expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to a reduction of net sales and cost of sales; however, the revisions had no impact on the Company’s financial position, net income or earnings per share. These reclassifications reduced net sales by $343.5 and $353.5 and cost of sales by $2.0 and $8.5 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, with an offsetting reduction in each period in selling, general and administrative expenses. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets but requires annual impairment reviews. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, prior period amounts were not restated. A reconciliation of previously reported net income, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for 2001 and 2000 to the amounts adjusted to exclude goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets amortization is presented in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options, shipping and handling costs, and inventories. 14 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) • Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2002 would decrease approximately 3%. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) • Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. If such costs were included in cost of sales, gross margin as a percent to sales would decrease from 54.6% to 47.6% in 2002 with no impact on reported earnings. • The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would be no impact on reported earnings for 2002, 2001 and 2000 if all inventories were accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. • In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for domestic plans was 6.75%, 7.25% and 7.75% as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As required, the discount rate is based upon published year-end rates on high-quality bonds. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was 8.0%, 9.0% and 9.25% as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This assumption is based on historical experience and long-term expectations of asset performance. A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed return on plan assets would impact net income by approximately $6. A third less significant assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which, would partially offset the impact of a change in either of the above rates. • The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. In 2002, the assumed rate was 9% for 2003 and declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by approximately $1.5. • Asset impairment analysis is primarily performed for intangible assets and requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge. • Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. A significant change to the Company’s valuation allowances will not materially impact reported earnings. • Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. It is management’s opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.) 15 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Outlook Looking forward into 2003, the Company is well positioned for continued growth in most of its markets. However, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration. In addition, movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. Dollars. In particular, economic uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of the Euro may impact the overall results of Latin America and Europe. The Company expects the continued success of Colgate toothpaste, using patented and proprietary technology, to bolster worldwide Oral Care leadership and expects new products in Oral Care and other categories to add potential for further growth. Overall, subject to global economic conditions, the Company does not expect the 2003 market conditions to be materially different from those experienced in 2002 and the Company expects its positive momentum to continue. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Therefore, the Company constantly evaluates projects that will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced growth potential. Over the long term, Colgate’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder value. Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements In this report and from time to time, the Company may make statements that constitute or contain “forward-looking” information as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, earnings growth, financial goals, cost-reduction plans and new product introductions among other matters. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements made by the Company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. The following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements: 1. Global Economic Conditions. The Company operates on a global basis, with approximately 70% of its net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. The Company is subject to the full range of economic risks, including those associated with international operations, such as economic recession, inflation, access to capital markets and related costs, movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates, return on pension assets, trade restrictions, tax law changes, political and legal instability, the imposition of trade restrictions and similar factors beyond the control of the Company. 2. Competition. The Company faces vigorous competition from multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same or greater resources than the Company. Such competition is based on pricing of products, promotional activities, advertising, new product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors, the timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the Company. The Company’s ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands, its ability to attract and retain key talent, and its ability to protect its patent, trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors. 3. Retail Trade. The Company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, electronic data transmission requirements and other conditions. With the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation, especially in developed markets such as the U.S. and Europe, the Company is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and these retailers have increasingly greater bargaining strength. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are becoming a source of competition for certain product lines of the Company. 16 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 4. Products. The Company’s growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors, as well as the continued success of existing products. In addition, the Company’s ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological innovations, to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and regulatory approvals, and to anticipate successfully consumer needs and preferences. 5. Cost Pressures. The Company’s ability to manage its cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in raw material prices and by unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, the Company’s move to global suppliers, to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business, has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. 6. Manufacturing. As a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality and safety issues, natural disasters and other external factors over which the Company has no control.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK See “Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure” and “Value at Risk” located on page 13 of this report.",2023-12-30 21:02:12.763572
21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview and Outlook Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth, gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s corporate governance practices (including the Company’s Code of Conduct) help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. 15 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in emerging markets where economic development is likely to expand the markets for the Company’s products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. The Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace and looking forward, expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. As disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, with approximately 75% of its Net sales generated outside of the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. Venezuela has been designated hyper-inflationary effective January 1, 2010. Consequently, the functional currency for the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary will be the U.S. dollar and the impact of all future Venezuelan currency fluctuations will be recorded in income. See “Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure—Foreign Exchange Risk” below and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, on January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced its decision to devalue its currency and implement a two-tier exchange rate structure. As a result, the official exchange rate changed from 2.15 to 2.60 for essential goods and 4.30 for non-essential goods. While we currently believe that many of our products may receive the 2.60 rate of exchange, we will remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan subsidiary for 2010 and future periods at the rate at which we expect to remit dividends, which currently is 4.30. While difficult to project, our preliminary estimate is that the impact of the devaluation will be a net reduction in 2010 diluted earnings per share of between $0.06 and $0.10 per share. This includes the ongoing negative impact from foreign exchange translation, partially offset by one-time benefits from lower taxes on accrued but unpaid remittances and the remeasurement of the local balance sheet at the devaluation date. As actual results may differ, please see “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements” below. The Venezuelan government continues to impose currency exchange controls. We could be negatively affected if we are unable to obtain U.S. dollars at either of the official rates, in which case we may have to obtain dollars through transactions on the parallel market, where the exchange rate is less favorable. In 2009, our Venezuelan operations contributed 6% of consolidated net sales. Lower commodity and oil prices as compared with 2008 had a favorable impact on the Company’s results for 2009. The Company believes that this effect should continue in 2010 and, coupled with ongoing aggressive savings programs and favorable currency trends, should offset the impact of any pressures on selling prices or the costs of any consumption building programs that may be implemented to drive volume given the uncertain economic environment. However, continued difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s suppliers, customers and consumers which could, in turn, have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. 16 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) As a result of the Company’s four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program), which was finalized as of December 31, 2008, the Company streamlined its global supply chain, reallocated resources to enhance its sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing countries and other key markets and consolidated these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Company’s other ongoing cost-savings and growth initiatives, are providing funds for investment in support of key categories and markets and new product development, while also supporting an increased level of profitability. The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s strategic initiatives: getting closer to the consumer, the profession and customers; effectiveness and efficiency in everything; innovation everywhere; and leadership. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brand names and its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long-term. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide Net sales were $15,327 in 2009, level with 2008 as volume growth of 0.5% and net selling price increases of 6.0% were offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 6.5%. Worldwide organic sales (Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) grew 6.5% in 2009. Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $13,195 in 2009, level with 2008, as volume growth of 2.0% and net selling price increases of 5.5% were offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 7.5%. The 2008 divestment of a non-core brand in Germany impacted sales growth in 2009 by 0.5% versus 2008. Excluding the impact of this divestment, Net sales increased 0.5% in 2009 on volume growth of 2.5%. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment grew 8.0% in 2009. Net sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition were $2,132 in 2009, down 0.5% from 2008 as net selling price increases of 8.5% were more than offset by 7.5% volume declines and a 1.5% negative impact of foreign exchange. Organic sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition grew 1.0% in 2009. Worldwide Net sales were $15,330 in 2008, up 11.0% from 2007, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 5.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.0%. The 2007 divestment of the Latin American household bleach business and the 2008 divestment of the Senegal fabric care business reduced sales growth for 2008 by 0.5% versus 2007. Excluding the impact of these divestments, Net sales increased 11.5% in 2008 on volume growth of 4.0%. Worldwide organic sales grew 9.5% in 2008. 17 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Gross Profit Worldwide gross profit margin was 58.8% in 2009, 56.3% in 2008 and 56.2% in 2007. Restructuring and implementation-related charges incurred under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $59 and $154, respectively. The 2004 Restructuring Program lowered the reported gross profit margin by 40 basis points (bps) and 110 bps in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, gross profit margin was 56.7% in 2008 and 57.3% in 2007. The gross profit increase in 2009 was driven by higher pricing and a continued focus on cost-savings programs, partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact and costs related to the remeasurement of liabilities related to inventory purchases in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the decrease in 2008 was due to increases in raw and packaging material costs, partially offset by higher pricing and a continued focus on cost-savings programs. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2009, due to currency exchange control limitations in Venezuela, the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary (CP Venezuela) settled certain of its U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities with dollars obtained through securities transactions in the parallel market at an exchange rate less favorable than the official rate. As a result, in the second half of 2009, CP Venezuela incurred $92 of higher costs related to the remeasurement of U.S. dollar liabilities to be settled with proceeds from these transactions, $65 of which is included in Gross profit for liabilities related to the purchase of inventory and $27 of which is included in Other (income) expense, net for all other liabilities. Additionally, in order to manage its overall currency exposure, CP Venezuela has purchased $210 of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by a Venezuelan state-owned corporation and $50 of U.S. dollar-linked, devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 34.5% in 2009, 35.4% in 2008 and 36.1% in 2007. Included in Selling, general and administrative expenses are charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $81 (0.5% of Net sales) in 2008 and $49 (0.4% of Net sales) in 2007. The 90 bps decrease in 2009 was driven primarily by the absence of charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program in 2009, lower advertising costs (80 bps) and a continued focus on cost-savings programs, partially offset by higher pension and benefit costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales in 2008 decreased by 70 bps due to moderating levels of advertising investment (40 bps) and a continued focus on cost savings programs. 18 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $111, $103 and $54 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In 2008, Operating profit increased 14% from $2,720 in 2007. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program and other items set forth below, Operating profit increased 11% in 2009 and 10% in 2008 as follows: % % 2009 2008 Change 2007 Change Operating profit, GAAP $ 3,615 $ 3,101 17 % $ 2,720 14 % 2004 Restructuring Program — 164 259 Gain on sale of non-core product lines, net — — (49 ) Pension settlement charges — — 15 Hill’s limited voluntary recall — — 14 Operating profit, non-GAAP $ 3,615 $ 3,265 11 % $ 2,959 10 % Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $77 in 2009 compared with $96 in 2008 and $157 in 2007. The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2008 to 2009 was due to lower average interest rates and lower debt levels. The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2007 to 2008 was due to lower average interest rates. 19 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 32.2% in both 2009 and 2008, and 29.6% in 2007. The tax rate in all years benefited from global tax planning strategies. The 2007 effective tax rate reflects a 300 bps reduction from the recognition of $74 of tax benefits as a result of the reduction of a tax loss carryforward valuation allowance in Brazil of $95 that was partially offset by tax provisions for the recapitalization of certain overseas subsidiaries and increases of 40 bps from the impact of the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and 10 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America. The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period depended on the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. The tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2008 and 2007 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 31.4% and 28.9%, respectively. For additional information regarding the Company’s income taxes, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income Net income was $2,291, or $4.37 per share on a diluted basis in 2009 compared with $1,957, or $3.66 per share on a diluted basis in 2008 and $1,737 or $3.20 per share in 2007. Net income in 2008 included $113 ($0.21 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program. Net income in 2007 included a $30 ($0.05 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America and an income tax benefit of $74 ($0.14 per share) related to the tax items noted above, which were more than offset by $184 ($0.34 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, $10 ($0.02 per share) of pension settlement charges and $8 ($0.01 per share) of charges related to the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products. Segment Results The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. To conform to the current year presentation required by the Consolidation Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Codification, the amounts of Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in less-than-wholly owned subsidiaries of $80 and $67 for years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, which were previously deducted from Greater Asia/Africa Operating profit, have been reclassified to a new line below Operating profit. 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Worldwide Net Sales by Business Segment and Geographic Region 2009 2008 2007 Oral, Personal and Home Care North America $ 2,950 $ 2,852 $ 2,721 Latin America 4,319 4,088 3,489 Europe/South Pacific 3,271 3,582 3,383 Greater Asia/Africa 2,655 2,660 2,338 Total Oral, Personal and Home Care 13,195 13,182 11,931 Pet Nutrition 2,132 2,148 1,859 Total Net sales $ 15,327 $ 15,330 $ 13,790 Worldwide Operating Profit by Business Segment and Geographic Region 2009 2008 2007 Oral, Personal and Home Care North America $ 843 $ 689 $ 667 Latin America 1,360 1,181 1,006 Europe/South Pacific 748 746 764 Greater Asia/Africa 631 527 430 Total Oral, Personal and Home Care 3,582 3,143 2,867 Pet Nutrition 555 542 487 Corporate (522 ) (584 ) (634 ) Total Operating profit $ 3,615 $ 3,101 $ 2,720 North America Net sales in North America increased 3.5% in 2009 to $2,950 as a result of 4.0% volume growth and level selling prices, partially offset by a 0.5% negative impact of foreign exchange.

Europe/South Pacific Net sales in Europe/South Pacific decreased 8.5% in 2009 to $3,271 as net selling price increases of 0.5% were more than offset by 0.5% in volume declines and an 8.5% negative impact of foreign exchange. The 2008 divestment of a non-core brand in Germany impacted sales growth for 2009 by 0.5% versus 2008. Excluding the impact of this divestment, Net sales decreased 8.0% in 2009 and volume was level with 2008. Organic sales in Europe/South Pacific grew 0.5% in 2009.

In 2008, Operating profit in Europe/South Pacific decreased 2% to $746, reflecting higher raw and packaging material costs, as well as higher selling, general and administrative costs, partially due to increased advertising spending. 22 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Greater Asia/Africa Net sales in Greater Asia/Africa were level in 2009 at $2,655 as volume growth of 2.0% and net selling prices of 6.0% were offset by a 8.0% negative impact of foreign exchange. Organic sales in Greater Asia/Africa grew 8.0% in 2009. Volume gains were led by India, the Greater China region, Turkey and Thailand. Products driving oral care growth included Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief, Colgate Total Professional Clean and Colgate 360° Whole Mouth Clean toothpastes, Colgate 360° ActiFlex and Colgate Max White manual toothbrushes and Colgate Plax Ice and Colgate Plax Complete Care mouthwashes.

Hill’s Pet Nutrition Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition decreased 0.5% in 2009 to $2,132 as 8.5% net selling price increases were more than offset by 7.5% volume declines and a 1.5% negative impact of foreign exchange. Volume was negatively impacted in part due to price increases taken in late 2008 and early 2009 in response to significantly higher commodity costs. Organic sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition grew 1.0% in 2009. New products contributing to sales in the U.S. specialty channel include a significantly expanded line of Science Diet Simple Essentials Treats Canine.

Organic sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition grew 13.0% in 2008. Operating profit for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 2% to $555 in 2009 due to higher pricing, lower raw and packaging material costs and cost-saving initiatives. In 2008, the Operating profit increased 11% to $542 due to increased sales partially offset by higher agricultural commodities costs and higher advertising spending. Like most major North American pet food producers, Hill’s Pet Nutrition was affected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s pet food recall in March 2007. Hill’s took the precaution of conducting a voluntary recall of a small number of its products that may have been affected. These products accounted for less than 0.5% of Hill’s Pet Nutrition’s annual Net sales. The related sales loss did not have a significant impact on the Company’s 2007 annual Net sales or Operating profit. Hill’s Pet Nutrition’s Operating profit for 2007 does not reflect the impact of the recall as these costs have been included in the Corporate segment. 23 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Corporate Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($522), ($584) and ($634) in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Corporate operations include Corporate overhead costs, research and development costs, stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock awards, restructuring and related implementation costs, gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets, and, in 2007, certain pension settlement charges as well as the impact on Operating profit of the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products.

Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2008 decreased as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, partially offset by higher charges for legal and environmental costs and investment losses. In addition, 2007 includes the negative impact of pension settlement charges and the negative impact of the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Net sales and volume growth, both worldwide and in relevant geographic divisions, are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors as they allow comparisons of Net sales and volume growth from ongoing operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. Worldwide Gross profit margin and Operating profit are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program and other items (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the Company’s ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. 24 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges 2004 Restructuring Program The Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses was finalized as of December 31, 2008 and there were no charges incurred in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. The restructuring accrual decreased from $33 at December 31, 2008 to $15 at December 31, 2009, primarily due to cash payments for termination benefits, exit activities and the implementation of strategies. Charges incurred in connection with the implementation of various projects since inception were as follows: Cumulative Charges as of December 31, 2008 Termination Benefits $ 426 Incremental Depreciation 222 Asset Impairments 47 Other 374 Total cumulative 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 1,069 Other charges primarily consisted of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program. These charges included ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing facilities, start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred $46 of charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities and $137 of costs for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. Total charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program were as follows: North America (36%), Europe/South Pacific (28%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (10%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (21%). 25 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, restructuring and implementation-related charges were reflected in the income statement as follows: 2008 2007 Cost of sales $ 59 $ 154 Selling, general and administrative expenses 81 49 Other (income) expense, net 24 56 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 164 $ 259 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, aftertax $ 113 $ 184 Restructuring and implementation-related charges in the preceding table were recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions were centrally directed and controlled and were not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and implementation-related charges discussed above and the related accrual balances: Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation Asset Impairments Other Total Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 53 $ — $ — $ 12 $ 65 Charges 81 41 — 137 259 Cash payments (65 ) — — (138 ) (203 ) Charges against assets (14 ) (41 ) — (5 ) (60 ) Other (2 ) — — 3 1 Foreign exchange 2 — — — 2 Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 55 $ — $ — $ 9 $ 64 Charges 33 20 (12 ) 123 164 Cash payments (74 ) — — (121 ) (195 ) Charges against assets (3 ) (20 ) 12 21 10 Other — — — (7 ) (7 ) Foreign exchange 1 — — (4 ) (3 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 12 $ — $ — $ 21 $ 33 Charges — — — — — Cash payments (7 ) — — (11 ) (18 ) Charges against assets — — — — — Other — — — — — Foreign exchange (1 ) — — 1 — Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 4 $ — $ — $ 11 $ 15 Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program were calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits also include pension enhancements amounting to $3 in 2008, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Termination benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension liabilities. 26 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that are taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Within Asset impairments, charges are net of gains realized on the sale of assets. During 2008, Other charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities were $5 and costs incurred for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were $66. Start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were expensed as incurred. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including debt service, dividends, capital expenditures and planned stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash-generating capability and financial condition should continue to allow it broad access to financial markets worldwide. Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations in 2009 was $3,277 as compared with $2,302 in 2008 and $2,252 in 2007. The increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily related to improved profitability, decreased working capital and lower cash spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, partially offset by higher tax payments. The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 reflects the Company’s improved profitability, offset by increased working capital, higher tax payments and higher voluntary cash contributions to the Company’s U.S. postretirement benefit plans. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Overall, the Company’s working capital decreased to (0.4%) of Net sales in 2009 as compared with 2.5% in 2008. The decrease in working capital in 2009 is primarily related to improved accounts receivable days’ sales outstanding and decreased inventory days outstanding, while current liabilities including income taxes increased with our profitability. In 2008, higher balances in accounts receivable were due primarily to higher Net sales. Additionally, inventory and accounts payable and other accruals increased in 2008 as a result of raw material cost increases and inventory build-up for new product launches and promotional activities. Investing activities used $841 of cash during 2009 compared with uses of $613 and $528 during 2008 and 2007, respectively. Investing activities for 2009 included the purchase of $210 of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by a Venezuelan state-owned corporation and $50 of U.S. dollar-linked, devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. The increase in use in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to higher capital spending and lower proceeds from the sale of property and non-core product lines, offset by lower payments for acquisitions. 27 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Capital expenditures were $575, $684 and $583 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Lower capital expenditures in 2009 reflected the completion during the year of certain capacity expansions, as well as the completion of the 2004 Restructuring Program at the end of 2008. Capital spending continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2010 are expected to represent approximately 3.5% of Net sales. Investing activities in 2009 and 2008 included $17 and $58, respectively, of proceeds from the sale of certain assets, including certain asset sales in 2008 related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Investing activities in 2007 included $67 of net proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Latin American household bleach business and $43 of proceeds from the sale of other property related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. In 2007, the Company increased its ownership interest in one of its subsidiaries in China to 100% at a cost of $27. Financing activities used $2,270 of cash during 2009 compared to $1,530 and $1,803 during 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in 2009 was primarily due to higher net debt payments and an increase in dividends paid. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock. Long-term debt decreased to $3,147 as of December 31, 2009 as compared to $3,676 as of December 31, 2008 and total debt decreased to $3,182 as of December 31, 2009 as compared to $3,783 as of December 31, 2008. The Company’s long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. At December 31, 2009, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,014 and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In August 2008, the Company increased the borrowing capacity under its domestic revolving credit facility from $1,500 to $1,600 by adding two banks to the syndicate of banks participating in the revolving credit facility. The facility has an expiration date of November 2012. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support the issuance of commercial paper. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company issued $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated six-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.15% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were primarily used to reduce commercial paper borrowings. In addition, during the third quarter of 2009, to effectively convert a portion of the Company’s fixed rate debt portfolio to a variable rate, the Company also entered into interest rate swaps, with a total notional value of $330. During 2008, the Company issued $250 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 4.2% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. The Company simultaneously entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of the notes to a variable rate. During 2008, the Company also issued approximately $75 of forty-year notes at a variable rate, also under the shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay $100 of medium-term notes with an original maturity of May 2017 and to reduce commercial paper borrowings. During 2007, the Company issued 250 million of Euro-denominated medium-term notes maturing in June 2014 at a fixed interest rate of 4.75%, payable annually. The net proceeds of approximately $332 (248 million Euros) from the issuance were used to pay down U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper. 28 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $0 and $735 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2009 and 2008 were $1,144 and $1,284, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor’s rating of A-1+ and a Moody’s Investors Service rating of P-1. The Company regularly classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt as it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in 2012. Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities. Dividend payments in 2009 were $981, an increase from $889 in 2008 and $798 in 2007. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.72 per share in 2009 from $1.56 per share in 2008 and $1.40 per share in 2007. The Series B Preference stock dividend payments increased to $13.76 per share in 2009 from $12.48 per share in 2008 and $11.20 per share in 2007. On February 4, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.53 per share, effective as of the second quarter 2010. The Effect of exchange rate changes on Cash and cash equivalents in 2009 primarily reflects the premium associated with acquiring U.S. dollar currency through parallel market transactions in Venezuela. The Company repurchases its shares of common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. The repurchases are made pursuant to programs authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. Shares repurchased from January 30, 2008 through February 4, 2010 were repurchased pursuant to a program authorized by the Board on January 30, 2008 (the 2008 Program) and shares repurchased from March 9, 2006 to January 29, 2008 were repurchased pursuant to a program authorized by the Board on March 9, 2006 (the 2006 Program). On February 4, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2010 Program) which replaced the 2008 Program. The 2010 Program authorizes the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Aggregate repurchases in 2009 included 13.9 million common shares under the 2008 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,063. Aggregate repurchases in 2008 included 13.8 million common shares under both the 2008 Program and the 2006 Program, and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,073. Aggregate repurchases in 2007 included 20.8 million common shares for a total purchase price of $1,269. 29 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion $ 3,147 $ 326 $ 639 $ 341 $ 262 $ 358 $ 1,221 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(1) 686 110 98 87 68 58 265 Leases 1,283 185 158 140 121 109 570 Purchase obligations(2) 551 287 140 77 25 11 11 Total(3) $ 5,667 $ 908 $ 1,035 $ 645 $ 476 $ 536 $ 2,067 ____________ (1) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. (2) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2009 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. (3) Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates,” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2012. Management’s best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Company’s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2010, is approximately $120, including approximately $35 for other retiree benefit plans. These estimated cash requirements include approximately $55 of projected contributions to the Company’s postretirement plans, comprised of $35 of voluntary contributions to our U.S. pension plans and approximately $20 of projected benefit payments made directly to participants of unfunded plans. Liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. 30 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives for any purpose as well as derivatives for trading purposes. The sensitivity of our financial instruments to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements. Foreign Exchange Risk As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign currency exposures reflect the Company’s operations in the markets in Latin America (28% of Net sales), Europe/South Pacific (21% of Net sales) and Asia/Africa (17% of Net sales). The Company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each segment. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories, prepaids, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income. The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable forward rates. 31 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Our foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $4 at December 31, 2009 and net unrealized losses of $5 at December 31, 2008. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2009, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $17. Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates. Based on year-end 2009 variable rate debt levels, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased Interest expense, net by $10 in 2009. Commodity Price Risk The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities. Our open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized losses of $0 and $7 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At the end of 2009, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in an unrealized net loss of $1. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely as it is the Company’s policy to contract with highly rated diverse counterparties. Recent Accounting Pronouncements No new accounting pronouncement issued or which became effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories. • Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 730 bps, from 58.8% to 51.5%, in 2009 and decreased by 780 and 790 bps in 2008 and 2007, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings. • The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (approximately 79% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (approximately 21% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2009, 2008 and 2007 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies. • In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.75%, 6.30% and 6.50% as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The discount rate for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.75%, 5.80% and 6.50% as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return. 33 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 17%, 5%, 4%, 6%, and 9%, respectively. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 33% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term), 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 9.25% in the long-term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans. • The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 9.00% for 2010, declining to 5.00% by 2016 and remaining at 5.00% for the years thereafter. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by $5. • The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $12.06. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 9%. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 5%. • The asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. • The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. • Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. 34 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) • Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies. The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies. Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, profit and profit margin growth, earnings growth, financial goals, the impact of the recent currency devaluation in Venezuela, cost-reduction plans, tax rates and new product introductions, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to us and the markets we serve, including currency rate fluctuations, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, our ability to maintain or increase selling prices as required, changes in the policies of retail trade customers and our ability to continue lowering costs and to mitigate the impact of the recent currency devaluation in Venezuela. For information about these and other factors that could impact our business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview and Outlook Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through specialty pet retailers and the veterinary profession. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, and the Company’s corporate governance practices (including the Company’s Code of Conduct), help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. As disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, with approximately 75% of its Net sales generated outside of the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In particular, as a result of the devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte, described more fully in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the local currency operations of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary (CP Venezuela) now translate into fewer U.S. dollars, which had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company’s reported results. The Company has taken, and continues to take, actions to mitigate the impact of both devaluations on its operations. Additionally, the Venezuelan government continues to impose currency exchange controls and during 2010 a new currency market was established which replaced the free-floating parallel market. Although CP Venezuela continues to have limited access to U.S. dollars at the official rate and currently only for imported goods, under the current restrictions, it is not permitted to access the new currency market. The Company’s business in Venezuela and our ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional currency exchange controls. For the year ended December 31, 2010, CP Venezuela represented 4% of the Company’s consolidated Net sales. At December 31, 2010, CP Venezuela’s monetary local currency net asset position was approximately $200. Looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, the Company has recently experienced heightened competitive activity in certain markets from other large multinational companies, some of which may have greater resources than we do. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending. Additionally, we have experienced a sharp rise in commodity costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to address the heightened competitive activity and increased commodity costs, should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results. The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s strategic initiatives: getting closer to the consumer, the profession and customers; effectiveness and efficiency in everything; innovation everywhere; and leadership. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brand names and its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long-term. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide Net sales were $15,564 in 2010, up 1.5% from 2009 as volume growth of 3.0% and level selling prices were partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 1.5%. Worldwide organic sales (Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) grew 3.0% in 2010. Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $13,484 in 2010, up 2.0% from 2009, as volume growth of 4.0% and level selling prices were partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 2.0%. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment grew 4.0% in 2010. Net sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition were $2,080 in 2010, down 2.5% from 2009 as 2.0% volume declines and net selling price decreases of 1.5% were partially offset by a 1.0% positive impact of foreign exchange. Organic sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition decreased 3.5% in 2010. Worldwide Net sales were $15,327 in 2009, level with 2008 as volume growth of 0.5% and net selling price increases of 6.0% were offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 6.5%. Worldwide organic sales grew 6.5% in 2009. 15 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Gross Profit Worldwide gross profit margin was 59.1% in 2010, 58.8% in 2009 and 56.3% in 2008. The gross profit margin increase in 2010 was due to a continued focus on cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by rising commodity costs and negative foreign exchange. The gross profit margin increase in 2009 was driven by higher pricing, a continued focus on cost-saving initiatives, and the absence of charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact and costs related to the remeasurement of liabilities related to inventory purchases in Venezuela. During 2008, restructuring and implementation-related charges incurred under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales were $59. The 2004 Restructuring Program lowered the reported gross profit margin by 40 bps in 2008. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, gross profit margin was 56.7% in 2008. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 34.8% in 2010, 34.5% in 2009 and 35.4% in 2008. The 30 bps increase in 2010 was primarily due to higher advertising spending (60 bps), partially offset by the impact of cost-saving initiatives. The 90 bps decrease in 2009 was driven primarily by the absence of charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program in 2009, lower advertising spending (80 bps) and a continued focus on cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by higher pension and benefit costs. In 2008, Selling, general and administrative expenses included $81 (0.5% of Net sales) of charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $301, $111 and $103 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In 2009, Operating profit increased 17% from $3,101 in 2008. Excluding the impact of the one-time charge related to the transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela, the 2004 Restructuring Program and other items set forth below, Operating profit increased 5% in 2010 and 11% in 2009 as follows: % % 2010 2009 Change 2008 Change Operating profit, GAAP $ 3,489 $ 3,615 (3% ) $ 3,101 17% Venezuela hyperinflationary transition charge 271 — — Termination benefits 86 — — Gain on sales of non-core product lines (50 ) — — 2004 Restructuring Program — — 164 Operating profit, non-GAAP $ 3,796 $ 3,615 5% $ 3,265 11% Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $59 in 2010 compared with $77 in 2009 and $96 in 2008. The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2009 to 2010 was due to lower average interest rates. The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2008 to 2009 was due to lower average interest rates and lower debt levels. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 32.6% in 2010 and 32.2% in both 2009 and 2008 and all years benefited from global tax strategies. The impact on the Company’s effective income tax rate of the one-time charge related to the transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela and other items in 2010 was as follows: Effective income tax rate, as reported 32.6 % Transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela (2.4 ) Termination benefits (0.1 ) Sales of non-core product lines (0.1 ) Remeasurement of Venezuelan balance sheet and lower taxes on unpaid remittances 1.5 Reorganization of an overseas subsidiary 0.8 Effective income tax rate, Non-GAAP 32.3 % Net Income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company was $2,203, or $4.31 per share on a diluted basis in 2010 compared with $2,291, or $4.37 per share on a diluted basis in 2009 and $1,957 or $3.66 per share in 2008.

Organic sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition declined 3.5% in 2010. Volume declined in the U.S., Russia, Japan, the Nordic countries, France and Germany, while volume gains were achieved in Australia and South Africa. Volume was negatively impacted as a result of heightened competitive activity and in part due to residual effects of price increases taken in late 2008 and early 2009 in response to significantly higher commodity costs. The Company has taken steps to adjust on-shelf product pricing and sizing and this, combined with the introduction of innovative new products, has resulted in increased unit consumption towards the end of 2010 as compared to the prior year. Successful new products within the U.S. included Science Diet Small and Toy Breed Canine, Science Diet Healthy Mobility Canine, Science Diet Weight Loss System and Prescription Diet Therapeutic Weight Reduction Program. Successful products contributing to international sales included Science Diet Small and Toy Breed Canine, Science Diet Senior Advanced Canine and Feline, Science Plan Sterilized Cat and Science Plan VetEssentials Canine and Feline.

Corporate operations include Corporate overhead costs, research and development costs, stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards, restructuring and related implementation costs and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The components of Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment are presented below: 2010 2009 2008 Venezuela hyperinflationary transition charge $ (271 ) $ — $ — Termination benefits (86 ) — — Gain on sales of non-core product lines 50 — — 2004 Restructuring Program — — (164 ) Corporate overhead costs and other, net (451 ) (522 ) (420 ) Total Corporate Operating profit (loss) $ (758 ) $ (522 ) $ (584 ) 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2010 showed an increased loss as compared to 2009, primarily due to the one-time charge related to the transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela and termination benefits, primarily relating to ongoing overhead reduction initiatives at Hill’s of $48 and in Europe of $29, partially offset by the gain on sales of non-core product lines in Latin America and a decrease in Corporate overhead costs. Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2009 showed a decreased loss as compared to 2008, primarily due to charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program in 2008, offset by higher Corporate overhead costs, primarily pension and benefit costs. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Net sales growth, both worldwide and in relevant geographic divisions, is discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to investors as it allows comparisons of Net sales growth from ongoing operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. Worldwide Gross profit margin, Operating profit and the effective tax rate are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of the one-time charge related to the transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela as of January 1, 2010, the 2004 Restructuring Program and certain other items described above (non-GAAP). Management believes these measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying business trends and performance of the Company’s ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges The Company’s four-year restructuring and business building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses was finalized as of December 31, 2008. There were no charges incurred in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Charges incurred in 2008 amounted to $164. The restructuring accrual decreased from $15 at December 31, 2009 to $8 at December 31, 2010, primarily due to cash payments for termination benefits, exit activities and the implementation of strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including debt service, dividends, capital expenditures and planned stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global capital markets. 21 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations in 2010 was $3,211 as compared with $3,277 in 2009 and $2,302 in 2008. The decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to increased working capital. The increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflects improved profitability, decreased working capital and lower cash spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, partially offset by higher tax payments. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Overall, the Company’s working capital increased to 0.3% of Net sales in 2010 as compared with (0.4%) in 2009. The increase in working capital as a percentage of Net sales in 2010 was due primarily to lower accrued income taxes. Investing activities used $658 of cash during 2010 compared with uses of $841 and $613 during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures were $550, $575 and $684 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Lower capital expenditures in 2010 and 2009 reflected the completion of certain capacity expansions, as well as the completion of the 2004 Restructuring Program at the end of 2008. Capital spending continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to represent approximately 3.5% of Net sales. Net cash outflows from activity related to marketable securities and other investments were lower in 2010 than in 2009. During 2009, the Company purchased $210 of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by a Venezuelan state-owned corporation and $50 of U.S. dollar-linked, devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. During 2010, CP Venezuela sold all of the U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to obtain U.S. dollars in order to support current and future operations and purchased an additional $67 of the U.S. dollar-linked, devaluation-protected bonds to reduce the Company’s exposure to the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte. See Notes 7 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Separately, during 2010, the Company invested $136 in a portfolio of euro-denominated investment grade fixed income securities, including corporate bonds. Financing activities used $2,624 of cash during 2010 compared to $2,270 and $1,530 during 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and dividends paid, partially offset by higher net proceeds from issuances of debt. The increase in 2009 was primarily due to higher net debt payments and an increase in dividends paid. Long-term debt increased to $3,376 as of December 31, 2010 as compared to $3,147 as of December 31, 2009 and total debt increased to $3,424 as of December 31, 2010 as compared to $3,182 as of December 31, 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company issued $250 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.95% and $188 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.375% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company issued $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated six-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.15% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to reduce commercial paper and other borrowings. At December 31, 2010, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,317 and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Company has borrowing capacity under its domestic revolving credit facility of $1,600, and the facility has an expiration date of November 2012. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support the issuance of commercial paper. 22 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $214 and $0 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2010 and 2009 were $1,146 and $1,144, respectively. The maximum daily balance outstanding for commercial paper during 2010 and 2009 was $1,628 and $1,556, respectively. The Company regularly classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt as it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in 2012. Following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Payable to banks 3.1 % 2011 $ 48 0.7 % 2010 $ 35 Commercial paper 0.2 % 2011 214 — — — Total $ 262 $ 35 Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities. Dividend payments in 2010 were $1,142, an increase from $981 in 2009 and $889 in 2008. Common stock dividend payments increased to $2.03 per share in 2010 from $1.72 per share in 2009 and $1.56 per share in 2008. The Series B Preference stock dividend payments increased to $16.24 per share in 2010 from $13.76 per share in 2009 and $12.48 per share in 2008. On February 4, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.53 per share, effective as of the second quarter 2010. The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On February 4, 2010 the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2010 Program) that replaced the Company’s previous share repurchase program which had been approved in 2008 (the 2008 Program). The 2010 Program authorizes the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Aggregate repurchases in 2010 included 24.4 million common shares under both the 2010 Program and the 2008 Program, and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $2,020. Aggregate repurchases in 2009 included 13.9 million common shares under the 2008 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,063. Aggregate repurchases in 2008 included 13.8 million common shares under the 2008 Program and the repurchase program approved by the Board in 2006, and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,073. 23 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion $ 3,376 $ 775 $ 359 $ 268 $ 332 $ 481 $ 1,161 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(1) 539 84 67 63 55 44 226 Leases 1,225 187 163 137 119 111 508 Purchase obligations(2) 523 317 124 45 24 13 — Total $ 5,663 $ 1,363 $ 713 $ 513 $ 530 $ 649 $ 1,895 ____________ (1) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. (2) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2010 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates,” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2012. Management’s best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Company’s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2011, is approximately $208, including approximately $100 of voluntary contributions to our U.S. pension plans. Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. 24 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements. Foreign Exchange Risk As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company’s foreign currency exposures primarily reflect the Company’s operations in Latin America (27% of Net sales), Europe/South Pacific (21% of Net sales) and Asia/Africa (19% of Net sales). The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each segment. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, Venezuela), inventories, prepaids, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company. The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward, option and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized losses of $3 at December 31, 2010 and net unrealized gains of $4 at December 31, 2009. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2010, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $40. 25 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates. Based on year-end 2010 variable rate debt levels, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased Interest expense, net by $14 in 2010. Commodity Price Risk The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tallow, essential oils, tropical oils, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities. The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized gains of $4 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At the end of 2010, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have reduced the net unrealized gain to $2. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely as it is the Company’s policy to contract with highly rated, diverse counterparties. Recent Accounting Pronouncements No new accounting pronouncement issued or which became effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories. 26 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) § Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 730 bps, from 59.1% to 51.8%, in 2010 and decreased by 730 and 780 bps in 2009 and 2008, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings. § The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (79% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (21% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2010, 2009 and 2008 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies. § In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.30%, 5.75% and 6.30% as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The discount rate for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.30%, 5.75% and 5.80% as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return. Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 12%, 5%, 5%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 40% in fixed income securities, 52% in equity securities and 8% in real estate and alternative investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $2. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $7. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans. § The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 8.33% for 2011, declining to 5.00% by 2016 and remaining at 5.00% for the years thereafter. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $5. § The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $11.00. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include the expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7%. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 5%. 27 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) § The asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. § The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. § Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. § Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies. The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies. Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Executive Overview Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver consistent, superior shareholder returns by providing consumers, on a global basis, with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end the Company is tightly focused on two business segments: Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These core businesses and product categories are selected and prioritized according to their capacity to sustain longer term growth, strong global equities and maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies to yield a competitive advantage capable of delivering financial returns above its cost of capital. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each area. As a consequence of this geographic diversity—the Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide—the organization has a geographic balance which limits exposure to external events in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care segment is operated through four operating divisions, North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Africa, which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hill’s also competes on a worldwide basis selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. To achieve its financial objectives, the Company employs a strategy which is used in all businesses worldwide and that focuses the organization on initiatives to both drive growth and simultaneously fund that growth. Growth and therefore revenues are driven by bringing to the marketplace products which offer value to the consumer through new benefits and convenience in the categories where the Company competes. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, corporate-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. In December 2003, the Company announced that it has agreed to acquire GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. Also, consistent with the Company’s strategy to de-emphasize heavy-duty detergents, the Company completed the sale of its European laundry detergent brands during 2003. 7 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company sees material opportunities for growth through its ability to identify and meet new consumer needs within the categories in which it competes. This includes deploying the insights and products developed in one region on a global basis. Growth opportunities are especially evident in those areas where the Company can leverage economic development and where rising consumer disposable incomes expand the markets for its products. The organization is, therefore, actively focused on the development of such products using global and local knowledge and consumer insight and has an organization in place to ensure these learnings and product bundles are introduced expeditiously around the world. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include measurements of market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margins, operating profits and net income; and measures to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. For an additional discussion of key factors and risks that could impact future financial results, refer to the information set forth below under the caption “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements.” Ultimately, these indicators and other procedures for corporate governance (including the Corporate Code of Conduct) are used to ensure that business health is maintained and effective control exercised. The success of these measures is indicated by the vitality of the business and in its financial strength. The resultant strong and consistent cash flow, evidenced by the company’s AA-/(Aa3) credit rating, in turn provides flexibility for future investments and growth. Results of Operations The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care; and Pet Nutrition. Segment performance is evaluated based on several factors, including operating profit. The Company uses operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. 2003 2002 2001(3) Worldwide Net Sales by Business Segment and Geographic Region Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care North America(1) $ 2,356.2 $ 2,374.1 $ 2,299.9 Latin America 2,179.5 2,206.8 2,356.0 Europe 2,304.1 1,984.3 1,835.0 Asia/Africa 1,747.5 1,542.0 1,484.3 Total Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care 8,587.3 8,107.2 7,975.2 Total Pet Nutrition(2) 1,316.1 1,187.1 1,109.1 Net Sales $ 9,903.4 $ 9,294.3 $ 9,084.3 (1) Net sales in the U.S. for Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care were $1,986.9, $2,030.4 and $1,976.7 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. (2) Net sales in the U.S. for Pet Nutrition were $752.8, $714.5 and $661.5 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. (3) Segment information for 2001 has been revised for the following new accounting requirements and certain reclassifications. Net sales were revised for the impact of accounting for sales incentives described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with no effect on operating profit or net income. Amounts for certain businesses in the Caribbean, which were previously reported in Latin America, have been reclassified to North America to conform with current year presentation and the change in management responsibilities that occurred in 2002. 8 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Net Sales Worldwide net sales increased 6.5% to $9,903.4 in 2003 on volume growth of 3.5%, increases in net selling prices of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%. Net sales in the Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care segment increased 6.0% on 3.5% volume growth while net sales in Pet Nutrition increased 11.0% on 4.5% volume growth. In 2002, worldwide net sales, excluding divestitures, increased 2.5% to $9,294.3 on volume growth of 4.5%, offset by the negative impact of foreign currencies. Gross Profit Gross profit margin increased to 55.0%, above both the 2002 level of 54.6% and the 2001 level of 53.4%. This favorable trend reflects the Company’s strategy to improve all aspects of its supply chain through global sourcing, regionalization of manufacturing facilities and other cost-reduction initiatives despite an increase in worldwide materials costs in 2003, as well as its focus on its high margin oral and personal care businesses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 33.3% in 2003, 32.6% in 2002 and 32.1% in 2001. The increase as a percent of sales in 2003 was driven by increases in advertising of 0.6% and pension and other employee benefit costs of 0.4%, partially offset by savings from cost-control initiatives of 0.3%. The 2002 increase was primarily driven by pension and other employee benefit costs that were partially offset by the benefit of ongoing cost-savings initiatives. Total advertising support behind the Company’s brands, including media, promotion and other consumer and trade incentives, some of which reduce reported net sales, has increased by 13%, 8% and 1% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is media spending of $514.0, $486.6 and $509.0 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Increased media spending in 2003 supported new product launches and helped increase market shares throughout the world. The decrease in media spending in 2002 reflected lower media pricing, the negative impact of foreign exchange and a slight shift in investment to other forms of total advertising support. Other (Income) Expense, Net During 2003, Other (income) expense, net changed by $38.0, from $23.0 of expense to ($15.0) of income. The primary components driving this change consist of gains of $107.2 ($63.5 aftertax) related to the sale of non-core brands partially offset by $59.3 ($39.0 aftertax) of costs related to the regionalization of manufacturing facilities, which combined resulted in a net benefit of $47.9 ($24.5 aftertax). The Company sold various detergent brands marketed in France, Italy and Scandinavia and certain non-core soap brands marketed in Europe. In connection with the European brands divestment during 2003 and the Company’s ongoing focus on the regionalization of manufacturing facilities to streamline and strengthen its operations, the Company initiated the realignment of certain manufacturing operations and workforce reduction programs primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia/Africa. For additional information refer to “Restructuring Activities” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2002, Other (income) expense, net decreased from $94.5 to $23.0 reflecting the benefit from the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets and changes in the fair value of foreign currency contracts. These contracts are an economic hedge of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting. 9 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2003 2002 2001 Minority interest $ 45.2 $ 41.3 $ 40.1 Amortization of intangible assets 12.3 12.5 68.0 Equity losses/(income) (.3 ) .6 (.2 ) Gains on sales of non-core product lines, net (107.2 ) — (10.8 ) Restructuring activities 59.3 — — Other, net (24.3 ) (31.4 ) (2.6 ) Total other (income) expense, net $ (15.0 ) $ 23.0 $ 94.5 Other, net consists of miscellaneous gains and losses including gains and losses on interest rate and foreign currency hedge contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Operating Profit Operating profit rose 8% to $2,166.0 in 2003 from $2,013.1 in 2002, which had reflected a 10% increase from 2001 operating profit of $1,834.8. The continued increase resulted from sales growth, cost-saving initiatives as well as the net impact of sales of non-core brands and restructuring activities. If 2001 results were adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, operating profit would have been $1,889.1. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $124.1 in 2003 compared with $142.8 in 2002 and $166.1 in 2001. This decreasing trend is the result of lower interest rates and, in 2003, reduced debt levels. Income Taxes The effective tax rate on income was 30.4% in 2003 versus 31.1% in 2002 and 31.3% in 2001. If 2001 had been adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, the tax rate would have been 30.9%. The effective tax rate was reduced through the realization of tax credits and incentives in all years presented, and as a result of global tax planning strategies including overseas asset revaluations in 2003 and 2001. Net Income Net income was $1,421.3 in 2003 or $2.46 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,288.3 in 2002 or $2.19 per share and $1,146.6 in 2001 or $1.89 per share. As previously discussed, net income in 2003 includes a net aftertax benefit of $24.5 or $.04 per share resulting from the gain on the sale of certain European detergent brands, offset by restructuring activities. If results for 2001 were adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, net income and diluted earnings per share would have been $1,190.4 and $1.96, respectively. 10 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Segment Results 2003 2002 2001(1) Worldwide Operating Profit by Business Segment and Geographic Region Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care North America $ 547.4 $ 578.7 $ 516.6 Latin America 613.3 647.4 663.2 Europe 488.2 409.0 342.6 Asia/Africa 280.7 232.6 195.9 Total Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care 1,929.6 1,867.7 1,718.3 Total Pet Nutrition 371.0 318.3 282.1 Total Corporate (134.6 ) (172.9 ) (165.6 ) Operating Profit $ 2,166.0 $ 2,013.1 $ 1,834.8 (1) As is described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002 to conform to new accounting requirements. In accordance with the new standard, prior periods were not restated. Amounts for certain businesses in the Caribbean, which were previously reported in Latin America, have been reclassified to North America to conform with current year presentation and change in management responsibilities that occurred in 2002. North America Net sales in North America declined 1.0% to $2,356.2 on volume gains of 0.5%, positive foreign exchange of 1.0% and declines in net selling prices of 2.5%. Lower Colgate Simply White at-home tooth whitening gel sales in 2003 were offset by recent introductions such as Colgate Simply White toothpaste, Colgate Total Advanced Fresh toothpaste, Colgate Whitening and Colgate Massager manual toothbrushes, Colgate powered toothbrushes for kids featuring LEGO BIONICLE, and Softsoap Aromatherapy, Softsoap Foamworks and Softsoap Naturals Milk & Honey brand liquid hand soaps, which contributed to volume growth. In 2002, North America achieved overall sales growth of 3.0% to $2,374.1 on volume growth of 6.0%. Operating profit in North America declined 5% to $547.4 due to increased media and promotion costs as well as the decline in sales. Operating profit in 2002 increased 12% to $578.7, as a result of volume gains, emphasis on higher margin products, and cost-savings initiatives improving gross profit margin. The impact of the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in 2002 was largely offset by increased pension and benefit costs. Latin America Net sales in Latin America declined 1.0% to $2,179.5 on 4.0% volume growth and increases in net selling prices of 7.5%, offset by the negative impact of 12.5% resulting from foreign currency declines primarily in Mexico, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and Colombia. The strongest volume gains in the region were achieved in Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Chile. New products contributing to volume growth in Oral Care include Colgate Total Plus Whitening and Sorriso Super Refreshing toothpastes, Colgate Simply White at-home tooth whitening gel, and Colgate Active Angle, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Disney Finding Nemo manual toothbrushes. Driving growth in Personal and Household Surface Care are Palmolive Aromatherapy translucent bar soap, Palmolive Caprice specialty shampoos, and Fabuloso Orange Energy and Ajax Baking Soda and Citrus liquid cleaners. In 2002, Latin America net sales declined 5.5% to $2,206.8 as volume gains of 2.5% were negatively impacted by foreign exchange. 11 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Operating profit in Latin America decreased 5% to $613.3 due to negative foreign currency impact offset by volume growth and cost-control initiatives. These factors, offset by the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles, caused a 2% decrease in operating profit in 2002 to $647.2. Europe Net sales in Europe increased 16.0% to $2,304.1 on volume gains of 3.0% and a 15.5% positive impact of stronger foreign currencies, primarily the euro, offset by a 2.5% decline in net selling prices. The United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Scandinavia achieved the strongest volume increases in the region. New products contributing to growth in Oral Care throughout Europe include Colgate Sensitive and Colgate Triple Action toothpastes, and Colgate Massager, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Whitening manual toothbrushes. Palmolive Aromatherapy Sensual, Palmolive Thermal and Palmolive Thermal Spa shower gels and bath foams, Lady Speed Stick Aloe deodorant, Palmolive Oxygen dishwashing liquid and Soupline Hearts fabric conditioner tablets drove growth in Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care. In 2002, European net sales increased 8.0% to $1,984.3 on volume growth of 5.0%. Operating profit in Europe increased 19% to $488.2 in 2003 and 19% to $409.0 in 2002 as a result of volume growth, gross margin improvement, the impact of the stronger euro and, in 2002, the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. Asia/Africa Net sales in Asia/Africa increased 13.5% to $1,747.5 on volume gains of 7.5% and the positive impact of 8.5% from foreign currencies offset by a 2.5% decrease in net selling prices. China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia achieved the strongest volume gains in the region. Successful new products driving growth in Oral Care are Colgate Herbal and Colgate Herbal White toothpastes, and Colgate Premier Ultra and Colgate Navigator Plus manual toothbrushes. Protex SunCare bar soap, Palmolive Naturals shampoo and Palmolive Aromatherapy shampoo, shower gel, talc, liquid hand soap and translucent bar soap contributed to growth in Personal Care throughout the region. In 2002, net sales in Asia/Africa increased 4.0% to $1,542.0 as volume gains of 4.5% were partially offset by foreign currency weakness. Operating profit grew 21% in Asia/Africa to $280.7 in 2003 and 19% to $232.6 in 2002, driven by volume gains and higher gross profit margins benefiting from the regionalization of manufacturing facilities as well as strong foreign currencies. Pet Nutrition Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 11.0% to $1,316.1 on 4.5% volume growth, an increase of 1.5% in net selling prices and 5.0% in positive foreign currency impact. Hills’ business in the U.S. was driven by the continued success of Science Diet Nature’s Best, Science Diet Advanced Protection and Prescription Diet Feline m/d. Internationally, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, New Zealand, the Philippines and Russia each contributed strong volume gains. The continued rollout of Science Plan and Science Diet Nature’s Best throughout Europe and Asia contributed to the strong international results. In 2002, net sales for the Pet Nutrition segment increased 7.0% to $1,187.1 on 5.5% volume gains. Operating profit in Pet Nutrition grew 17% to $371.0 in 2003 and 13% to $318.3 in 2002 as a result of strong volume gains and higher gross profit margins, as well as ongoing cost-savings initiatives. LEGO™ and BIONICLE™ are trademarks of the LEGO Group used here with special permission. 12 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operations increased 10% to $1,767.7 compared with $1,611.2 in 2002 and $1,503.9 in 2001. The increase reflects the Company’s improved profitability and working capital management including lower cash taxes. A portion of the higher taxes paid in 2002 related to a deferral of 2001 taxes into 2002 under a government relief program as a result of the events of September 11, 2001. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of sales improved to 1.7% of sales as compared with 3.2% of sales in 2002. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The inventory and accounts receivable components of working capital changed slightly from December 31, 2002 as both inventory days coverage and receivable days sales outstanding remained essentially unchanged. Working capital at December 31, 2003 includes an increase of approximately $69.6 of accrued liabilities related to taxes and restructuring costs incurred in connection with the Company’s sale of certain non-core product lines and other associated actions. The majority of these amounts are expected to be paid in the first half of 2004. Cash generated from operations in 2003 was used to fund capital spending, pay dividends, repurchase common stock and reduce overall debt levels. Investing activities used $117.6 of cash during 2003 compared with $357.2 and $323.5 during 2002 and 2001, respectively, reflecting an increase in proceeds related to the sale of non-core product lines and from the sale of marketable securities and investments, as well as lower capital expenditures than in the comparable periods. Capital expenditures were $302.1, $343.7 and $340.2 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital spending continues to be focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2004 are expected to be at the rate of approximately 3.0% to 3.5% of net sales. During 2003, the Company sold various detergent and certain non-core soap brands marketed in Europe for an aggregate sales price of $127.6. These non-core brands accounted for approximately 1% of the Company’s 2003 net sales. Certain detergent product lines in Central America were sold in 2001 for an aggregate sale price of $12.5. There were no significant divestitures in 2002. Proceeds from the sale of various marketable securities and investments include the settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. During 2003, long-term debt decreased to $2,999.3 from $3,509.3 in 2002 and total debt decreased to $3,102.9 in 2003 from $3,603.9 in 2002, primarily due to the Company’s strong free cash flow before dividends (defined below) and the proceeds from the sale of non-core brands, partially offset by share repurchases. The Company’s long-term debt has maintained a rating of AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. The Company currently issues commercial paper in the U.S., Canadian and European markets. Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $46.1 and $391.4, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Commercial paper outstanding during 2003 averaged $640.0 down from the $780.0 average in 2002. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2003 and 2002 was $920.0 and $1,100.0, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor’s rating of A1+ and a Moody’s rating of P1. The commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable of $562.4 are classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2003, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2007. Certain of the Company’s financing arrangements require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to debt. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain amounts payable to banks contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. In 1993, the Company formed a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors that purchases some of the Company’s receivables. The Company consolidates this entity, including such receivables, and reports the 13 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) amounts invested by outside investors as a minority interest. The purpose of this arrangement is to provide the Company access to low-cost sources of capital. During 2000, this subsidiary ceased operations resulting in a cash payment of $113.9 to the outside investors. In 2001, the subsidiary resumed operations with funding of $89.7 from outside investors. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions for employee benefit plans and to maintain its targeted capital structure. During 2003, the Company redeemed all outstanding shares of its $4.25 Preferred Stock at the stated redemption price of $100 per share. Aggregate repurchases for 2003 included 10.2 million common shares and .1 million shares of preferred stock for a total purchase price of $554.9. In 2002 and 2001, 20.3 million and 22.0 million shares were repurchased, respectively, with total purchase prices of $1,105.2 and $1,263.3, respectively. Dividend payments were $506.8, up from $413.4 in 2002 and $396.7 in 2001. Common stock dividend payments increased to $.90 per share in 2003 from $.72 per share in 2002 and $.68 per share in 2001. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments were increased to $7.20 per share in 2003 from $5.76 per share in 2002 and $5.40 in 2001. The Company’s annualized common stock and Series B Preference Stock dividends at December 31, 2003 were $.96 and $7.68 per share, respectively. The Company believes that internally generated cash flows are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures. Free cash flow before dividends was $1,465.6, $1,267.5 and $1,163.7 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company defines free cash flow before dividends as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. As management uses this measure to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain nondiscretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow before dividends is not a GAAP measurement and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operations to free cash flow before dividends follows: 2003 2002 2001 Net cash provided by operations $ 1,767.7 $ 1,611.2 $ 1,503.9 Less: Capital expenditures (302.1 ) (343.7 ) (340.2 ) Free cash flow before dividends $ 1,465.6 $ 1,267.5 $ 1,163.7 The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide. Accordingly, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its financing needs. At December 31, 2003, the Company had access to domestic and foreign unused lines of credit of $1,868.8 and also had $535.0 of medium-term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Company’s domestic lines of credit include a $1,300.0 facility maturing in May 2007 and a $30.0 364-day facility maturing in December 2004. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance. On December 18, 2003, the Company agreed to acquire GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. The transaction is structured as an all-cash acquisition of between 80% to 100% of the outstanding shares of GABA for an aggregate price ranging from 800 million Swiss francs to 1,050 million Swiss francs (approximately $645.0 to $846.5 based on December 31, 2003 exchange rates), depending on the number of shares acquired and subject to a purchase price adjustment. It is expected that substantially all the outstanding shares will be acquired by the Company. The acquisition is subject 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) to regulatory approvals in several European countries and other customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed within the next three to five months. The pending acquisition of GABA will be funded using a combination of debt, primarily short-term, and available cash balances with the majority anticipated to be repaid within 12 months of the closing of the acquisition. The portion of long-term debt, if any, will depend upon future market conditions and other factors. In connection with the financing of the GABA acquisition, the Company anticipates that the amount of its common stock repurchases during 2004 will decline as compared with 2003 levels. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Total Payments Due by Period 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion $ 2,949.6 $ 871.1 (1) $ 333.7 $ 265.0 $ 249.5 $ 212.9 $ 1,017.4 Capitalized leases 49.7 5.7 6.1 6.1 6.5 6.7 18.6 Operating leases 428.2 79.8 72.7 64.7 57.8 57.4 95.8 Purchase obligations(2) 583.1 225.7 146.7 101.4 70.4 38.9 — Total(3) $ 4,010.6 $ 1,182.3 $ 559.2 $ 437.2 $ 384.2 $ 315.9 $ 1,131.8 (1) Long-term debt due in 2004 includes $562.4 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2003, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis under its unused lines of credit which expire in 2007. (2) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2003 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts do not represent total anticipated purchases but represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify minimum quantity, price and term. (3) The Company intends to voluntarily contribute a minimum of $30.0 to benefit plans in the first half of 2004. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is party to various superfund and other environmental matters in connection with prior acquisitions. Substantially all of these liabilities have been acknowledged in writing as being covered by investment-grade insurance carriers that are presently making all their required payments directly to the cleanup efforts and are expected to do so in the future. The Company is also contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be affected by the one-time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows of the Company. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Restructuring Activities As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company incurred $59.3 of costs in connection with the realignment of certain manufacturing operations and workforce reduction programs. 15 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The components and related restructuring activity for 2003 are presented below: TerminationBenefits Incremental Depreciation Total Charges $ 38.2 $ 21.1 $ 59.3 Cash payments (5.5 ) — (5.5 ) Charges against assets — (21.1 ) (21.1 ) Restructuring accrual $ 32.7 $ — $ 32.7 Accrued termination benefits at December 31, 2003 are expected to be paid in 2004. Additional restructuring activities expected to be incurred in 2004 for related termination benefits and incremental depreciation are currently estimated at $11.4 for these activities. It is anticipated that the ongoing impact from the divestment of the non-core European detergents and soap brands combined with the effects of these restructuring activities will not result in a material impact on future earnings. Additionally, the Company continues to assess the further regionalization of manufacturing facilities to reduce costs and to streamline its operations. Costs for these restructuring activities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other (income) expense, net primarily in the Corporate segment as these decisions are corporate-driven and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a consolidated basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. With operations in over 200 countries and territories, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the European Union and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. The results of the Company’s commodity hedging activities are not material. 16 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long-term debt rating of AA-/Aa3 or higher. Value at Risk The Company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. The models utilize a variance/covariance modeling technique. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2003 and 2002. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Company’s results of operations in 2003 and 2002. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and a description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-14, “Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives,” and Issue No. 00-25, “Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products,” which relate to the classification of various types of sales incentives and promotional expenses. The Consolidated Statement of Income for 2001 has been revised to reflect the reclassification of certain sales incentives and promotional expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to a reduction of net sales and cost of sales; however, the revision had no impact on the Company’s financial position, net income or earnings per share. These reclassifications reduced net sales by $343.5 and cost of sales by $2.0 for the year ended December 31, 2001, with an offsetting reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets but requires annual impairment reviews. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, prior period amounts were not restated. A reconciliation of previously reported net income, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for 2001 to the amounts adjusted to exclude goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets amortization is presented in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 17 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options, shipping and handling costs, and inventories. • Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2003 would decrease approximately 3%. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) • Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs were included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent to sales would decrease from 55.0% to 52.1% in 2003 with no impact on reported earnings. • The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would be no impact on reported earnings for 2003, 2002 and 2001 if all inventories were accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. • In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for domestic plans was 6.25%, 6.75% and 7.25% as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As required, the discount rate is based upon published year-end rates on high-quality bonds. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was 8.0%, 8.0% and 9.0% as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rates of return. A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed return on plan assets would impact net income by approximately $7. A third, less significant assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.25%, 4.25% and 4.75% as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. • The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. In 2003, the assumed rate of increase was 9.0% for 2004 and declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by approximately $1.5. • Asset impairment analysis is primarily performed for intangible assets and requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair 18 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge. • Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. A significant change to the Company’s valuation allowances would primarily impact equity and would not materially impact reported earnings. • Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. It is management’s opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.) Outlook Looking forward into 2004, the Company is well positioned for continued growth in most of its markets. However, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration in many markets. In addition, movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of the euro may impact the overall results of Latin America and Europe. The Company expects the continued success of Colgate toothpaste, using patented and proprietary technology, to bolster worldwide Oral Care leadership and expects new products in Oral Care and other categories to add potential for further growth. Overall, subject to global economic conditions, the Company does not expect the 2004 market conditions to be materially different from those experienced in 2003 and the Company expects its positive momentum to continue. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Therefore, the Company constantly evaluates projects that will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced growth potential. Over the long term, Colgate’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder value. Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements In this report and from time to time, the Company may make statements that constitute or contain “forward-looking” information as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, earnings growth, financial goals, cost-reduction plans and new product introductions among other matters. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking 19 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) statements made by the Company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. The following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements: 1. Global Economic Conditions. The Company operates on a global basis, with approximately 70% of its net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. The Company is subject to the full range of economic risks, including those associated with international operations, such as economic recession, inflation, access to capital markets and related costs, movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates, return on pension assets, trade restrictions, tax law changes, political and legal instability, the imposition of trade restrictions and similar factors beyond the control of the Company. 2. Competition. The Company faces vigorous competition from multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same or greater resources than the Company. Such competition is based on pricing of products, promotional activities, advertising, new product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors, the timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the Company. The Company’s ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands, its ability to attract and retain key talent, and its ability to protect its patent, trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors. 3. Retail Trade. The Company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, electronic data transmission requirements and other conditions. With the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation, especially in developed markets such as the U.S. and Europe, the Company is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and these retailers, including large-format retailers, have increasingly greater bargaining strength and are reducing their inventory levels. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are becoming a source of competition for certain product lines of the Company. 4. Products. The Company’s growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors, as well as the continued success of existing products. In addition, the Company’s ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological innovations, to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and regulatory approvals, and to anticipate successfully consumer needs and preferences. 5. Cost Pressures. The Company’s ability to manage its cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in raw material prices and by unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, the Company’s move to global suppliers, to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business, has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. 6. Manufacturing. As a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality and safety issues, natural disasters and other external factors over which the Company has no control. 7. Acquisitions. From time to time the Company makes strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions have inherent risks, such as obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, retaining key personnel, integration of the acquired business, and achievement of planned synergies and projections. 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) ITEM 7A.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers, on a global basis, with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance helps to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments, North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Africa, which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hill’s also competes on a worldwide basis selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. To achieve its financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive growth and to fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, in particular by deploying valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis. Growth opportunities are enhanced in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, corporate-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. In June 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. Also, consistent with the Company’s strategy to de-emphasize heavy-duty detergents, the Company completed the sale of certain European and Latin American laundry detergent brands during 2003 and 2004, respectively. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share (with and without charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program described below); and measures to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Company’s corporate governance practices (including the Company’s Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained. In 2004, Net sales grew 7.0% driven by strong volume growth of 5.5%, despite increased competition in several of the Company’s key markets. These gains were driven by increased advertising and promotional support in key categories and markets, in line with the Company’s strategy to invest in its higher margin businesses. At the same time, however, raw and packing material costs increased. The combined increase in these costs and the higher advertising and promotional spending more than offset savings generated during the year by 7 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) the Company’s ongoing global cost-reduction programs. As a result, Operating profit for the year declined 2%, which included a $68.7 charge in connection with the four-year restructuring and business-building plan the Company announced and began implementing in December 2004 (the 2004 Restructuring Program). The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program along with the Company’s other ongoing cost-savings initiatives are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. For more information regarding the 2004 Restructuring Program, see “Restructuring Activities” below. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide sales were $10,584.2 in 2004. Sales increased 7.0% driven by volume gains of 5.5%, a decrease in net selling prices of 1.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 3.0%. The acquisition of GABA contributed 1.0% to worldwide sales and volume growth. Excluding the 2003 divestments of certain European detergent and soap brands and the 2004 divestment of certain detergents in Latin America, sales increased 8.0% on volume growth of 6.5%. Sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $9,151.1, up 6.5% from 2003 on volume growth of 5.5%, decreases in net selling prices of 2.0% and a 3.0% positive impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the divestments in Europe and Latin America, sales in this segment increased 8.0% on volume growth of 7.0%. Sales in Pet Nutrition grew 9.0% to $1,433.1, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, positive foreign exchange of 4.0% and an increase in net selling prices of 1.5%. In 2003, worldwide sales increased 6.5% to $9,903.4 on volume growth of 3.5%, increases in net selling prices of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%. Gross Profit Gross profit margin was 55.1% in 2004 compared to 55.0% in 2003 reflecting the Company’s shift toward higher margin oral care products and cost-savings programs partially offset by increased promotional spending, raw and packing material costs and restructuring charges of $3.4 related to accelerated depreciation and certain employee retention payments under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales. The increase in 2003 from the 2002 level of 54.6% was driven by the Company’s focus on its high margin oral and personal care businesses, savings from global sourcing, the regionalization of manufacturing facilities and other cost-reduction initiatives, despite an increase in worldwide materials costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 34.2% in 2004, 33.3% in 2003 and 32.6% in 2002. The 90-basis point (bps) increase as a percentage of sales in 2004 was primarily driven by increases in advertising spending (30 bps), selling and marketing costs (30 bps) and shipping and handling costs (20 bps). The increase as a percent of sales in 2003 resulted from increases in advertising of 60 bps and pension and other employee benefit costs of 40 bps, partially offset by savings from cost-control initiatives of 30 bps. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is advertising spending of $1,063.0, $965.6 and $897.9 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, supporting new product launches and helping increase market shares throughout the world. Additionally, total commercial investment behind the Company’s brands, including media, promotion and other consumer and trade incentives, some of which are recorded as a reduction of Net sales, increased by 13% in 2004 and 2003 and by 8% in 2002. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $90.3, ($15.0) and $23.0 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The changes year over year were driven by gains on sales of non-core brands and restructuring costs. 8 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Other (income) expense, net in 2004 included charges of $65.3 related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and a gain of $26.7 on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring Activities” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (income) expense, net in 2003 included gains of $107.2 ($63.5 aftertax) related to the sale of non-core brands partially offset by $59.3 ($39.0 aftertax) of costs related to the regionalization of manufacturing facilities, which combined resulted in a net benefit of $47.9 ($24.5 aftertax). The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2004 2003 2002 Minority interest $ 47.9 $ 45.2 $ 41.3 Amortization of intangible assets 14.3 12.3 12.5 Equity losses (income) (8.5 ) (.3 ) .6 Gains on sales of non-core product lines, net (26.7 ) (107.2 ) — 2004 Restructuring Program 65.3 — — 2003 restructuring activities 2.8 59.3 — Other, net (4.8 ) (24.3 ) (31.4 ) $ 90.3 $ (15.0 ) $ 23.0 Other, net consists primarily of miscellaneous gains and losses including gains and losses on interest rate and foreign currency hedge contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Operating Profit In 2004, Operating profit declined 2% to $2,122.1 after an 8% increase in 2003 to $2,166.0 from $2,013.1 in 2002. All years presented benefited from sales growth and cost savings initiatives. Additionally, 2004 included restructuring charges of $68.7 ($48.0 aftertax) in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program and other business realignment costs of $19.7 ($15.2 aftertax), as well as a gain of $26.7 ($15.0 aftertax) on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. Operating profit in 2003 reflected the net impact of $47.9 ($24.5 aftertax) related to the sales of non-core brands and restructuring activities. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $119.7 in 2004 compared with $124.1 in 2003 and $142.8 in 2002. Low interest rates have allowed the Company to lower its interest expense despite increased debt levels resulting from the GABA acquisition in 2004. The decrease in 2003 resulted from lower interest rates and debt levels. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 33.7% in 2004 versus 30.4% in 2003 and 31.1% in 2002. The increase in 2004 is due in part to changes in the mix of income in foreign tax rate jurisdictions and increased costs of remittances, while the effective tax rate was reduced in 2003 through the realization of tax credits and incentives, and as a result of global tax planning strategies including overseas asset revaluations. Net Income Net income was $1,327.1 in 2004 or $2.33 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,421.3 in 2003 or $2.46 per share and $1,288.3 in 2002 or $2.19 per share. As previously discussed, Net income in 2004 includes an aftertax charge of $48.0 ($.09 per share) associated with the initial phase of the 2004 Restructuring Program. Net income in 2003 includes a net aftertax benefit of $24.5 ($.04 per share) resulting from the gain on the sale of certain European detergent brands, partially offset by 2003 restructuring activities. 9 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Segment Results The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Segment performance is evaluated based on several factors, including operating profit. The Company uses operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to restructuring and related costs, interest expense, income taxes, and gains and losses on sales of non-core brands and assets.

In 2003, Net sales in Latin America declined 1.0% to $2,179.5 on 4.0% volume growth and increases in net selling prices of 7.5%, offset by the 12.5% negative impact of foreign currency declines primarily in Mexico, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and Colombia. Operating profit in Latin America increased 2% to $627.7 in 2004 reflecting increased sales and gross profit margins partially offset by higher advertising spending and shipping and handling costs. In 2003, Operating profit in Latin America decreased 5% to $613.3 due to negative foreign currency impact partially offset by volume growth and cost-control initiatives. Europe Net sales in Europe as reported increased 14.0% to $2,621.3 on 8.0% volume growth, a 9.0% positive impact of the stronger euro and other European currencies, and a 3.0% decline in net selling prices. Excluding the divested detergent and soap businesses, net sales increased 18.5% on volume gains of 12.5%. The GABA business added 5.5% to both sales and volume growth for the region. Strong volume gains were achieved in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Russia, Poland, Turkey, Romania, Hungary, Ukraine and the Adria region. Successful new products driving gains in Oral Care include Colgate Sensitive Plus Whitening, Colgate Total Advanced Fresh and Colgate Oxygen toothpastes and the Colgate Massager and Colgate 360° manual toothbrushes.

In 2003, Net sales in Europe increased 16.0% to $2,304.1 on volume gains of 3.0% and a 15.5% positive impact of stronger foreign currencies, primarily the euro, offset by a 2.5% decline in net selling prices. Operating profit in Europe increased 10% to $539.0 in 2004 and 19% to $488.2 in 2003 as a result of volume growth, gross margin improvement and the impact of stronger European currencies, partially offset by increased advertising. Asia/Africa Net sales in Asia/Africa as reported increased 8.0% to $1,885.1 on 7.0% volume growth, a 5.5% positive impact of foreign exchange and a 4.5% decline in net selling prices. Excluding divestments, sales increased 9.0% on volume gains of 8.0%. Healthy volume gains were achieved in China, India, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Australia, South Africa and the Middle East. Strong growth in Oral Care throughout the region was driven by new product launches including Colgate Herbal Whitening and Colgate Fresh Confidence Plus Whitening toothpastes and Colgate Massager manual toothbrush. Palmolive Aromatherapy shampoo and Palmolive Aroma Crème shower gel contributed to gains in Personal Care. In 2003, Net sales in Asia/Africa increased 13.5% to $1,747.5 on volume gains of 7.5% and the positive impact of 8.5% from foreign currencies offset by a 2.5% decrease in net selling prices. 11 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Operating profit grew 10% in Asia/Africa to $310.1 in 2004 and 21% to $280.7 in 2003, driven by volume gains and higher gross profit margins benefiting from the regionalization of manufacturing facilities as well as strong foreign currencies. Pet Nutrition Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 9.0% to $1,433.1, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, positive foreign exchange of 4.0% and an increase in net selling prices of 1.5%. Science Diet Feline dry food, Science Diet Large Breed Canine Senior and Science Diet Large Breed Canine Light contributed to gains in the U.S. specialty retail channel.

In 2003, Net sales for Pet Nutrition increased 11.0% to $1,316.1 on 4.5% volume growth, an increase of 1.5% in net selling prices and 5.0% in positive foreign currency impact. Operating profit in Pet Nutrition grew 5% to $389.7 in 2004 on increased sales and ongoing cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by higher advertising spending and a decline in gross profit margin reflecting a sharp rise in commodity costs early in the year. Operating profit for 2003 increased 17% to $371.0 as a result of strong volume gains and higher gross profit margins, as well as ongoing cost-savings initiatives. Corporate Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($274.5), ($134.6) and ($172.9) for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As previously discussed in Other (income) expense, net, the changes year over year were primarily driven by restructuring costs and gains on sales of non-core brands. Corporate operating expenses in 2004 include $68.7 of pretax charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and a $26.7 pretax gain on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. In 2003 corporate operating expenses were reduced by gains on the sale of non-core brands, net of costs related to the 2003 regionalization of manufacturing facilities and business realignment activities, which had a combined net impact of $51.5, as well as gains on interest rate and foreign currency hedge contracts used to hedge economic exposures but that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Restructuring Activities 2004 Restructuring Program In December 2004, the Company commenced a four-year restructuring and business-building program to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses (the 2004 Restructuring Program). As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one-third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and also plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions. Business-building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets, and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The 2004 Restructuring Program is expected to result in approximately a 12% reduction in employees over the next four years. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). The estimated cost in 2005 is $250-$325 ($175-$225 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325-$400 ($250-$300 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. The projected savings in 2005 are estimated at approximately $45 aftertax. Over the course of the four-year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50%-60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Management’s estimates of the cost and savings associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are forward-looking statements and are subject to revision over time. 12 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) During 2004 the Company incurred $68.7 ($48.0 aftertax) of charges in connection with the initial phase of the program related to restructuring activities in Europe (51%), North America (25%), Latin America (9%), Asia/Africa (7%) and Corporate (8%). These activities include the previously announced closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe and Asia/Africa, which will result in net headcount reductions of approximately 1,100 employees.

The Company incurred $2.8 and $59.3 of costs in 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to these restructuring activities which were substantially complete at the end of 2004. Costs for these restructuring activities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other (income) expense, net primarily in the Corporate segment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operations in 2004 was $1,754.3 compared with $1,767.7 in 2003 and $1,611.2 in 2002. Higher cash tax payments and working capital changes in 2004 contributed to a slight decline in operating cash flow as compared to the prior year. A portion of the increased tax payments reflected in net cash provided by operations during 2004 includes tax payments of $55 related to the prior sale of certain non-core brands. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of sales increased to 2.4% of sales in 2004 as compared with 1.7% of sales in 2003 primarily due to the accrued taxes in 2003 payable on the sale of non-core brands. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). From a working capital perspective, the Company’s inventory days coverage ratio has increased due to higher material costs and manufacturing and distribution changes while its receivable days sales outstanding ratio declined slightly. Investing activities used $1,090.4 of cash during 2004 compared with $117.6 and $357.2 during 2003 and 2002, respectively, predominantly due to payments for acquisitions. The Company’s acquisition of GABA is discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities in 2004 reflect $37.0 of proceeds from the sale of certain non-core detergent brands in Latin America, while during 2003, the Company 13 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) sold various detergent and certain non-core soap brands primarily marketed in Europe for an aggregate sales price of $127.6. Capital expenditures were $348.1, $302.1 and $343.7 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital spending continues to be focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to be at the rate of approximately 3.5% to 4.0% of Net sales. Financing activities used $611.1 of cash during 2004 compared with a use of $1,557.2 and $1,260.0 of cash during 2003 and 2002, respectively. Financing activities reflect financing related to the GABA acquisition, increases in common stock dividend payments and higher share repurchase activity during 2004. During 2004, long-term debt increased to $3,540.8 from $2,999.3 in 2003 and total debt increased to $3,675.1 in 2004 from $3,102.9 in 2003. The Company’s long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. The Company currently issues commercial paper in U.S., Canadian and European currencies, predominantly the Swiss franc. Commercial paper outstanding was $844.7 and $46.1 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2004 and 2003 was $1,519 and $920, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor’s rating of A1+ and a Moody’s rating of P1. The commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable totaling $852.5 are classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2004, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2007. Certain of the Company’s financing arrangements require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to debt. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain credit facilities contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill the requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock through December 31, 2005 (the 2004 Program). Aggregate repurchases for 2004, including repurchases under the 2004 Program and other Board authorizations, were 12.4 million common shares for a total purchase price of $637.9. Aggregate repurchases for 2003 were 10.2 million common shares and .1 million shares of preferred stock for a total purchase price of $554.9. In 2002, 20.3 million shares were repurchased for a total purchase price of $1,105.2. Dividend payments in 2004 were $536.2, up from $506.8 in 2003 and $413.4 in 2002. Common stock dividend payments increased to $.96 per share in 2004 from $.90 per share in 2003 and $.72 per share in 2002. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments were increased to $7.68 per share in 2004 from $7.20 per share in 2003 and $5.76 per share in 2002. The Company recently increased the annualized common stock dividend to $1.16 per share and the annualized Series B Preference Stock dividend to $9.28 per share effective in the second quarter of 2005. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from free cash flow. The Company believes that internally generated cash flows are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures. Free cash flow before dividends was $1,406.2, $1,465.6 and $1,267.5 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company defines free cash flow before dividends as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. As management uses this measure to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain nondiscretionary obligations, such as debt service, that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow before dividends is not a GAAP measurement 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operations to free cash flow before dividends follows: 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operations $ 1,754.3 $ 1,767.7 $ 1,611.2 Less: Capital expenditures (348.1 ) (302.1 ) (343.7 ) Free cash flow before dividends $ 1,406.2 $ 1,465.6 $ 1,267.5 In December 2004, the Company commenced the 2004 Restructuring Program, a four-year restructuring and business-building program, to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. It is anticipated that cash requirements for the restructuring program will be funded with operating cash flow. Accordingly, management expects that in 2005 the projected cash costs of $110-$125 associated with the program will have a negative impact on 2005 operating cash flow. The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide. Accordingly, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its financing needs. At December 31, 2004, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of approximately $2,200 and also had $431.8 of medium-term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Company’s domestic lines of credit include $1,300.0 in facilities expiring in May 2007 and facilities of $330.0 expiring in December 2005. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: Total Payments Due by Period 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion $ 3,496.0 $ 1,297.8 (1) $ 278.3 $ 750.5 $ 134.2 $ 95.2 $ 940.0 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2) 1,142.1 116.5 103.1 102.1 54.5 50.3 715.6 Capitalized leases 44.8 6.0 6.6 6.6 6.7 7.0 11.9 Operating leases 452.0 94.5 79.5 69.6 59.8 56.4 92.2 Purchase obligations(3) 703.4 394.2 141.3 69.2 51.8 19.3 27.6 Total(4) $ 5,838.3 $ 1,909.0 $ 608.8 $ 998.0 $ 307.0 $ 228.2 $ 1,787.3 (1) Long-term debt due in 2005 includes $852.5 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2004, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit that expire in 2007. (2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable-rate debt. (3) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2004 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. 15 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (4) Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of their cash flows. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan until 2012. Management’s best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Company’s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2005 is $99, including $55 of expected contributions to the Company’s postretirement plans. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is party to various superfund and other environmental matters in connection with prior acquisitions. Substantially all of these liabilities have been acknowledged in writing as being covered by the Company’s insurance carriers which are presently making all their required payments directly to the cleanup efforts and are expected to do so in the future. The Company is also contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be affected by the one-time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows of the Company. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. With operations in over 200 countries and territories, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the European Union and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. 16 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. The results of the Company’s commodity hedging activities are not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long-term debt rating of AA-/Aa3 or higher. Value at Risk The Company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2004 and 2003. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Company’s results of operations in 2004 and 2003. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” replacing SFAS No. 123 and superseding Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25. SFAS 123R requires public companies to recognize compensation expense for the cost of awards of equity compensation effective July 1, 2005. This compensation cost will be measured as the fair value of the award estimated using an option-pricing model on the grant date. The Company is currently evaluating the various transition provisions under SFAS 123R and will adopt SFAS 123R effective July 1, 2005, which is expected to result in increased compensation expense in future periods. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) was enacted on October 22, 2004. Among other provisions, the AJCA repeals an export incentive, creates a new deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities, and includes a special one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the U.S. The AJCA did not impact the Company’s 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements. The FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (FSP FAS 109-1) on December 21, 2004. In accordance with FSP FAS 109-1, the Company will treat the deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities as a reduction of the income tax provision in future years as realized. The deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in 2004, and this deduction combined with the phase-out of the export incentive is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate in 2005. 17 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (FSP FAS 109-2), allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the AJCA on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings. Management is currently evaluating recent tax law changes under the AJCA that create a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends. Currently, uncertainty remains as to how to interpret certain provisions under the AJCA. As such, the Company has not concluded its analysis to determine whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings. Based on the analysis to date, however, it is possible that the Company may repatriate approximately $500 under the provisions of the AJCA. While substantial uncertainty remains, the Company has presently estimated that the associated tax cost of this amount could range from $15 to $50. The Company expects to be in a position to finalize the assessment within a reasonable amount of time after the issuance of clarifying U.S. Treasury or Congressional guidance. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options, shipping and handling costs, and inventories. • At December 31, 2004, two alternative methods for accounting for stock options were available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option term until exercise and future stock price volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2004, 2003 and 2002 would have decreased approximately 3%. As noted above, effective July 1, 2005, SFAS 123R will require all companies issuing stock options to implement the fair value method and recognize compensation expense for stock options granted. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) • Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent to sales would have decreased from 55.1% to 47.9% in 2004 with no impact on reported earnings. • The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no impact on reported earnings for 2004, 2003 and 2002 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. 18 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. • In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for domestic plans was 5.75%, 6.25% and 6.75% as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As required, the discount rate is based upon published year-end rates on high-quality bonds. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rates of return. A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate on plan assets would impact Net income by approximately $8. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0%, 4.25% and 4.25% as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. • The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. In 2004, the assumed rate of increase was 10.0% for 2005 and declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $3.2. • Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable value. • Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. A significant change to the Company’s valuation allowances would primarily impact equity and would not materially impact reported earnings. • Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be affected by the one-time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.) 19 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Outlook In 2004, Net sales grew 7.0% driven by strong volume growth of 5.5%, despite increased competition in several of the Company’s key markets. These gains were driven by increased advertising and promotional support in key categories and markets, in line with the Company’s strategy to invest in its higher margin businesses. At the same time, however, raw and packing material costs increased. The combined increase in these costs and the higher advertising and promotional spending more than offset savings generated during the year by the Company’s ongoing global cost-reduction programs. As a result, Operating profit for the year declined 2%, which included a $68.7 charge in connection with the four-year restructuring and business-building plan the Company began implementing in December 2004. The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain, reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. Looking forward into 2005, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, it believes it is well positioned for continued growth. It anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Company’s other ongoing cost-savings initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. However, as noted above, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic and political uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of Latin American and European currencies may impact the overall results of these regions. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Over the long term, Colgate’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value. Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements In this report and from time to time, the Company may make statements that constitute or contain “forward-looking” information as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, earnings growth, financial goals, cost-reduction plans, estimated charges and savings associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program, and new product introductions among other matters. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements made by the Company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. The following are some of the factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements: 1. Global Economic Conditions. The Company operates on a global basis, with approximately 70% of its net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. The Company is subject to the full range of economic risks, particularly those associated with international operations. These economic risks include recession, inflation, access to capital markets, movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates, return on pension assets, tax law changes, political and legal instability, the imposition of trade restrictions and similar factors beyond the control of the Company. 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2. Competition. The Company faces vigorous competition from multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same or greater resources than the Company. Such competition is based on pricing of products, promotional activities, advertising, new product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors, the timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the Company. The Company’s ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands, its ability to attract and retain key talent, and its ability to protect its patent, trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors. 3. Retail Trade. The Company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, electronic data transmission requirements and other conditions. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, especially in developed markets such as the U.S. and Europe, the Company is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and these retailers, including large-format retailers, have increasingly greater bargaining strength and are reducing their inventory levels. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are a source of competition for certain product lines of the Company. 4. Products. The Company’s growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors, as well as the continued success of existing products. In addition, the Company’s ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological innovations, to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection, to obtain governmental approvals and registrations of regulated products, to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations and to anticipate successfully consumer needs and preferences. 5. Cost Pressures. The Company’s ability to manage its cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in commodity and other raw material prices such as those experienced during 2004, and by unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, the Company’s move to global suppliers, to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business, has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. 6. 2004 Restructuring Program. In December 2004, the Company commenced the 2004 Restructuring Program, a four-year restructuring and business-building program to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. This program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations. There can be no assurance that the 2004 Restructuring Program will be completed in accordance with the planned timetable, that the actual charges incurred will not exceed the estimated charges or that the full extent of the expected savings will be realized. 7. Manufacturing. As a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which the Company has no control. 8. Acquisitions. From time to time the Company makes strategic acquisitions, such as the June 2004 acquisition of GABA. Acquisitions have inherent risks, such as obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, retaining key personnel, integration of the acquired business, and achievement of planned synergies and projections. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers, on a global basis, with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance helps to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments, North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Africa, which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hill’s also competes on a worldwide basis selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share; and measures to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Company’s corporate governance practices (including the Company’s Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained. To achieve its financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive growth and to fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, in particular by deploying valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis. Growth opportunities are enhanced in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, corporate-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. In June 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. Also, consistent with the Company’s strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, the Company divested its North American and Southeast Asian heavy-duty laundry detergent brands in the third and fourth quarter of 2005, respectively, and certain Latin American and European laundry detergent brands during 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 2004, the Company commenced a four-year restructuring and business-building program to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses (the 2004 Restructuring Program). As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates the rationalization of approximately one-third of its manufacturing facilities, closure of certain warehousing facilities and an estimated 12% workforce 11 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) reduction. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325-$400 ($250-$300 aftertax) annually by 2008. Given the continued competitive marketplace and high raw and packaging material and energy costs, the Company anticipates that the near-term operating environment will remain challenging. However, the savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program along with the Company’s other ongoing cost-savings and growth initiatives are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide sales were $11,396.9 in 2005. Sales increased 7.5% driven by volume gains of 5.5%, an increase in net selling prices of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 1.5%. The June 2004 acquisition of GABA contributed 1.0% to worldwide sales and volume growth. Excluding the divestment of non-core product lines, sales increased 8.5% on volume growth of 6.5%. Sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $9,876.7, up 8.0% from 2004 on volume growth of 5.5%, increases in net selling prices of 0.5% and a 2.0% positive impact of foreign exchange. Excluding divestments, sales in this segment increased 9.0% on volume growth of 6.5%. Sales in Pet Nutrition grew 6.0% to $1,520.2, driven by volume growth of 4.0%, an increase in net selling prices of 1.5% and positive foreign exchange of 0.5%. In 2004, worldwide sales increased 7.0% to $10,584.2 on volume growth of 5.5%, a decrease in net selling prices of 1.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 3.0%. Gross Profit Gross profit margin was 54.4% in 2005, 55.1% in 2004 and 55.0% in 2003. The reduction in gross profit during 2005 is driven primarily by costs associated with the Company’s ongoing 2004 Restructuring Program. Restructuring charges of $100.2, which related to accelerated depreciation and certain employee termination benefits under the 2004 Restructuring Program, were included in Cost of sales. These charges reduced gross profit margin by approximately 90 basis points (bps) for the year ended 2005. The benefits from higher pricing, the Company’s shift towards higher margin oral care products and cost-saving programs in 2005 more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs. The increase in 2004 from the 2003 level was driven by the Company’s focus on its high margin oral and personal care businesses, savings from global sourcing, the regionalization of manufacturing facilities and other cost-reduction initiatives, despite an increase in worldwide materials costs. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring Activities” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 34.4% in 2005, 34.2% in 2004 and 33.3% in 2003. Advertising expense increased by 12% in 2005, an increase of 40 bps as a percent of sales, on top of a 10% increase in 2004. Included in Selling, general and administrative expenses is advertising spending of $1,193.6, $1,063.0 and $965.6 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, supporting new product 12 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) launches and helping increase market shares throughout the world. Despite the 40 bps increase in advertising, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2005 only increased by a net 20 bps as ongoing cost-savings programs more than offset increases in shipping and handling costs (30 bps) and selling and marketing costs (10 bps). The increase as a percent of sales in 2004 as compared with 2003 resulted from increases in advertising spending (30 bps), selling and marketing costs (30 bps) and shipping and handling costs (20 bps). Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $69.2, $90.3 and ($15.0) in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2005 2004 2003 Minority interest $ 55.3 $ 47.9 $ 45.2 Amortization of intangible assets 15.6 14.3 12.3 Equity (income) (2.0 ) (8.5 ) (0.3 ) Gains on sales of non-core product lines, net (147.9 ) (26.7 ) (107.2 ) 2004 Restructuring Program 80.8 65.3 — 2003 restructuring activities — 2.8 59.3 Pension and other postretirement charges 34.0 — — Investment losses (income) 19.7 (8.7 ) (39.6 ) Other, net 13.7 3.9 15.3 $ 69.2 $ 90.3 $ (15.0 ) Other (income) expense, net in 2005 included a gain of $147.9 on the sale of heavy-duty laundry detergent businesses in North America and Southeast Asia, which was partially offset by charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program of $80.8 and pension and other postretirement charges of $34.0. The charges associated with certain pension and other postretirement obligations were primarily a result of the conversion of one of the Company’s international pension plans to a defined contribution plan for all eligible participants and a lump sum payment of normal retirement benefits associated with a retirement plan in the U.S. as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits” (SFAS 88). Investment losses (income) consists primarily of gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, which are economic hedges of certain foreign currency debt, but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Other (income) expense, net in 2004 included charges of $65.3 related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and a gain of $26.7 on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. Other (income) expense, net in 2003 included gains of $107.2 related to the sale of non-core brands partially offset by $59.3 of costs related to the regionalization of manufacturing facilities. Operating Profit In 2005, Operating profit increased 4% to $2,215.0 after a 2% decline in 2004 to $2,122.1 from $2,166.0 in 2003. All years presented benefited from sales growth and cost-savings initiatives. The gain on sale of non-core product lines recognized in 2005 and 2004 was more than offset by pretax restructuring charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program of $182.8 and $68.7 in 2005 and 2004, respectively, as well as other business realignment costs of $19.7 in 2004. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring Activities” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 13 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $136.0 in 2005 compared with $119.7 in 2004 and $124.1 in 2003. Higher interest rates and higher average debt levels primarily to finance the GABA acquisition have resulted in increased interest expense in 2005. In 2004 low interest rates allowed the Company to lower its interest expense despite increased debt levels resulting from the GABA acquisition. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 35.0% in 2005 versus 33.7% in 2004 and 30.4% in 2003. The higher tax rate in 2005 is due to $40.9 of income taxes (200 bps) for the incremental repatriation of $780 of foreign earnings related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) as well as the impact (130 bps) of the lower effective benefit rate on charges incurred in connection with the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program. These increases were partially offset by the Company’s global tax planning strategies which are reflected principally in overseas earnings being taxed at lower rates. The increase in 2004 is due in part to changes in the mix of income in foreign tax rate jurisdictions and increased costs of remittances, while the effective tax rate was reduced in 2003 through the realization of tax credits and incentives, and as a result of global tax planning strategies including overseas asset revaluations. The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period will depend upon the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. Since the majority of restructuring costs have been incurred in low tax jurisdictions, the tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2005 and 2004 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 20.6% and 30.1%, respectively. Over its duration, charges associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are projected to generate tax benefits at a rate between 25% and 30%. For additional information refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income Net income was $1,351.4 in 2005 or $2.43 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,327.1 in 2004 or $2.33 per share and $1,421.3 in 2003 or $2.46 per share. As discussed above, Net income in 2005 was impacted by a net aftertax charge of $115.2 ($0.21 per share) resulting from restructuring charges, gains on sales of certain non-core brands, income tax expense for the incremental repatriation of foreign earnings related to the AJCA and certain pension charges. Net income in 2004 includes an aftertax charge of $48.0 ($0.09 per share) associated with the initial phase of the 2004 Restructuring Program. Segment Results The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Segment performance is evaluated based on several factors, including operating profit. The Company uses operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to restructuring and related costs, interest expense, income taxes, and gains and losses on sales of non-core brands and assets. 14 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Worldwide Net Sales by Business Segment and Geographic Region 2005 2004 2003 Oral, Personal and Home Care North America(1) $ 2,509.8 $ 2,378.7 $ 2,356.2 Latin America 2,623.8 2,266.0 2,179.5 Europe 2,739.4 2,621.3 2,304.1 Asia/Africa 2,003.7 1,885.1 1,747.5 Total Oral, Personal and Home Care 9,876.7 9,151.1 8,587.3 Pet Nutrition(2) 1,520.2 1,433.1 1,316.1 Net Sales $ 11,396.9 $ 10,584.2 $ 9,903.4 (1) Net sales in the U.S. for Oral, Personal and Home Care were $2,124.2, $2,000.3 and $1,986.9 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Operating profit in North America increased 3% to $545.7 in 2005 as increased sales were partially offset by declines in gross profit margin reflecting increased raw and packaging material costs. In 2004, Operating profit in North America declined 3% to $530.1 due to increased shipping and handling costs and declines in gross profit margin reflecting increased commercial investment and higher raw material costs. Latin America Net sales in Latin America increased 16.0% to $2,623.8 as a result of 7.0% volume growth, increases in net selling prices of 4.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.0%. Net sales, excluding divested detergent 15 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) businesses in Ecuador and Peru, increased 16.5% on volume gains of 7.5%.

Other new products which drove growth in Latin America are Colgate MicroSonic battery-powered toothbrush, Colgate Smiles line of manual toothbrushes for kids, Palmolive Nutri-Milk and Protex Oats bar soaps, and Lady Speed Stick and Speed Stick multiform deodorants. In 2004, Net sales in Latin America increased 4.0% to $2,266.0 on 6.0% volume growth, increases in net selling prices of 1.5% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 3.5%. Operating profit in Latin America increased 11% to $698.0 in 2005 despite an increased level of advertising, reflecting increased sales and gross profit margins and a positive impact from foreign exchange. In 2004, Operating profit in Latin America increased 2% to $627.7 reflecting increased sales and gross profit margins partially offset by higher advertising spending and shipping and handling costs. Europe Net sales in Europe increased 4.5% to $2,739.4 on 6.0% volume growth, a 0.5% positive impact of stronger currencies, and a 2.0% decline in net selling prices. Excluding divestments, net sales increased 5.0% on volume gains of 6.5%. The June 2004 acquisition of GABA contributed 4.0% to European sales and volume growth. Volume gains achieved at GABA and in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Spain, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Romania, the Adria region, Poland and the Baltic States more than offset challenging economic conditions in Italy, France and Germany. New products which contributed to these gains include Colgate Sensitive Plus Whitening, Colgate Oxygen and Colgate Max Fresh toothpastes, Colgate 360° manual toothbrush and Colgate MicroSonic battery-powered toothbrush. Growth in the region was also driven by strong sales of Colgate Total, Colgate Cavity Protection Extra Mint and Colgate Sensitive toothpastes and Colgate Smiles line of manual toothbrushes for kids.

Operating profit in Europe increased 2% to $547.3 in 2005 and 10% to $539.0 in 2004 reflecting in both years volume growth and increased gross profit margins partially offset by an increased level of advertising. Additionally, operating profit in 2004 benefited from stronger currencies. Asia/Africa Net sales in Asia/Africa increased 6.5% to $2,003.7 on 6.0% volume growth, a 1.5% positive impact of foreign exchange and a 1.0% decline in net selling prices. Volume gains were achieved in Taiwan, China, India, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia and South Africa.

New products which contributed to growth in other categories throughout the region include Palmolive Aroma Creme shower gel and liquid hand soap, Protex Sun Care bar soap and Palmolive Naturals shampoo and conditioner. In 2004, Net sales in Asia/Africa increased 8.0% to $1,885.1 on 7.0% volume growth, a 5.5% positive impact of foreign exchange and a 4.5% decline in net selling prices. Operating profit grew 3% in Asia/Africa to $318.0 in 2005 as a result of volume growth, which more than offset an increased level of advertising and higher shipping and handling costs. In 2004, Operating profit in Asia/Africa increased 10% to $310.1 driven by volume gains and higher gross profit margins as well as strong foreign currencies. 16 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Pet Nutrition Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 6.0% to $1,520.2, driven by volume growth of 4.0%, an increase in net selling prices of 1.5% and positive foreign exchange of 0.5%. Innovative new products which contributed to growth in the U.S. specialty retail channel included Science Diet Canine Lamb & Rice Large Breed, Science Diet Canine Lamb & Rice Small Bites and Science Diet Indoor Cat pet foods. In the U.S. veterinary channel products which contributed to growth were Prescription Diet Canine j/d, a new wet form of Prescription Diet Canine z/d and Prescription Diet Feline z/d and the relaunch of Prescription Diet d/d (Canine and Feline) with an upgraded formulation. Internationally, growth was strong led by Taiwan, Russia, Australia, Spain and South Africa. New products which contributed to international growth included Science Diet Canine Large Breed, Prescription Diet Canine j/d, the wet form of Prescription Diet Canine z/d and Prescription Diet Feline z/d and the relaunch of Prescription Diet d/d. In 2004, Net sales for Pet Nutrition increased 9.0% to $1,433.1 on 3.5% volume growth, an increase of 1.5% in net selling prices and 4.0% in positive foreign currency impact. Operating profit in Pet Nutrition grew 6% to $412.8 in 2005 on increased sales and gross profit margins partially offset by higher advertising and increased shipping and handling costs. Operating profit for 2004 increased 5% to $389.7 as a result of increased sales and ongoing cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by higher advertising spending and a decline in gross profit margin reflecting a sharp rise in commodity costs early in the year. Corporate Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($306.8), ($274.5) and ($134.6) for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As previously discussed in Other (income) expense, net, the change in 2005 as compared with the prior year was primarily driven by restructuring charges, gains on sales of certain non-core brands and charges relating to certain pension obligations. Corporate operating expenses in 2004 include $68.7 of pretax charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and a $26.7 pretax gain on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. Restructuring Activities 2004 Restructuring Program In December 2004, the Company commenced a four-year restructuring and business-building program to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses (the 2004 Restructuring Program). As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one-third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and also plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions. Business-building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets, and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The 2004 Restructuring Program is expected to result in approximately a 12% workforce reduction. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). The estimated cost in 2006 is $300-$350 ($225-$250 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325-$400 ($250-$300 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. Over the course of the four-year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50%-60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. While the Company’s initial estimates remain unchanged, charges and savings may vary in a given year. Management’s estimates of the cost and savings associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are forward-looking statements and are subject to revision over time. 17 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) During 2004, in connection with the initial phase of the program, the Company announced the closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe and Asia/Africa. During 2005, the Company commenced additional projects the more significant of which related to changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. These changes will allow the Company to more cost effectively manufacture toothpaste, taking advantage of state-of-the-art technologies, and obtain cost-savings through the transfer of bar soap manufacturing to an established U.S. third party. The Company plans to consolidate toothpaste production in Europe, which is currently located at five company sites, into a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Europe. Upon completion of the consolidation project over two years, toothpaste manufacturing is expected to cease at the Company’s facilities in Salford, United Kingdom; Anzio, Italy; Brasov, Romania; Gebze, Turkey; and Halinow, Poland. Other manufacturing activities will continue at these sites, except the Salford facility, which is expected to be closed. In North America, the Company plans to phase down production at its Jeffersonville, Indiana plant over the next two years, with all production expected to cease by January 2008. The plan calls for transferring production of the Company’s market leading Colgate Total toothpaste to a new state-of-the-art facility to be built in Morristown, Tennessee, and the relocation of other production and administrative services currently performed at Jeffersonville to other facilities. Additionally, the Company’s Kansas City, Kansas facility, where bar soap is currently produced, is expected to be closed in late 2006 after all production is transitioned to an established U.S. third party manufacturer. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total charges of $251.5 ($193.1 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects. The majority of costs incurred to date relate to the following significant projects: the consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Canada and Kansas City; and a realignment of the sales and administrative functions in Germany. In the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company incurred $182.8 ($145.1 aftertax) of charges in connection with restructuring and implementation related activities, as detailed below: Year Ended December 31, 2005 Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2004 $ 41.7 $ — $ — $ 0.4 $ 42.1 Charges 45.8 65.3 30.2 41.5 182.8 Cash payments (47.8 ) — — (23.4 ) (71.2 ) Non-cash activity — (65.3 ) (30.2 ) (15.0 ) (110.5 ) Foreign exchange (4.4 ) — — (0.1 ) (4.5 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2005 $ 35.3 $ — $ — $ 3.4 $ 38.7 Charges in the period related to restructuring activities in Europe (48%), North America (29%), Latin America (4%), Asia/Africa (11%), Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (7%) and are reflected in the Corporate segment in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of sales ($100.2), Selling, general and administrative expenses ($1.8) and Other (income) expense, net ($80.8). 18 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) During 2004 the Company incurred $68.7 ($48.0 aftertax) of charges in connection with the initial phase of the 2004 Restructuring Program, as detailed below: Year Ended December 31, 2004 Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Charges $ 41.6 $ 3.3 $ 22.0 $ 1.8 $ 68.7 Cash payments (1.4 ) — — (1.4 ) (2.8 ) Non-cash activity — (3.3 ) (22.0 ) — (25.3 ) Foreign exchange 1.5 — — — 1.5 Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2004 $ 41.7 $ — $ — $ 0.4 $ 42.1 Charges in the period related to restructuring activities in Europe (51%), North America (25%), Latin America (9%), Asia/Africa (7%) and Corporate (8%) and are reflected in the Corporate segment in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of sales ($3.4) and Other (income) expense, net ($65.3). 2003 Restructuring Activities In connection with the European brand divestments during 2003 and the Company’s ongoing focus on the regionalization of manufacturing facilities to streamline and strengthen its operations, the Company realigned certain manufacturing operations and implemented workforce reduction programs primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia/Africa. The Company incurred $2.8 and $59.3 of costs in 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to these restructuring activities which were substantially complete at the end of 2004. Costs for these restructuring activities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other (income) expense, net primarily in the Corporate segment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operations in 2005 was $1,784.4 as compared with $1,754.3 in 2004 and $1,767.7 in 2003. The increase in 2005 reflects the Company’s improved profitability and working capital management despite $38.0 of increased spending related to restructuring activities. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of sales decreased to 1.7% of sales in 2005 as compared with 2.4% of sales in 2004. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). As a result of an increased focus on working capital management, the Company’s receivable days sales outstanding and inventory days coverage improved from 2004. Additionally, working capital at December 31, 2005 includes an increase of approximately $40 of accrued liabilities related to taxes and other costs associated with the Company’s sale of certain non-core brands in 2005. Investing activities used $220.7 of cash during 2005 compared with $1,090.4 and $117.6 during 2004 and 2003, respectively, with the 2004 period reflecting the Company’s acquisition of GABA. In 2005, the Company increased its ownership interests in certain overseas subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of $38.5, primarily related to its Malaysia subsidiary. Investing activities in 2005 reflect $215.6 of proceeds from the sales of the Company’s Southeast Asian and North American heavy-duty laundry detergent brands, as compared with 2004 which reflects $37.0 of proceeds from the sale of certain non-core detergent brands in Latin America, and with 2003 when the Company sold various detergent and certain non-core soap brands primarily marketed in Europe for an aggregate sales price of $127.6. Capital expenditures were $389.2, $348.1 and $302.1 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capital spending continues to be focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. As a result of the Company’s multi-year restructuring and business-building program, overall capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to increase to a rate of approximately 4.0% to 4.5% of Net sales. 19 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Financing activities used $1,524.4 of cash during 2005 compared with a use of $611.1 and $1,557.2 of cash during 2004 and 2003, respectively. Financing activities in 2005 reflect increases in the common and preference stock dividend payments as well as higher share repurchases associated with the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2004. Financing activities in 2004 reflect an increased level of proceeds associated with borrowings related to the GABA acquisition. During 2005, long-term debt decreased to $3,274.7 from $3,540.8 in 2004 and total debt decreased to $3,446.2 in 2005 from $3,675.1 in 2004. The Company’s long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Commercial paper outstanding was $621.8 and $844.7 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, is denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2005 and 2004 was $1,715 and $1,519, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor’s rating of A-1+ and a Moody’s rating of P-1. The commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable totaling $641.9 are classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2005, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2010. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain credit facilities contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. The Company had a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors the purpose of which was to purchase some of the Company’s receivables thereby giving the Company access to additional sources of capital. The subsidiary, including such receivables, was consolidated and the amounts invested by outside investors were reported as a minority interest. During 2005, the subsidiary ceased operations resulting in a cash payment to the outside investors of $89.7. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill the requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock through December 31, 2005 (the 2004 Program) and, in December 2005, the Board of Directors extended this authorization through March 31, 2006. It is anticipated that the remaining 2.5 million shares under the current program will be repurchased in the first quarter of 2006 and that the Company will implement a new stock repurchase program to take effect upon the conclusion of the 2004 Program. Aggregate repurchases for 2005, including repurchases under the 2004 Program and other Board authorizations, were 15.1 million common shares for a total purchase price of $796.2. Aggregate repurchases for 2004 were 12.4 million common shares for a total purchase price of $637.9. In 2003, 10.2 million common shares and 0.1 million shares of preferred stock were repurchased for a total purchase price of $554.9. Dividend payments in 2005 were $607.2, up from $536.2 in 2004 and $506.8 in 2003. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.11 per share in 2005 from $0.96 per share in 2004 and $0.90 per share in 2003. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments were increased to $8.88 per share in 2005 from $7.68 per share in 2004 and $7.20 per share in 2003. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from free cash flow. The Company believes that internally generated cash flows are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures. Free cash flow before dividends was $1,395.2, $1,406.2 and $1,465.6 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company defines free cash flow before dividends as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. As management uses this measure to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash 20 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain nondiscretionary obligations, such as debt service, that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow before dividends is not a GAAP measurement and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operations to free cash flow before dividends follows: 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operations $ 1,784.4 $ 1,754.3 $ 1,767.7 Less: Capital expenditures (389.2 ) (348.1 ) (302.1 ) Free cash flow before dividends $ 1,395.2 $ 1,406.2 $ 1,465.6 In December 2004, the Company commenced the 2004 Restructuring Program, a four-year restructuring and business-building program, to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. It is anticipated that cash requirements for the restructuring program will continue to be funded from operating cash flow. The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its financing needs. At December 31, 2005, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of approximately $2,400 and also had $1,754.4 of medium-term notes available for issuance pursuant to effective shelf registration statements. In November 2005, the Company entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 with a syndicate of banks. The facility, which expires in November 2010, replaces existing credit facilities of $300.0 and $1,300.0 which were due to expire in December 2005 and May 2007, respectively. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance. During 2005, the Company also issued 250 million of Swiss franc-denominated five-year bonds (approximately $190 at the year-end exchange rate) at a fixed rate of 1.9%. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005: Total Payments Due by Period 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion $ 3,239.1 $ 992.8 (1) $ 701.5 $ 153.4 $ 95.2 $ 280.6 $ 1,015.6 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2) 1,263.0 176.0 104.5 79.1 72.8 64.9 765.7 Capitalized leases 35.6 5.8 6.1 6.2 6.4 6.7 4.4 Operating leases 474.7 94.6 86.0 76.5 68.6 54.2 94.8 Purchase obligations(3) 675.8 427.7 155.1 72.7 6.3 5.7 8.3 Total(4) $ 5,688.2 $ 1,696.9 $ 1,053.2 $ 387.9 $ 249.3 $ 412.1 $ 1,888.8 (1) Long-term debt due in 2006 includes $641.9 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2005, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit that expire in 2010. (2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. 21 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (3) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2005 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. (4) Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2014. Management’s best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Company’s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2006 is $126. This estimate includes $77 of expected contributions to the Company’s postretirement plans, the majority of which relate to voluntary contributions to the U.S. plans. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by the one-time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or ongoing results of operations and cash flows. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. With operations in over 200 countries and territories, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in Europe and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. 22 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. In 2005 the results of the Company’s commodity hedging activities were not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long-term debt rating of AA-/Aa3 or higher. Value at Risk The Company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2005 and 2004. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Company’s results of operations in 2005 and 2004. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs—An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4” (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to conversion costs be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in SFAS 151 must be applied prospectively to the Company’s inventory costs incurred on or after January 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 151 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123) by eliminating the choice to account for employee stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25), and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. Currently under APB 25 the value of restricted stock awards is expensed by the Company over the restriction period and, no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants as all such grants have an exercise price not less than fair market value on the date of grant. Additionally, certain of the Company’s stock options granted to eligible participants have an accelerated vesting feature associated with employee retirement and most of the restricted stock awards specify that 23 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) participants will continue to vest in the award after retirement. Currently the Company follows the nominal vesting period approach, which requires recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period except in the instance of the participants’ actual retirement. Upon the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company’s policy regarding the timing of expense recognition for new awards to employees eligible for retirement will, as required, be changed to recognize compensation cost over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method which will result in an incremental expense upon adoption. The impact on earnings per share in fiscal year 2006 of these requirements is currently estimated in the range of $0.09 to $0.10. Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in the Company’s assumptions or changes in market conditions. Due to the timing of the Company’s equity grants the charge will not be spread evenly throughout the year. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required, thereby potentially reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Such amounts cannot be estimated for future periods with certainty because they depend largely on when employees will exercise the stock options and the market price of the Company’s stock at the time of exercise. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options, shipping and handling costs, and inventories. • During 2005, two alternative methods for accounting for stock options were available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company used the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2005, 2004 and 2003 would have decreased approximately 3%. SFAS 123R will require all companies issuing stock options to implement the fair value method and recognize compensation expense for stock options granted. As noted above, the Company will adopt SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) • Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent to sales would have decreased by 750 bps from 54.4% to 46.9% in 2005 and decreased by 720 bps and 710 bps in 2004 and 2003, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings. 24 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) • The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (approximately 80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2005, 2004 and 2003 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. • In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. plans was 5.50%, 5.75% and 6.25% as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return. The historical rate of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15-year period was 9%. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 35% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long term), 61% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 10% in the long term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0%, 4.0% and 4.25% as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) • The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. In 2005, the assumed rate of increase was 10.0% for 2006 and declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $4.5. • Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable value. • Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. A significant change to the Company’s valuation allowances would primarily impact equity and would not materially impact reported earnings. • Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially 25 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) affected by the one-time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or ongoing results of operations and cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.) Outlook Looking forward into 2006, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, it believes it is well positioned for continued growth. It anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share. The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain, reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Company’s other ongoing cost-savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. However, as noted above, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic and political uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of Latin American and European currencies may impact the overall results of these regions. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Over the long term, Colgate’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers, on a global basis, with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance helps to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments, North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hill’s also competes on a worldwide basis selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share; and measures to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Company’s corporate governance practices (including the Company’s Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained. To achieve its financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive growth and to fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, in particular by deploying valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis. Growth opportunities are enhanced in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, corporate-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher-margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. The Company purchased Tom’s of Maine, Inc. in the second quarter of 2006. This acquisition allowed the Company to enter the fast growing health and specialty trade channel where Tom’s of Maine toothpaste and deodorant are market leaders. In 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. Consistent with the Company’s strategy to prioritize higher-margin businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company announced its agreement to sell its Latin American and Canadian bleach brands. The transaction closed in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2006. The Latin American transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2007. Also, consistent with this strategy the Company divested its North American and Southeast Asian heavy-duty laundry detergent brands during 2005. 11 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In December 2004, the Company commenced a four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of this program the Company anticipates the rationalization of approximately one-third of the Company’s manufacturing facilities, closure of certain warehousing facilities and an estimated 12% workforce reduction. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all the phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325 and $400 ($250 and $300 aftertax) annually by 2008. Looking forward into 2007, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, the Company believes it is well positioned for continued growth. As further explained in the Outlook section of Part II, Item 7 of this report, over the long-term, the Company’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide sales were $12,237.7 in 2006, up 7.5% from 2005 driven by unit volume gains of 5.5%, net selling price increases of 1.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 0.5%. Excluding the impact of the 2005 divestment of the Company’s heavy-duty laundry detergent business in North America and Southeast Asia, sales increased 9.0% in 2006 on volume growth of 7.0%. Sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $10,568.6 in 2006, up 7.0% from 2005 driven by volume growth of 5.0%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 1.0%. Excluding the impact of the 2005 divestments of the Company’s heavy-duty laundry detergent business in North America and Southeast Asia, sales increased 9.0% on volume growth of 7.0%. The May 2006 acquisition of Tom’s of Maine, Inc. did not have a material impact on reported sales, net income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006. Sales in Pet Nutrition were $1,669.1 in 2006, up 10.0% from 2005 driven by volume growth of 6.0% and net selling price increases of 4.5%, offset by a 0.5% negative impact of foreign exchange. In 2005, worldwide sales were $11,396.9. Sales increased 7.5% from 2004 driven by volume gains of 5.5%, an increase in net selling prices of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 1.5%. Gross Profit Gross profit margin was 54.8% in 2006, 54.4% in 2005 and 55.1% in 2004. In 2006, Gross profit benefited from higher pricing, a continued focus on cost-savings programs and the shift toward higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs and increased restructuring charges. Restructuring charges of $196.2 for the year ended December 31, 2006, which related to accelerated depreciation and certain employee termination benefits under the 2004 Restructuring Program, were included in Cost of sales. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 included restructuring charges of $100.2. These charges lowered the reported gross profit margin by 160 basis points (bps) and 90 bps in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The reduction in gross profit margin in 2005 from 2004 was driven by costs associated with the Company’s ongoing 2004 Restructuring Program. In 2005, the benefits from higher pricing, the Company’s shift towards higher margin oral care products and cost-savings programs more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs. 12 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring Activities” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 35.6% in 2006, 34.4% in 2005, and 34.2% in 2004. The 120 bps increase in 2006 was driven by higher levels of advertising (30 bps), charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program (40 bps) and incremental stock-based compensation expense recognized as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R) (60 bps). During 2006, the increase in gross profit margin and other savings programs funded an increase in advertising of 11% to $1,320.3, on top of a 12% increase in 2005, to $1,193.6, supporting new product launches and helping increase market shares throughout the world. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2005 only increased by a net 20 bps despite a 40 bps increase in advertising as ongoing cost-savings programs more than offset increases in shipping and handling costs (30 bps) and selling and marketing costs (10 bps). Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $185.9, $69.2, and $90.3 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2006 2005 2004 Minority interest $ 57.5 $ 55.3 $ 47.9 Amortization of intangible assets 16.3 15.6 14.3 Equity (income) (3.4 ) (2.0 ) (8.5 ) Gains on sales of non-core product lines, net (46.5 ) (147.9 ) (26.7 ) 2004 Restructuring Program 153.1 80.8 65.3 2003 restructuring activities — — 2.8 Pension and other retiree benefits — 34.0 — Investment losses (income) (5.7 ) 19.7 (8.7 ) Other, net 14.6 13.7 3.9 Total Other (income) expense, net $ 185.9 $ 69.2 $ 90.3 As noted in the preceding table, Other (income) expense, net in 2006 included a gain on the sale of the Company’s household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by increased restructuring charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program of $153.1. Investment losses (income) consisted of gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, principally due to declines and increases in the fair value of foreign denominated deposits which are economic hedges of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Other (income) expense, net in 2005 included a gain on the sale of heavy-duty laundry detergent businesses in North America and Southeast Asia, which was partially offset by charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and pension and other retiree benefits. The charges associated with certain pension and other retiree benefits were primarily a result of the conversion of one of the Company’s international pension plans to a defined contribution plan for all eligible participants and a lump sum payment of normal retirement benefits associated with a retirement plan in the U.S. as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits” (SFAS 88). 13 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Other (income) expense, net in 2004 included charges of $65.3 related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and a gain of $26.7 on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. Operating Profit In 2006, Operating profit decreased 2% to $2,160.5 as compared with an increase of 4% in 2005 to $2,215.0 from $2,122.1 in 2004. All years presented benefited from sales growth and cost-saving initiatives. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in restructuring charges of $212.6, lower gains on sale of non-core brands of $101.4 and incremental stock-based compensation expense of $69.8 recognized as a result of adopting SFAS 123R, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin. Gains on sale of non-core product lines of $46.5, $147.9 and $26.7 recognized in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were more than offset by restructuring charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program of $395.4, $182.8 and $68.7 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, Operating profit included $34.0 of charges related to the remeasurement of certain pension obligations in 2005 and $19.7 of business realignment cost in 2004. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring Activities” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $158.7 in 2006, compared with $136.0 in 2005 and $119.7 in 2004. Interest expense, net was higher in 2006 due to an increase in average interest rates to approximately 5.0% from approximately 4.0% in 2005. Higher interest rates and higher average debt levels primarily to finance the GABA acquisition resulted in increased interest expense in 2005. In 2004, low interest rates allowed the Company to lower interest expense despite increased debt levels resulting from the GABA acquisition. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 32.4% in 2006, versus 35.0% in 2005 and 33.7% in 2004. The 2006 effective tax rate was increased as a result of the lower effective tax rate on restructuring charges (80 bps) and decreased by a lower effective tax rate on the sale of the household bleach business in Canada (30 bps). The 2005 effective tax rate was impacted by $40.9 of income taxes (200 bps) for the incremental repatriation of $780 of foreign earnings related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) as well as the lower effective tax rate on charges incurred in connection with the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program (130 bps), which in total increased the reported effective tax rate by 330 bps. Both years benefited from the Company’s global tax planning strategies which are reflected principally in overseas earnings being taxed at lower rates. The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period will depend upon the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. The tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2006, 2005 and 2004 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 27.6%, 20.6% and 30.1%, respectively. Over its duration, charges associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are projected to generate tax benefits at a rate between 25% and 30%. For additional information regarding the Company’s income taxes refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Net Income Net income was $1,353.4 in 2006 or $2.46 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,351.4 in 2005 or $2.43 per share and $1,327.1 in 2004 or $2.33 per share. Net income in 2006 included $38.2 ($0.07 per share) of gains on the sale of the household bleach business in Canada which was more than offset by $286.3 ($0.52 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and $48.1 ($0.09 per share) of incremental stock-based compensation charges due to the adoption of SFAS 123R. In 2005, Net income was impacted by a net aftertax charge of $115.2 ($0.21 per share) resulting from restructuring charges, gains on sales of certain non-core brands, income tax expense for the incremental repatriation of foreign earnings related to the AJCA and certain pension charges. Net income in 2004 includes an aftertax charge of $48.0 ($0.09 per share) associated with the initial phase of the 2004 Restructuring Program. Segment Results Effective January 1, 2006, the Company modified the geographic reporting structure of its Oral, Personal and Home Care segment in order to address evolving markets and more closely align countries with similar consumer needs and retail trade structures. Management responsibility for Eastern European operations, including Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Belarus, was transferred to Greater Asia management and responsibility for operations in the South Pacific, including Australia, was transferred to European management. The financial information for 2005 and 2004 has been reclassified to conform to the new reporting structure. The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.

Operating profit in North America increased 1% in 2006 to $550.1, even after the negative profit impact of the 2005 detergent divestment and increased commercial investment. In 2005, Operating profit in North America increased 3% to $545.7 as increased sales were partially offset by declines in gross profit margin reflecting increased raw and packaging material costs. Latin America Net sales in Latin America increased 15.0% in 2006 to $3,019.5 as a result of 10.0% volume growth, 4.0% higher pricing and 1.0% positive impact of foreign exchange. Every country in the region contributed to the very strong volume gains, led by Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Central America, Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador. Growth was driven by strong sales of Colgate Total, Colgate Sensitive, Colgate Max Fresh and Colgate Anti-Cavity toothpastes and the recent launch of Colgate 360° manual toothbrush. In other categories, Palmolive Nutri-Milk and Protex Oats bar soaps, Lady Speed Stick Double Defense deodorant, Palmolive Hydra Natura ActiFirm and Extra Dry body lotions and Palmolive Naturals expanded line of hair care products contributed to gains in the region.

Strong volume gains were achieved in nearly every country in the region led by Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, India, the Gulf States, South Africa, and Russia and the rest of the countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Successful new products driving the oral care growth included Colgate Max Fresh, Colgate Sensitive Multi-Protection, Colgate Anti-Cavity and Darlie Tea Care Mint toothpastes, and Colgate 360° manual toothbrush. New products contributing to growth in other categories in the region included Palmolive Nutri-Milk bar soap, Palmolive Naturals shampoo and conditioner, Protex Deo 12 bar soap and shower gel, and Lady Speed Stick Aloe deodorant.

Pet Nutrition Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 10.0% in 2006 to $1,669.1 on volume gains of 6.0% and an increase in net selling prices of 4.5%, offset by a 0.5% negative impact of foreign exchange. Strong sales of Science Diet Lamb Meal & Rice Recipe Large Breed dog food, Science Diet Lamb Meal & Rice Recipe Small Bites dog food and Science Diet Indoor Cat food continued to drive growth in the U.S. specialty retail channel. In the U.S. veterinary channel, Prescription Diet j/d Canine, the relaunch of Prescription Diet d/d Canine and Feline foods and a new chicken variety for Prescription Diet Feline r/d and w/d foods contributed to growth. Internationally, growth was strong led by Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Italy, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Taiwan and Russia. New pet food products contributing to the international growth included Prescription Diet j/d Canine, Prescription Diet Feline Chunks in Gravy pouches and Science Plan Neutered Cat, a new 17 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) veterinary exclusive product. In 2005, Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 6.0% to $1,520.2, driven by volume growth of 4.0%, an increase in net selling prices of 1.5% and positive foreign exchange of 0.5%. Operating profit grew 9% in 2006 to $447.9 due to increased sales, partially offset by higher advertising spending. Operating profit in Pet Nutrition grew 6% to $412.8 in 2005 as a result of increased sales and gross profit margins, partially offset by higher advertising and increased shipping and handling costs. Corporate Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($670.3), ($306.8) and ($274.5) for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Corporate operations include research and development costs, unallocated overhead costs, stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock awards, restructuring and related implementation costs, and gains and losses on sales of non-core brands and assets. The components of Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment are presented below: 2006 2005 2004 Gains on sales of non-core product lines, net $ 46.5 $ 147.9 $ 26.7 2004 Restructuring Program (395.4 ) (182.8 ) (68.7 ) Pension and other retiree benefits — (24.8 ) — Adoption impact of SFAS 123R (69.8 ) — — Unallocated overhead cost and other, net (251.6 ) (247.1 ) (232.5 ) Total Corporate Operating profit (loss) $ (670.3 ) $ (306.8 ) $ (274.5 ) The increase in Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily driven by restructuring charges and incremental stock-based compensation, offset by lower gains on the sale of certain non-core brands. In 2005, Corporate operating expenses increased due to restructuring charges and the remeasurement of certain pension obligations as required by SFAS 88, offset by gains on the sale of heavy-duty laundry detergent brands in North America and Southeast Asia. Restructuring Activities 2004 Restructuring Program In December 2004, the Company commenced a four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of this program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one-third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and also plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions. Business-building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets, and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The 2004 Restructuring Program is expected to result in approximately a 12% workforce reduction. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325 and $400 ($250 and $300 aftertax) annually by 2008. Over the course of the four-year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50%-60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. The estimated cost in 2007 is between $175 and $250 ($125 and $175 aftertax). While the Company believes the overall program will be completed within existing estimates, charges and savings may vary in a given year. 18 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) During 2004, in connection with the initial phase of the program, the Company announced the closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Greater Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa. During 2005, the Company commenced additional projects, the more significant of which related to changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. These changes will allow the Company to more cost effectively manufacture toothpaste, taking advantage of state-of-the-art technologies, and obtain cost-savings through the transfer of bar soap manufacturing to an established U.S. third party. The Company plans to consolidate toothpaste production in Europe, which is currently located at five company sites, into a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Poland. Upon completion of the consolidation project within the next year, toothpaste manufacturing is expected to cease at the Company’s facilities in Salford, United Kingdom; Anzio, Italy; Brasov, Romania; Gebze, Turkey; and Halinow, Poland. Other manufacturing activities will continue at these sites, except the Salford facility, which is expected to be closed. In North America, the Company plans to phase down production at its Jeffersonville, Indiana plant with all production expected to cease by January 2008. The plan calls for transferring production of the Company’s market leading Colgate Total toothpaste to a new state-of-the-art facility to be built in Morristown, Tennessee, and the relocation of other production and administrative services currently performed at Jeffersonville to other facilities. The Company’s Kansas City, Kansas facility, formally the site of U.S. bar soap production, was closed in late 2006 and all production was transitioned to an established U.S. third-party manufacturer. In 2006, the Company continued with the implementation of previously announced projects, most notably the changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. In addition, the Company implemented several new projects including a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, enabling the Company to continue to re-align organizational resources consistent with its business-building goals. Also consistent with it global manufacturing strategy, the Company initiated the closure of its toothbrush facility in Puerto Rico. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 restructuring and implementation related charges are reflected in the following income statement categories: 2006 2005 2004 Cost of sales $ 196.2 $ 100.2 $ 3.4 Selling, general and administrative expense 46.1 1.8 — Other (income) expense, net 153.1 80.8 65.3 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges pretax $ 395.4 $ 182.8 $ 68.7 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges aftertax $ 286.3 $ 145.1 $ 48.0 Restructuring charges, in the preceding table, are recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions are corporate-driven and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. Total 2006 charges relate to restructuring activities in North America (45%), Europe/South Pacific (19%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (7%), Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (24%). Total program-to-date accumulated charges relate to restructuring activities in North America (39%), Europe/South Pacific (32%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (7%), Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (17%). Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total charges of $646.9 ($479.4 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects. The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following significant projects: the voluntary early retirement program in the U.S.; the announced closing of the Jeffersonville, Indiana oral care facility; the 19 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; and exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Canada and Kansas City, Kansas. The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring charges discussed above and related accrual: Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Charges $ 41.6 $ 3.3 $ 22.0 $ 1.8 $ 68.7 Cash payments (1.4 ) — — (1.4 ) (2.8 ) Charges against assets — (3.3 ) (22.0 ) — (25.3 ) Foreign exchange 1.5 — — — 1.5 Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 41.7 $ — $ — $ 0.4 $ 42.1 Charges 58.6 65.3 30.2 28.7 182.8 Cash payments (47.8 ) — — (23.4 ) (71.2 ) Charges against assets (11.4 ) (65.3 ) (30.2 ) (6.4 ) (113.3 ) Other (1.4 ) — — 4.2 2.8 Foreign exchange (4.4 ) — — (0.1 ) (4.5 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 35.3 $ — $ — $ 3.4 $ 38.7 Charges 212.7 91.5 6.6 84.6 395.4 Cash payments (89.7 ) — — (75.3 ) (165.0 ) Charges against assets (98.4 ) (91.5 ) (6.6 ) (6.7 ) (203.2 ) Other (10.0 ) — — 5.2 (4.8 ) Foreign exchange 3.5 — — 0.1 3.6 Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 53.4 $ — $ — $ 11.3 $ 64.7 Termination benefits are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements of $108.4 and $12.8 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are reflected as Charges against assets and Other charges within Termination Benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets and an increase to other retiree benefit liabilities, respectively. During 2006 the Company made an $85.0 voluntary contribution to partially fund this obligation. The Company anticipates that it will make incremental cash contributions to its plans in order to fund these pension obligations over the duration of the 2004 Restructuring Program. Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company expects cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including dividends, capital expenditures, planned stock repurchases and restructuring payments). The Company’s strong cash-generating capability and financial condition also allow it to access financial markets worldwide. 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations in 2006 was $1,821.5 as compared with $1,784.4 in 2005 and $1,754.3 in 2004. The increase in 2006 reflects the Company’s improved profitability partially offset by changes in working capital, higher tax payments and increased spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of sales increased to 2.3% of sales in 2006 as compared with 1.7% of sales in 2005. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company’s working capital changes were driven in part by increased inventory levels, higher accounts receivable balances and higher tax payments, offset by higher levels of payables and accruals. Inventory days coverage ratio increased to 69 in 2006 as compared to 61 in 2005, largely as a result of efforts to ensure continued product supply during factory closings related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Higher balances in accounts receivables were due primarily to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a slight increase in days sales outstanding over the prior year, partly due to timing. Higher tax payments were the result of improved profitability as well as the timing of payments. A portion of tax payments for calendar year 2005 were made in 2006, including tax payments of approximately $20 relating to the sale of the Company’s Southeast Asian detergent brands in the fourth quarter of 2005. Investing activities used $620.4 of cash during 2006 compared with uses of $220.7 and $1,090.4 during 2005 and 2004, respectively. The change over 2005 is primarily due to higher payments in 2006 associated with acquisitions versus higher proceeds in 2005 associated with divestitures, along with increased capital spending in 2006. In 2006, the Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Tom’s of Maine, Inc. for approximately $100 plus transaction costs. Additionally, the Company increased its ownership interests in its Poland and Romania subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of approximately $95. In 2005, the Company increased its ownership interests in certain subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of $38.5, primarily related to its Malaysia subsidiary. In 2004, payments for acquisitions pertained to the purchase of 100% of the outstanding shares of GABA. Consistent with the Company’s strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, investing activities include proceeds from the sale of certain non-core product lines. Investing activities reflect $55.0 of proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Canadian bleach brands in 2006 and $215.6 of proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Southeast Asian and North American heavy-duty detergent brands in 2005. Investing activities for 2004 include the Company’s sale of certain non-core detergent brands in Latin America for an aggregate sales price of $37.0. Capital expenditures were $476.4, $389.2 and $348.1 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital spending is trending upwards as a result of the Company’s multi-year restructuring and business-building program and continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2007 are expected to increase to a rate of approximately 5% of Net sales. Financing activities used $1,059.0 of cash during 2006 compared to $1,524.4 and $611.1 during 2005 and 2004, respectively. Financing activities in 2006 reflect higher proceeds from exercise of stock options, which more than offset an increase in common and preference stock dividend payments as well as higher share repurchases associated with the share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors in 2006 and 2004. Additionally, debt increased $139.1, net of payments, in 2006 versus a decrease of $78.4, net of proceeds, in 2005. In 2005, financing activities reflect a cash payment of $89.7 to an outside investor as a result of the discontinuation of a financing subsidiary of the Company. The Company previously had a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors, the purpose of which was to purchase some of the Company’s receivables thereby 21 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) giving the Company access to additional sources of capital. The subsidiary, including such receivables, was consolidated and the amounts invested by outside investors were reported as a minority interest. Dividend payments in 2006 were $677.8, up from $607.2 in 2005 and $536.2 in 2004. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.25 per share in 2006 from $1.11 per share in 2005 and $0.96 per share in 2004. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments increased to $10.00 per share in 2006 from $8.88 per share in 2005 and $7.68 per share in 2004. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from cash provided by operations. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill the requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock through December 31, 2005 (the 2004 Program) and, in December 2005, the Board of Directors extended this authorization through March 31, 2006. The Company completed this program in the first quarter of 2006. In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the 2006 Program), under which the Company may purchase up to 30 million common shares. Aggregate repurchases in 2006, including repurchases under the 2004 and 2006 Programs as well as other Board authorizations, were 15.0 million common shares for a total purchase price of $884.7. Aggregate repurchases for 2005 were 15.1 million common shares for a total purchase price of $796.2. Aggregate repurchases for 2004 were 12.4 million common shares for a total purchase price of $637.9. Long-term debt increased to $3,497.1 as of December 31, 2006 as compared to $3,274.7 as of December 31, 2005 and total debt increased to $3,671.2 as of December 31, 2006 as compared to $3,446.2 as of December 31, 2005. The Company’s long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. During 2005, the Company issued 250 million of Swiss franc-denominated five-year bonds (approximately $205 at the December 31, 2006 exchange rate) at a fixed rate of 1.9%. Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $651.6 and $621.8 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2006 and 2005 was $1,400 and $1,715, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor’s rating of A-1+ and a Moody’s Investors Service rating of P-1. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable totaling $674.0 and $641.9, respectively, are classified as long-term debt, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2011. At December 31, 2006, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of approximately $2,500 and also had $1,417.2 of medium-term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Company’s domestic lines of credit include a five-year revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 which was extended an additional year in the fourth quarter of 2006 and now expires in November 2011. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain credit facilities contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. 22 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Total Payments Due by Period 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion(1) $ 3,463.8 $ 1,424.5 $ 163.0 $ 231.2 $ 295.4 $ 25.5 $ 1,324.2 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2) 1,615.9 210.9 107.4 95.6 85.5 75.8 1,040.7 Capitalized leases 33.3 26.2 1.1 1.1 1.0 1.0 2.9 Operating leases 529.8 117.0 104.1 87.7 66.7 51.2 103.1 Purchase obligations(3) 864.0 568.8 246.6 38.7 9.6 0.3 — Total(4) $ 6,506.8 $ 2,347.4 $ 622.2 $ 454.3 $ 458.2 $ 153.8 $ 2,470.9 (1) Long-term debt due in 2007 includes $674.0 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2006, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit that expire in 2011. (2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. (3) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2006 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. (4) Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2008. Management’s best estimate of cash required to be paid directly from the Company’s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2007 is approximately $57. In addition, the Company currently plans to make approximately $50 of voluntary contributions to the U.S. pension plans. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by the one-time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or ongoing results of operations and cash flows. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. 23 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company’s major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in Europe and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. In 2006, the results of the Company’s commodity hedging activities were not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long-term debt rating of AA-/Aa3 or higher. Value at Risk The Company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2006 and 2005. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the 24 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Company’s results of operations in 2006 and 2005. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48), which prescribes accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and the measurement of tax benefits recognized. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of the Company’s 2007 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is currently finalizing its analysis of the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of adopting FIN 48 and believes that the impact, if any, will not be material. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories. • Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 770 bps from 54.8% to 47.1% in 2006 and decreased by 750 bps and 720 bps in 2005 and 2004, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings. • The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (approximately 80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (approximately 20% of inventories). There would have been no impact on reported earnings for 2006, 2005 and 2004 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. • In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. plans was 5.80%, 5.50% and 5.75% as of 25 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return. The historical rate of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15-year period was 9%. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 33% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term), 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 9.25% in the long-term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would cumulatively impact future Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. (Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.) • The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 10% for 2007, declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $4. • Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards under SFAS 123R. The weighted average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $10.30. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs however, could result in significant changes in fair value. A one year change in term would result in a 15% change in fair value. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by 4%. • Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable value. • Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. • Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially 26 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) affected by the one-time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or ongoing results of operations and cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.) Outlook Looking forward into 2007, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, it believes it is well positioned for continued growth. It anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share. The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company is in the process of streamlining its global supply chain, reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Company’s other ongoing cost-savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. However, as noted above, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic and political uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of Latin American and European currencies may impact the overall results of these regions. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Over the long-term, the Company’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hill’s also competes on a worldwide basis, selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. On an on-going basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Company’s corporate governance practices (including the Company’s Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained. To achieve its financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive growth and to fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, in particular by deploying valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. Growth opportunities are enhanced in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. Consistent with the Company’s strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company announced its agreement to sell its household bleach businesses in Latin America and Canada. The transaction closed in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2006. In the Latin American countries, the transaction closed during the first quarter of 2007 with the exception of Colombia, where the transaction did not receive regulatory approval and the parties have agreed not to proceed with the sale. Also consistent with this strategy the Company divested its North American and Southeast Asian heavy-duty laundry detergent brands during 2005. 13 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Tom’s of Maine, Inc. in 2006. This acquisition allowed the Company to enter the fast-growing health and specialty trade channel in the U.S. where Tom’s of Maine toothpaste and deodorants are market leaders. The Company’s previously announced four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses is progressing on schedule. On April 24, 2007, the Company expanded the 2004 Restructuring Program to encompass additional savings projects identified by the Company during the course of implementing the program. These additional projects will not extend the length of the program beyond the anticipated completion date of December 31, 2008. Including the expansion, the cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all the projects are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,000 and $1,075 ($725 and $775 aftertax). Once all projects are implemented, savings are projected to be in the range of $425 and $475 ($325 and $350 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which is expected to increase future cash flows. Looking forward into 2008, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, the Company believes it is well positioned for continued growth. As further explained in the “Outlook” section of Part II, Item 7, of this report, over the long-term, the Company’s continued focus on its consumer products business, the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide Net sales were $13,789.7 in 2007, up 12.5% from 2006 driven by volume growth of 6.5%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.0%. The divestments of the Latin American and Canadian household bleach businesses in 2007 and 2006, respectively, reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2007, by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2006. Excluding the impact of these divestments, sales increased 13.0% in 2007 on volume growth of 7.0%. Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $11,930.6 in 2007, up 13.0% from 2006 driven by volume growth of 7.0%, net selling price increases of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.5%. The divestments of the Latin American and Canadian household bleach businesses reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2007, by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2006. Excluding the impact of these divestments, sales increased 13.5% in 2007 on volume growth of 7.5%. Net sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition were $1,859.1 in 2007, up 11.5% from 2006 driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 5.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%. In 2006, worldwide Net sales were $12,237.7, up 7.5% from 2005 driven by volume growth of 5.5%, an increase in net selling prices of 1.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 0.5%. The 2005 divestment of the Company’s heavy-duty laundry detergent business in North America and Southeast Asia reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2006, by 1.5% versus the comparable period of 2005. Excluding the impact of the 2005 divestments, sales increased 9.0% in 2006 on volume growth of 7.0%. Gross Profit Worldwide gross profit margin was 56.2% in 2007, 54.8% in 2006 and 54.4% in 2005. In 2007, Gross profit benefited from a continued focus on cost-savings programs, lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program and the shift toward higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) packaging material costs. The increase in gross profit margin in 2006 from 2005 was driven by the benefits from higher pricing, a continued focus on cost-savings programs and a shift towards higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs and increased charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Restructuring and related implementation charges incurred under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $153.8, $196.2 and $100.2, respectively. These charges included ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing manufacturing facilities, start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities, accelerated depreciation and certain employee termination benefits. The 2004 Restructuring Program lowered the reported gross profit margin by 110 basis points (bps), 160 bps and 90 bps in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, gross profit margin increased to 57.3% in 2007 as compared to 56.4% in 2006 and 55.3% in 2005. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 36.1% in 2007, 35.6% in 2006 and 34.4% in 2005. The 50 bps increase in 2007 was driven primarily by increased advertising (40 bps) and an increase in shipping and handling costs. Advertising increased 17% to $1,545.7 as compared to 2006, on top of an 11% increase in the year-ago period. During 2007, the increase in gross profit margin and other savings programs funded an increase in advertising, supporting new product launches and helping increase market shares throughout the world. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2006 increased by a net 120 bps as compared to 2005, primarily due to increased advertising (30 bps), charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program (40 bps) and incremental stock-based compensation expense recognized as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R) (60 bps). Selling, general and administrative expenses include charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $49.1 in 2007, $46.1 in 2006 and $1.8 in 2005. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $121.3, $185.9 and $69.2 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2007 2006 2005 Minority interest $ 67.1 $ 57.5 $ 55.3 Amortization of intangible assets 18.2 16.3 15.6 Equity (income) (3.7 ) (3.4 ) (2.0 ) Gains on sales of non-core product lines, net (48.6 ) (46.5 ) (147.9 ) 2004 Restructuring Program 55.6 153.1 80.8 Hill’s limited voluntary recall 12.6 — — Pension and other retiree benefits SFAS 88 charges 15.4 — 34.0 Investment losses (income) (1.5 ) (5.7 ) 19.7 Other, net 6.2 14.6 13.7 Total Other (income) expense, net $ 121.3 $ 185.9 $ 69.2 As noted in the preceding table, Other (income) expense, net in 2007 included a gain on the sale of the Company’s household bleach business in Latin America, which was offset by charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products (see the 15 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) “Segment Results” section, below, for further information regarding the voluntary recall) and pension and other retiree benefits. The charges associated with pension and other retiree benefits were primarily a result of lump sum payments of normal retirement benefits associated with a nonqualified retirement plan in the U.S. as required by SFAS No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Termination Benefits” (SFAS 88 charges). Other (income) expense, net in 2006 included a gain on the sale of the Company’s household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program. Other (income) expense, net in 2005 included a gain on the sale of heavy-duty laundry detergent businesses in North America and Southeast Asia, which was partially offset by charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and pension and other retiree benefits. The charges associated with pension and other retiree benefits were primarily a result of the conversion of one of the Company’s international pension plans to a defined contribution plan for all eligible participants and a lump sum payment of normal retirement benefits associated with a retirement plan in the U.S. as required by SFAS 88. Investment losses (income) consisted of gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, principally due to declines and increases in the fair value of foreign-denominated deposits, which are economic hedges of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Operating Profit In 2007, Operating profit increased 23% to $2,653.1 as compared to $2,160.5 in 2006 and decreased 2% in 2006 as compared to $2,215.0 in 2005. All years presented benefited from sales growth and cost-saving initiatives. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to a higher gross profit margin and a decrease in charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $136.9. These items were partially offset by higher advertising, the negative impact of SFAS 88 charges and the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products. In 2006, Operating profit decreased 2% to $2,160.5 as compared to $2,215.0 in 2005, primarily due to an increase in charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $212.6, lower gains on sale of non-core product lines of $101.4 and incremental stock-based compensation expense of $69.8 recognized as a result of adopting SFAS 123R, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin. Operating profit in 2005 included $34.0 of charges related to the re-measurement of certain pension obligations; there was no comparable amount in 2006. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $156.6 in 2007 compared with $158.7 in 2006 and $136.0 in 2005. The increase in Interest expense, net from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher average interest rates in 2006. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 30.4% in 2007, 32.4% in 2006 and 35.0% in 2005. The tax rate in all years was impacted by the benefits of global tax planning strategies, the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, gains on asset sales and other one-time items. The 2007 effective tax rate of 30.4% reflects a 300 bps reduction from the recognition of $73.9 of tax benefits as a result of the reduction of a tax loss carryforward valuation allowance in Brazil of $94.6 that was partially offset by tax provisions for the recapitalization of certain overseas subsidiaries and an increase of 40 bps from the impact of the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and 10 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America. The 2006 effective income tax rate of 32.4% reflects an 80 bps increase from the impact of the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and a decrease of 30 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Canada. Also increasing the 2007 effective rate is the cost associated with higher remittances from overseas subsidiaries and the one-time impact of statutory tax rate changes in certain overseas subsidiaries. 16 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period will depend upon the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. The tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2007, 2006 and 2005 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 28.9%, 27.6% and 20.6%, respectively. Over its duration, charges associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are projected to generate tax benefits at a rate between 25% and 30%. For additional information regarding the Company’s income taxes, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income Net income was $1,737.4 in 2007 or $3.20 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,353.4 in 2006 or $2.46 per share and $1,351.4 in 2005 or $2.43 per share. Net income in 2007 included a $29.7 ($0.05 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America and an income tax benefit of $73.9 ($0.14 per share) related to the tax items noted above. Such benefits were more than offset by $183.7 ($0.34 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, $10.0 ($0.02 per share) of SFAS 88 charges and $8.2 ($0.01 per share) of charges related to the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products. Net income in 2006 included a $38.2 ($0.07 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by $286.3 ($0.52 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and $48.1 ($0.09 per share) of incremental stock-based compensation charges due to the adoption of SFAS 123R as compared to 2005. In 2005, Net income was impacted by a net aftertax charge of $115.2 ($0.21 per share) related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, gains on sales of certain non-core product lines, income tax expense for the incremental repatriation of foreign earnings related to The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) and certain pension charges. Segment Results The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.

Sales growth within the U.S. specialty pet channel was driven by Science Diet Adult Large Breed Canine, Science Diet Lamb Meal & Rice Adult Small Bites Canine and Science Diet Nature’s Best Canine with upgraded all natural ingredients. Science Diet Indoor Cat and Science Diet Light contributed to growth in feline products. Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Feline, Prescription Diet j/d Canine and new Prescription Diet Hypoallergenic Treats for dogs and cats contributed to growth in the U.S. veterinary channel. Internationally, growth was led by South Africa, the Nordic region, Australia, Spain and Russia. New pet food products contributing to the international growth include Prescription Diet j/d Light Canine, Science Plan Chunks in Gravy Feline pouches and Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Feline. In 2006, Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 10.0% to $1,669.1 on volume gains of 6.0% and an increase in net selling prices of 4.5%, offset by a 0.5% negative impact of foreign exchange. Like most major North American pet food producers, Hill’s Pet Nutrition was affected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s pet food recall in March 2007. Hill’s took the precaution of conducting a voluntary recall of a small number of its products that may have been affected. These products accounted for less than 0.5% of Hill’s Pet Nutrition’s annual Net sales. The related sales loss did not have a significant impact on the Company’s 2007 annual Net sales or Operating profit. Hill’s Pet Nutrition’s Operating profit for 2007 does not reflect the impact of the recall as these costs have been included in the Corporate segment. Operating profit increased 9% to $487.8 in 2007 due to increased sales offset by higher agricultural commodities costs. In 2006, Operating profit grew 9% to $447.9 due to increased sales, partially offset by higher advertising. Corporate Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($634.1), ($670.3) and ($306.8) for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Corporate operations include research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock awards, restructuring and related implementation costs, gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets and certain SFAS 88 charges. The components of Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment are presented below: 2007 2006 2005 Gains on sales of non-core product lines, net $ 48.6 $ 46.5 $ 147.9 2004 Restructuring Program (258.5 ) (395.4 ) (182.8 ) Pension and other retiree benefits SFAS 88 charges (15.4 ) — (24.8 ) Hill’s limited voluntary recall (13.6 ) — — Corporate overhead cost and other, net (395.2 ) (321.4 ) (247.1 ) Total Corporate Operating profit (loss) $ (634.1 ) $ (670.3 ) $ (306.8 ) Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2007 decreased as compared to 2006, primarily due to lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, offset by higher costs resulting from supply chain globalization initiatives implemented under the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and increases in research and development costs and other new product initiatives. In addition, 2007 includes the negative impact of SFAS 88 charges and the negative impact of the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products. The increase in Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily driven by higher restructuring charges and incremental stock-based compensation of $69.8 recognized as a result of adopting SFAS 123R and lower gains on the sale of certain non-core product lines. In 2005, Corporate Operating profit (loss) included the remeasurement of certain pension obligations as required by SFAS 88. 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Corporate Operating profit (loss) includes charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $258.5 in 2007, $395.4 in 2006 and $182.8 in 2005. Charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program were higher in 2006 as a result of the charges related to the voluntary early retirement program applicable to certain U.S. employees, which was implemented in 2006. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges,” below, and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net sales and volume growth both worldwide and in relevant geographic divisions are discussed in this Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors as they allow comparisons of Net sales and volume growth from on-going operations. Worldwide Gross profit margin is discussed in this Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of restructuring charges (non-GAAP). Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the Company’s on-going operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. While the Company believes that this financial measure is useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges 2004 Restructuring Program The Company’s previously announced four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses is progressing on schedule. As part of this program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one-third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions. Business-building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. On April 24, 2007, the Company expanded the 2004 Restructuring Program to encompass additional savings projects identified by the Company during the course of implementing the program. These additional projects will not extend the length of the program beyond the anticipated completion date of December 31, 2008. Including the expansion, the cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all the projects are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,000 and $1,075 ($725 and $775 aftertax). It is estimated that the total cumulative pretax charges of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program, once completed, will be comprised of the following: termination benefits (40%), incremental depreciation (20%), asset impairments (5%) and other charges consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (15%). Over the course of the four-year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50%-60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. The estimated cost in 2008 is between $95 and $170 ($70 and $125 aftertax). Once all projects are implemented, savings are projected to be in the range of $425 and $475 ($325 and $350 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which is expected to increase future cash flows. During 2004, in connection with the initial phase of the program, the Company announced the closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Greater Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/ 21 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Africa. During 2005, the Company commenced additional projects, the more significant of which related to changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. These changes will allow the Company to manufacture toothpaste more cost effectively, by taking advantage of state-of-the-art technologies. The Company is in the process of consolidating toothpaste production in Europe, which is currently located at five company sites, into a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Poland. Upon completion of the consolidation project within 2008, toothpaste manufacturing is expected to cease at the Company’s facilities in Salford, United Kingdom; Brasov, Romania and Gebze, Turkey. Toothpaste manufacturing has already ceased at Anzio, Italy. Other manufacturing activities will continue at these sites, except the Salford facility, which is expected to be closed. In North America, the Company ceased production at its Jeffersonville, Indiana, plant in December 2007 and transferred production of the Company’s market-leading Colgate Total toothpaste to a new state-of-the-art facility in Morristown, Tennessee, and relocated other production and administrative services performed at Jeffersonville to other facilities. The Company’s Kansas City, Kansas facility, formerly the site of U.S. bar soap production, was closed in late 2006 and all production was transitioned to a U.S. third-party manufacturer. In 2006, the Company continued with the implementation of previously announced projects, most notably the changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. In addition, the Company implemented several other projects, including a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, enabling the Company to continue to re-align organizational resources consistent with its business-building goals. Also consistent with its global manufacturing strategy, the Company initiated the closure of its toothbrush facility in Puerto Rico. During 2007, the Company continued to exit certain manufacturing activities and to re-align organizational resources in various locations throughout the world consistent with its business-building goals. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the income statement as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Cost of sales $ 153.8 $ 196.2 $ 100.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 49.1 46.1 1.8 Other (income) expense, net 55.6 153.1 80.8 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 258.5 $ 395.4 $ 182.8 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, aftertax $ 183.7 $ 286.3 $ 145.1 Restructuring charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. 22 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Total 2007 charges relate to the 2004 Restructuring Program in North America (36%), Europe/South Pacific (22%), Latin America (3%), Greater Asia/Africa (14%) and Corporate (25%). Total program-to-date accumulated charges relate to the 2004 Restructuring Program in North America (38%), Europe/South Pacific (29%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (9%) and Corporate (20%). Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total pretax cumulative charges of $905.4 ($663.1 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows: Cumulative Chargesas of December 31, 2007 Termination Benefits $ 393.8 Incremental Depreciation 201.5 Asset Impairments 59.1 Other 251.0 Total cumulative 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 905.4 The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following significant projects: the voluntary early retirement program in the U.S.; the closing of the Jeffersonville, Indiana, oral care facility; the consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Denmark, Puerto Rico, Senegal and Kansas City, Kansas; and the realignment of sales, administrative and research and development functions in various locations around the world. The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring charges discussed above and related accrual: TerminationBenefits IncrementalDepreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 41.7 $ — $ — $ 0.4 $ 42.1 Charges 58.6 65.3 30.2 28.7 182.8 Cash payments (47.8 ) — — (23.4 ) (71.2 ) Charges against assets (11.4 ) (65.3 ) (30.2 ) (6.4 ) (113.3 ) Other (1.4 ) — — 4.2 2.8 Foreign exchange (4.4 ) — — (0.1 ) (4.5 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 35.3 $ — $ — $ 3.4 $ 38.7 Charges 212.7 91.5 6.6 84.6 395.4 Cash payments (89.7 ) — — (75.3 ) (165.0 ) Charges against assets (98.4 ) (91.5 ) (6.6 ) (6.7 ) (203.2 ) Other (10.0 ) — — 5.2 (4.8 ) Foreign exchange 3.5 — — 0.1 3.6 Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 53.4 $ — $ — $ 11.3 $ 64.7 Charges 80.9 41.4 0.3 135.9 258.5 Cash payments (65.3 ) — — (137.4 ) (202.7 ) Charges against assets (14.1 ) (41.4 ) (0.3 ) (4.6 ) (60.4 ) Other (2.2 ) — — 3.6 1.4 Foreign exchange 1.9 — — 0.2 2.1 Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 54.6 $ — $ — $ 9.0 $ 63.6 23 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits also include pension enhancements of $14.1 and $98.4 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Termination benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets. In 2007 and 2006, Termination benefits also include $2.2 and $10.0, respectively, of charges related to other retiree benefit enhancements and are reflected in Other charges as an increase to other retiree benefit liabilities. In 2007 and 2006, the Company made voluntary contributions of $34.5 and $85.0, respectively, to partially fund this obligation. The Company anticipates that it will continue to make incremental cash contributions to its plans in order to fund its restructuring-related pension obligations over the duration of the 2004 Restructuring Program. Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets. Other charges primarily consist of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program. These charges include ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing facilities, start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2007 charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities were $33.2, and costs incurred for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were $37.9. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred $40.7 of charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities and $70.3 of costs for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. All costs relating to start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives are expensed as incurred. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company expects cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including dividends, capital expenditures, planned stock repurchases and restructuring payments). The Company’s strong cash-generating capability and financial condition also allow it broad access to financial markets worldwide. Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations in 2007 was $2,203.7 as compared with $1,821.5 in 2006 and $1,784.4 in 2005. The increase in 2007 reflects the Company’s improved profitability, decreased spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program and changes in working capital, offset by a decrease in net deferred income tax liabilities. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales improved to 2.2% in 2007 as compared with 2.3% in 2006. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company’s working capital changes were driven by higher levels of payables and accruals, primarily due to the timing of tax payments and higher advertising, offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances. Higher balances in accounts receivable were due primarily to higher Net sales in 2007. Days sales outstanding decreased slightly as compared to 2006. The inventory days coverage ratio increased to 73 in 2007 as compared to 69 in 2006 to ensure continued product supply during plant closings under the 2004 Restructuring Program. 24 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) With the progression of the 2004 Restructuring Program, pretax restructuring charges decreased $136.9, and cash spending decreased $12.8 in 2007 relative to the comparable period of 2006. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2007, will be paid out before year end 2008. It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2004 Restructuring Program will continue to be funded from operating cash flows. Investing activities used $528.3 of cash during 2007 compared with uses of $620.4 and $220.7 during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in uses as compared to 2006 is primarily due to lower payments for acquisitions and higher proceeds from the sale of property and non-core product lines, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. In 2007, the Company increased its ownership interest in one of its subsidiaries in China to 100% at a cost of $26.5. In 2006, the Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Tom’s of Maine, Inc., for approximately $100 plus transaction costs. Additionally, in 2006 the Company increased its ownership interests in its Poland and Romania subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of approximately $95. In 2005, the Company increased its ownership interests in certain subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of $38.5, primarily related to its Malaysia subsidiary. Consistent with the Company’s strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, investing activities include proceeds from the sale of certain non-core product lines. Investing activities in 2007 include $66.5 of net proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Latin American household bleach business and $43.2 of proceeds from the sale of other property related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Investing activities include $55.0 of proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Canadian household bleach business in 2006 and $215.6 of proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Southeast Asian and North American heavy-duty detergent brands in 2005. Capital expenditures were $583.1, $476.4 and $389.2 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital spending is trending upwards as a result of the Company’s multi-year restructuring and business-building program and continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2008 are expected to remain consistent at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales. Financing activities used $1,754.4 of cash during 2007 compared to $1,059.0 and $1,524.4 during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to higher purchases of treasury shares and a net reduction of debt. The decrease in 2006 was primarily related to proceeds from exercise of stock options and proceeds from debt. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock through December 31, 2005 (the 2004 Program) and, in December 2005, the Board of Directors extended this authorization through March 31, 2006. The Company completed this program in the first quarter of 2006. In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the 2006 Program) under which the Company may purchase up to 30 million common shares. On January 30, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the 2008 Program) that replaces the 2006 Program and authorizes the Company to purchase up to 30 million common shares. Aggregate repurchases in 2007 included 15.8 million common shares under the 2006 Program and 5.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans for a total purchase price of $1,269.4. Aggregate repurchases in 2006 included 14.0 million common shares under the 2004 and 2006 Programs and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans for a total purchase price of $884.7. Aggregate repurchases in 2005 included 14.0 million common shares under the 2004 Program and 1.1 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans for a total purchase price of $796.2. Dividend payments in 2007 were $749.6, up from $677.8 in 2006 and $607.2 in 2005. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.40 per share in 2007 from $1.25 per share in 2006 and $1.11 per share in 25 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2005. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments increased to $11.20 per share in 2007 from $10.00 per share in 2006 and $8.88 per share in 2005. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from cash provided by operations. In 2005, financing activities reflect a cash payment of $89.7 to an outside investor as a result of the discontinuation of a financing subsidiary of the Company. The Company previously had a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors, the purpose of which was to purchase some of the Company’s receivables and thereby give the Company access to additional sources of capital. The subsidiary, including such receivables, was consolidated and the amounts invested by outside investors were reported as a minority interest. Long-term debt decreased to $3,360.0 as of December 31, 2007 as compared to $3,497.1 as of December 31, 2006 and total debt decreased to $3,515.9 as of December 31, 2007 as compared to $3,671.2 as of December 31, 2006. The Company’s long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. During 2007, the Company issued 250 million of Euro-denominated medium term notes (approximately $365 at the December 31, 2007 exchange rate) maturing in June 2014, at a fixed interest rate of 4.75%, payable annually. The net proceeds of approximately $332 (248 million Euros) from the issuance were used to pay down U.S.-denominated commercial paper. During 2005, the Company issued 250 million of Swiss franc-denominated five-year bonds (approximately $221 at the December 31, 2007 exchange rate) at a fixed rate of 1.9%. Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $478.8 and $651.6 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2007 and 2006 was approximately $1,700 and $1,400, respectively. The average daily balance outstanding for U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper in 2007 and 2006 was $872.0 and $766.1, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor’s rating of A-1+ and a Moody’s Investors Service rating of P-1. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable totaling $478.8 and $674.0, respectively, were classified as long-term debt, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2012. At December 31, 2007, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,752.3 and also had $1,052.2 of medium-term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Company’s domestic lines of credit include a five-year revolving credit facility of $1,500.0, which was extended an additional year in the fourth quarter of 2007 and now expires in November 2012. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance. The long-term notes of the Company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that are guaranteed by the Company and certain amounts payable to banks contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. 26 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Total Payments Due by Period 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion(1) $ 3,352.4 $ 615.8 $ 99.6 $ 311.0 $ 621.1 $ 333.2 $ 1,371.7 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2) 1,619.6 202.6 136.4 128.3 119.8 79.2 953.3 Capitalized leases 7.6 1.1 1.2 1.1 1.1 1.1 2.0 Operating leases 590.4 134.9 117.3 88.4 68.3 66.2 115.3 Purchase obligations(3) 763.4 400.7 198.2 105.4 26.8 17.3 15.0 Total(4) $ 6,333.4 $ 1,355.1 $ 552.7 $ 634.2 $ 837.1 $ 497.0 $ 2,457.3 (1) Long-term debt due in 2008 includes $478.8 of commercial paper that has been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2007, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit that expire in 2012. (2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. (3) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2007 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. (4) Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates,” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2015. Management’s best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Company’s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2008, is approximately $95, including approximately $16 for other retiree benefit plans. These estimated cash requirements include approximately $53 of projected contributions to the Company’s postretirement plans and approximately $42 of projected benefit payments made directly to participants of unfunded plans. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by the one-time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of 27 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company’s major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in Europe, Asia/Africa and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts and currency options with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans. Futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. In 2007, the results of the Company’s commodity hedging activities were not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long-term debt rating of AA-/Aa3 or higher. Value at Risk The Company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity-based financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate, foreign exchange rate or commodity-based instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2007 and 2006. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate, foreign exchange rate, or commodity-based instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Company’s results of operations in 2007 and 2006. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. 28 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) For information regarding the Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with certain requirements being effective in fiscal years beginning after 2008. The Company does not expect that SFAS 157 will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree, including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination. Certain forms of contingent consideration and certain acquired contingencies will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also states acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred, and restructuring costs will be expensed in periods after the acquisition date. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—An Amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income; changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 160 and does not expect it will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 29 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories. • Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 790 bps from 56.2% to 48.3% in 2007 and decreased 770 bps and 750 bps in 2006 and 2005, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings. • The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (approximately 80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (approximately 20% of inventories). There would have been no impact on reported earnings for 2007, 2006 and 2005 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairment, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies. • In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. plans was 6.50%, 5.80% and 5.50% as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return. The historical rate of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15-year period was 9%. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 33% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term), 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 9.25% in the long-term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would cumulatively impact future Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. (Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.) • The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 10% for 2008, declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $7. • Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R), using the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black- 30 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards under SFAS 123R. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $12.72. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 13%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 4%. • Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable value. • The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. • Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. • Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the one-time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.) Outlook Looking forward into 2008, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, it believes it is well positioned for continued growth. In order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share, the Company anticipates continuing to prioritize investments in key categories and markets and increasing momentum against its strategic initiatives: getting closer to the consumer, the profession and our customers; effectiveness and efficiency in everything; innovation everywhere; and leadership. The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company is in the process of streamlining its global supply chain, reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Company’s other on-going cost-savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. 31 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) However, as noted above, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic and political uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of Latin American and European currencies may impact the overall results of these regions. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Over the long-term, the Company’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. On an on-going basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Company’s corporate governance practices (including the Company’s Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained. To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. 13 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consistent with the Company’s strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company announced its agreement to sell its household bleach businesses in Latin America and Canada. The transaction closed in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2006. In the Latin American countries, the transaction closed during the first quarter of 2007 with the exception of Colombia, where the transaction did not receive regulatory approval. The Company’s previously announced 2004 Restructuring Program to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses was finalized as of December 31, 2008. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company has incurred total pretax cumulative charges of $1,069.2 ($775.5 aftertax). Savings are estimated to be in the range of $475 and $500 pretax ($350 and $375 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which will increase future cash flows. As a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program, we streamlined our global supply chain, reallocated resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing countries and other key markets, and consolidated these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with our other on-going cost-savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. As further explained in the “Outlook” section below, while we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging in 2009, we believe the Company is well-positioned to deliver increased shareholder value over the long-term. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide Net sales were $15,329.9 in 2008, up 11.0% from 2007, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 5.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.0%. The 2007 divestment of the Latin American household bleach business and the 2008 divestment of the Senegal fabric care business reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2007. Excluding the impact of these divestments, Net sales increased 11.5% in 2008 on volume growth of 4.0%. Organic sales (Net sales excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) grew 9.5% in 2008. Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $13,182.4 in 2008, up 10.5% from 2007, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 4.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%. Excluding the 0.5% impact of the above-described divestments, Net sales increased 11.0% in 2008 on volume growth of 4.0%. Organic sales grew 8.5% in 2008. Net sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition were $2,147.5 in 2008, up 15.5% from 2007, driven by volume growth of 2.5%, net selling price increases of 10.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%. Organic sales grew 13.0% in 2008. Worldwide Net sales were $13,789.7 in 2007, up 12.5% from 2006, driven by volume growth of 6.5%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.0%. The divestments of the Latin American and Canadian household bleach businesses in 2007 and 2006, respectively, reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2007 by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2006. Excluding the impact of these divestments, sales increased 13.0% in 2007 on volume growth of 7.0%. Organic sales grew 8.0% in 2007. 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Gross Profit Worldwide gross profit margin was 56.3% in 2008, 56.2% in 2007 and 54.8% in 2006. Restructuring and implementation-related charges incurred under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $58.8, $153.8 and $196.2, respectively. The 2004 Restructuring Program lowered the reported gross profit margin by 40 basis points (bps), 110 bps and 160 bps in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, gross profit margin was 56.7% in 2008, 57.3% in 2007 and 56.4% in 2006. On this basis, the decrease in 2008 was due to increases in raw and packaging material costs, partially offset by higher pricing and a continued focus on cost-savings programs. The increase in 2007 was due to cost-savings programs and the shift towards higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 35.4% in 2008, 36.1% in 2007 and 35.6% in 2006. Included in Selling, general and administrative expenses are charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $81.0 (0.5% of Net sales) in 2008, $49.1 (0.4% of Net sales) in 2007 and $46.1 (0.4% of Net sales) in 2006. The 70 bps decrease in 2008 was driven primarily by moderating levels of advertising investment (40 bps) and a continued focus on cost-savings programs. While advertising was lower as a percentage of Net sales, total advertising increased 7% to $1,649.5 as compared to 2007, on top of a 17% increase in the year-ago period. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2007 increased by a net 50 bps as compared to 2006, primarily due to increased levels of advertising (40 bps) and an increase in shipping and handling costs. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $183.4, $121.3 and $185.9 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2008 2007 2006 Minority interest $ 80.3 $ 67.1 $ 57.5 Amortization of intangible assets 18.8 18.2 16.3 Equity (income) (3.8 ) (3.7 ) (3.4 ) Gain on sales of non-core product lines, net — (48.6 ) (46.5 ) 2004 Restructuring Program 24.0 55.6 153.1 SFAS 88 pension charges — 15.4 — Hill’s limited voluntary recall — 12.6 — Legal and environmental matters 23.0 — 5.8 Investment losses (income) 25.1 (1.5 ) (5.7 ) Other, net 16.0 6.2 8.8 Total Other (income) expense, net $ 183.4 $ 121.3 $ 185.9 15 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Operating Profit In 2008, Operating profit increased 14% to $3,020.7 as compared to $2,653.1 in 2007 and increased 23% in 2007 as compared to $2,160.5 in 2006. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program and other items set forth below, Operating profit increased 10% in 2008 and 15% in 2007 as follows: 2008 2007 %Change 2006 %Change Operating profit, GAAP $ 3,020.7 $ 2,653.1 14 % $ 2,160.5 23 % 2004 Restructuring Program 163.8 258.5 395.4 Gain on sale of non-core product lines, net — (48.6 ) (46.5 ) SFAS 88 pension charges — 15.4 — Hill’s limited voluntary recall — 13.6 — Operating profit, non-GAAP $ 3,184.5 $ 2,892.0 10 % $ 2,509.4 15 % Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $95.6 in 2008 compared with $156.6 in 2007 and $158.7 in 2006. The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2007 to 2008 was due to lower average interest rates. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 33.1% in 2008, 30.4% in 2007 and 32.4% in 2006. The tax rate in all years benefited from global tax planning strategies and was increased (decreased) by the impact of the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and other discrete items as follows: 10 bps in 2008, (250 bps) in 2007 and 50 bps in 2006. The 2008 effective tax rate reflects the impact of the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program. The 2007 effective tax rate reflects a 300 bps reduction from the recognition of $73.9 of tax benefits as a result of the reduction of a tax loss carryforward valuation allowance in Brazil of $94.6 that was partially offset by tax provisions for the recapitalization of certain overseas subsidiaries and increases of 40 bps from the impact of the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and 10 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America. The 2006 effective tax rate reflects an increase of 80 bps from the impact of the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and a decrease of 30 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Canada. Further impacting the effective rate in 2007 as compared to 2006 was the cost associated with higher remittances from overseas subsidiaries and the one-time adjustment resulting from changes in statutory tax rates in certain overseas subsidiaries. The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period has depended on the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. The tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2008, 2007 and 2006 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 31.4%, 28.9% and 27.6%, respectively. For additional information regarding the Company’s income taxes, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 16 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Net Income Net income was $1,957.2, or $3.66 per share on a diluted basis, in 2008 compared with $1,737.4, or $3.20 per share, in 2007 and $1,353.4, or $2.46 per share, in 2006. Net income in 2008 included $112.4 ($0.21 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program. Net income in 2007 included a $29.7 ($0.05 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America and an income tax benefit of $73.9 ($0.14 per share) related to the tax items noted above. Such benefits were more than offset by $183.7 ($0.34 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, $10.0 ($0.02 per share) of SFAS 88 pension charges and $8.2 ($0.01 per share) of charges related to the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products. Net income in 2006 included a $38.2 ($0.07 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by $286.3 ($0.52 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program. Segment Results The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.

Organic sales grew 9.0% in 2007. 19 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Like most major North American pet food producers, Hill’s Pet Nutrition was affected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s pet food recall in March 2007. Hill’s took the precaution of conducting a voluntary recall of a small number of its products that may have been affected. These products accounted for less than 0.5% of Hill’s Pet Nutrition’s annual Net sales. The related sales loss did not have a significant impact on the Company’s 2007 annual Net sales or Operating profit. Hill’s Pet Nutrition’s Operating profit for 2007 does not reflect the impact of the recall as these costs have been included in the Corporate segment. Operating profit for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 11% to $541.8 in 2008 and increased 9% to $487.8 in 2007. In both years, the increased Operating profit is due to increased sales partially offset by higher agricultural commodities costs and higher advertising spending. Corporate Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($583.7), ($634.1) and ($670.3) for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Corporate operations include research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock awards, restructuring and related implementation costs, gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets, certain SFAS 88 charges and, in 2007, the impact on Operating profit of the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products. The components of Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment are presented below: 2008 2007 2006 Gain on sales of non-core product lines, net $ — $ 48.6 $ 46.5 2004 Restructuring Program (163.8 ) (258.5 ) (395.4 ) SFAS 88 pension charges — (15.4 ) — Hill’s limited voluntary recall — (13.6 ) — Corporate overhead cost and other, net (419.9 ) (395.2 ) (321.4 ) Total Corporate Operating profit (loss) $ (583.7 ) $ (634.1 ) $ (670.3 ) Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2008 decreased as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, partially offset by higher charges for legal and environmental costs and investment losses. Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2007 decreased as compared to 2006, primarily due to lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, offset by higher costs resulting from supply chain globalization initiatives implemented under the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and increases in research and development costs and other new product initiatives. In addition, 2007 includes the negative impact of SFAS 88 charges and the negative impact of the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products. For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges,” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Net sales and volume growth, both worldwide and in relevant geographic divisions, are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) investors as they allow comparisons of Net sales and volume growth from on-going operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trend by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestments. Worldwide Gross profit margin and Operating profit are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program and other items (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the Company’s on-going operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. The Company uses these financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges 2004 Restructuring Program The Company’s previously announced four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses was finalized as of December 31, 2008. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total pretax cumulative charges of $1,069.2 ($775.5 aftertax). As a result of the program, the Company successfully achieved its objective of streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one-third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities as well as centralization of its purchasing and other business support functions. Business-building initiatives included enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. Savings are estimated to be in the range of $475 and $500 ($350 and $375 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which will increase future cash flows. During 2004, in connection with the initial phase of the program, the Company announced the closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Greater Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa. During 2005, the Company commenced additional projects, the more significant of which related to changes implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. The Company consolidated toothpaste production in Europe, which was previously located at five company sites, into a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Poland. With the completion of the consolidation project in 2008, toothpaste manufacturing has ceased at the Company’s facilities in Salford, United Kingdom; Brasov, Romania; Gebze, Turkey and Anzio, Italy. Other manufacturing activities will continue at these sites, except the Salford facility, which was closed. In North America, the Company ceased production at its Jeffersonville, Indiana plant in December 2007 and transferred production of the Company’s market-leading Colgate Total toothpaste to a new state-of-the-art facility in Morristown, 21 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Tennessee, and relocated other production and administrative services performed at Jeffersonville to other facilities. The Company’s Kansas City, Kansas facility, formerly the site of U.S. bar soap production, was closed in late 2006 and all production was transitioned to a U.S. third-party manufacturer. In 2006, the Company implemented several other projects, including a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, enabling the Company to continue to re-align organizational resources consistent with its business-building goals. Also consistent with its global manufacturing strategy, the Company initiated the closure of its toothbrush facility in Puerto Rico. During 2007 and 2008, the Company continued to exit certain manufacturing activities and to re-align organizational resources in various locations throughout the world, consistent with its business-building goals. Charges incurred in connection with the implementation of various projects since inception were as follows: Cumulative Chargesas of December 31, 2008 Termination Benefits $ 426.3 Incremental Depreciation 221.6 Asset Impairments 46.7 Other 374.6 Total cumulative 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 1,069.2 Other charges primarily consisted of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program. These charges included ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing facilities, start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred $45.5 of charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities and $136.6 of costs for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following significant projects: the voluntary early retirement program in the U.S.; the closing of the Jeffersonville, Indiana oral care facility; the consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Denmark, Puerto Rico, Senegal and Kansas City, Kansas; and the realignment of sales, administrative and research and development functions in various locations around the world. Since inception, total charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program were as follows: North America (36%), Europe/South Pacific (28%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (10%), Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (21%). For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the income statement as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Cost of sales $ 58.8 $ 153.8 $ 196.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 81.0 49.1 46.1 Other (income) expense, net 24.0 55.6 153.1 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 163.8 $ 258.5 $ 395.4 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, aftertax $ 112.4 $ 183.7 $ 286.3 22 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Restructuring and implementation-related charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. For 2008, total charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program were as follows: North America (26%), Europe/South Pacific (19%), Latin America (1%), Greater Asia/Africa (18%), Pet Nutrition (8%) and Corporate (28%). The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and implementation-related charges discussed above and related accrual: TerminationBenefits IncrementalDepreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 35.3 $ — $ — $ 3.4 $ 38.7 Charges 212.7 91.5 6.6 84.6 395.4 Cash payments (89.7 ) — — (75.3 ) (165.0 ) Charges against assets (98.4 ) (91.5 ) (6.6 ) (6.7 ) (203.2 ) Other (10.0 ) — — 5.2 (4.8 ) Foreign exchange 3.5 — — 0.1 3.6 Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 53.4 $ — $ — $ 11.3 $ 64.7 Charges 80.9 41.4 0.3 135.9 258.5 Cash payments (65.3 ) — — (137.4 ) (202.7 ) Charges against assets (14.1 ) (41.4 ) (0.3 ) (4.6 ) (60.4 ) Other (2.2 ) — — 3.6 1.4 Foreign exchange 1.9 — — 0.2 2.1 Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 54.6 $ — $ — $ 9.0 $ 63.6 Charges 32.5 20.1 (12.4 ) 123.6 163.8 Cash payments (73.4 ) — — (122.0 ) (195.4 ) Charges against assets (3.0 ) (20.1 ) 12.4 21.2 10.5 Other (0.1 ) — — (7.0 ) (7.1 ) Foreign exchange 1.3 — — (4.0 ) (2.7 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 11.9 $ — $ — $ 20.8 $ 32.7 Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program were calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits also include pension enhancements amounting to $3.0 and $14.1 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Termination benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension liabilities. In 2008 and 2007, Termination benefits also include $0.1 and $2.2, respectively, of charges related to other retiree benefit enhancements and are reflected in Other charges as an increase to other retiree benefit liabilities. In 2008 and 2007, the Company made voluntary contributions of $18.8 and $34.5, respectively, to partially fund this obligation. Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that are taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Within Asset impairments, charges are net of gains realized on the sale of assets. 23 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) For the year ended December 31, 2008, Other charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities were $4.8, and costs incurred for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were $66.3. Start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives are expensed as incurred. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, planned stock repurchases and restructuring payments). The Company believes its strong cash-generating capability and financial condition should allow it broad access to financial markets worldwide. Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations in 2008 was $2,238.3 as compared with $2,203.7 in 2007 and $1,821.5 in 2006. The increase in 2008 reflects the Company’s improved profitability and lower spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, offset by increased working capital, higher tax payments and higher voluntary cash contributions to the Company’s U.S. postretirement benefit plans. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Higher balances in accounts receivable were due primarily to higher Net sales in 2008. Inventory and accounts payable and other accruals increased as a result of raw material cost increases and inventory build-up for new product launches and promotional activities. Both days sales outstanding and the inventory days coverage ratio decreased slightly as compared to 2007. Overall, the Company’s working capital increased to 2.5% of Net sales in 2008 as compared with 2.2% in 2007. With the finalization of the 2004 Restructuring Program, pretax restructuring charges decreased $94.7, and cash spending decreased $23.0 in 2008 relative to the comparable period of 2007. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2008 will be paid out before year end 2009. Investing activities used $613.4 of cash during 2008 compared with uses of $528.3 and $620.4 during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in use as compared to 2007 is primarily due to higher capital spending and lower proceeds from the sale of property and non-core product lines offset by lower payments for acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $683.5, $583.1 and $476.4 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Increases in capital spending have been primarily due to the 2004 Restructuring Program as well as capacity expansions. Capital spending continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2009 are expected to remain consistent at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales. In 2007, the Company increased its ownership interest in one of its subsidiaries in China to 100% at a cost of $26.5. In 2006, the Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Tom’s of Maine, Inc., for approximately $100 plus transaction costs. Additionally, in 2006 the Company increased its ownership interests in its Poland and Romania subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of approximately $95. Consistent with the Company’s strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, investing activities include proceeds from the sale of certain property and non-core product lines. Investing activities in 2008 include $57.5 of proceeds from the sale of certain assets, primarily related to the 2004 Restructuring 24 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Program. Investing activities in 2007 include $66.5 of net proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Latin American household bleach business and $43.2 of proceeds from the sale of other property related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Investing activities in 2006 include $55.0 of proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Canadian household bleach business. Financing activities used $1,465.9 of cash during 2008 compared to $1,754.4 and $1,059.0 during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to higher proceeds from issuance of debt and lower repurchases of common stock, offset by a decrease in exercises of stock options and an increase in principal payments on debt and dividends paid. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and a net reduction of debt. Long-term debt increased to $3,676.3 as of December 31, 2008 as compared to $3,360.0 as of December 31, 2007 and total debt increased to $3,783.5 as of December 31, 2008 as compared to $3,515.9 as of December 31, 2007. The Company’s long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. At December 31, 2008, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,641.9 and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In August 2008, the Company increased the borrowing capacity under its domestic revolving credit facility from $1,500 to $1,600 by adding two banks to the syndicate of banks participating in the revolving credit facility. The facility has an expiration date of November 2012. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support the issuance of commercial paper. In May 2008, the Company issued $250 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 4.2% under the shelf registration statement for the Company’s medium-term note program. The Company simultaneously entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of the notes to a variable rate based on LIBOR. In May 2008, the Company also issued approximately $75 of forty-year notes at a variable rate based on LIBOR, also under the shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay $100 of medium-term notes with an original maturity of May 2017 and to reduce commercial paper borrowings. During 2007, the Company issued 250 million of Euro-denominated medium-term notes maturing in June 2014 at a fixed interest rate of 4.75%, payable annually. The net proceeds of approximately $332 (248 million Euros) from the issuance were used to pay down U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper. Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $735.0 and $478.8 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2008 and 2007 were $1,283.8 and $1,151.1, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor’s rating of A-1+ and a Moody’s Investors Service rating of P-1. The Company regularly classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt as it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in 2012. At December 31, 2008 and 2007 such amounts were $735.0 and $478.8, respectively. While uncertainties in the financial markets so far have not significantly affected the Company’s access to credit due to its strong credit rating, future financing could become difficult or more expensive for the Company if market conditions further deteriorate. The long-term notes of the Company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that are guaranteed by the Company and certain bank borrowings contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. 25 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Dividend payments in 2008 were $825.2, up from $749.6 in 2007 and $677.8 in 2006. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.56 per share in 2008 from $1.40 per share in 2007 and $1.25 per share in 2006. The Series B Preference stock dividend payments increased to $12.48 per share in 2008 from $11.20 per share in 2007 and $10.00 per share in 2006. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from cash provided by operations. The Company repurchases its shares of common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On January 30, 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2008 Program) that replaced the Company’s previous share repurchase program, which had been approved in 2006. The 2008 Program authorizes the repurchase of up to 30 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Aggregate repurchases in 2008 included 13.8 million common shares under both the 2008 Program and the previous share repurchase program, and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,072.9. Aggregate repurchases in 2007 included 15.8 million common shares under the previous program and 5.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,269.4. Aggregate repurchases in 2006 included 14.0 million common shares under previous programs and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $884.7. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: Total Payments Due by Period 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion(1) $ 3,669.4 $ 824.8 $ 355.2 $ 595.5 $ 333.2 $ 277.6 $ 1,283.1 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(2) 1,054.6 127.5 119.5 114.3 73.0 59.9 560.4 Capitalized leases 6.9 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.3 0.8 Operating leases 1,328.9 172.6 152.1 132.5 122.4 114.0 635.3 Purchase obligations(3) 255.1 157.1 83.1 6.1 5.8 3.0 — Total(4) $ 6,314.9 $ 1,283.2 $ 711.1 $ 849.6 $ 535.6 $ 455.8 $ 2,479.6 (1) Long-term debt due in 2009 includes $735.0 of commercial paper that has been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2008, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused line of credit that expires in 2012. (2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. (3) The Company has outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2008 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. (4) Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies 26 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) and Use of Estimates,” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2011. Management’s best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Company’s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2009, is approximately $150, including approximately $30 for other retiree benefit plans. These estimated cash requirements include approximately $90 of projected contributions to the Company’s postretirement plans, most of which are voluntary contributions to our U.S. pension plans, as well as approximately $60 of projected benefit payments made directly to participants of unfunded plans. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company’s major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in Europe, Asia/Africa and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging in an effort to minimize the impact of foreign currency rate movements on earnings. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business as well as the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts and currency options. These contracts generally have durations no greater than 18 months and are valued using observable forward rates in commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the contracts. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the swaps. The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans. Futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. These contracts generally have durations no greater than 18 months and are valued using quoted commodity exchange prices. 27 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as it is the Company’s policy to contract with highly rated diversified counterparties. The Company’s consideration of nonperformance risk as it relates to financial instruments includes a review of available market information in addition to published debt ratings, such as probability of default ratings and credit default swap spreads. Value at Risk The Company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity-based financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate, foreign exchange rate or commodity-based instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2008 and 2007. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate, foreign exchange rate, or commodity-based instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations in 2008 and 2007. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133), and requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for the Company’s financial statements as of January 1, 2009 and will not have any impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157), for one year for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Based on this guidance, the Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 as they relate to long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangibles, effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of these provisions will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. 28 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree, including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination. Certain forms of contingent consideration and certain acquired contingencies will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also states acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred and restructuring costs will be expensed in periods after the acquisition date. The Company will apply SFAS 141R prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—An Amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income; changes in ownership interest be accounted for as equity transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 160 will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories. • Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 780 bps from 56.3% to 48.5% in 2008 and decreased 790 bps and 770 bps in 2007 and 2006, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings. • The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (approximately 80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (approximately 20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2008, 2007 and 2006 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. 29 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairment, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies. • In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans was 6.30%, 6.50% and 5.80% as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The discount rate for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.80%, 6.50% and 5.80% as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return. The historical rate of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15-year period was 7%. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 33% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term), 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 9.25% in the long-term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would cumulatively impact future Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. (Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.) • The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 9% for 2009, declining to 5% by 2015 and will remain at 5% for the years thereafter. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $5. • The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $13.35. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 10%. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 4%. • Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge 30 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable value. • The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. • Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. • Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.) Outlook Looking forward into 2009, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. The Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, could impact future operating results. While the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to negatively impact the Company’s results in 2009, the Company believes most, if not all, of the impact should be offset over the course of the year. The extent to which the Company is able to offset the effect of the strengthened U.S. dollar will be impacted by the sustainability of benefits from recent commodity cost declines and the Company’s ability to successfully implement selling price increases and cost-savings initiatives. Moreover, difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact our suppliers, customers and consumers which could, in turn, have an adverse impact on our business. Our recent finalization of the 2004 Restructuring Program should enhance our ability to compete successfully in the current environment. As a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company streamlined its global supply chain, reallocated resources to enhance the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing countries and other key markets and consolidated these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Company’s other on-going cost-savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and markets, new product development, while also supporting an increased level of profitability. 31 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Accordingly, we believe we are well-prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, our experience operating in challenging environments and our continued focus on our strategic initiatives: getting closer to the consumer, the profession and our customers; effectiveness and efficiency in everything; innovation everywhere; and leadership. This focus, together with the strength of our global brand names and our broad international presence in both mature and developing markets, should position us well to increase shareholder value over the long-term.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2012,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive Overview and OutlookColgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. Approximately 80% of our net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 50% of our net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Greater Asia/Africa (excluding Japan) and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through specialty pet retailers and the veterinary profession.On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, and the Company’s corporate governance practices (including the Company’s Code of Conduct), help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products.The investments needed to support this growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition.On June 20, 2011, the Company, Colgate-Palmolive Europe Sàrl, Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC (together with Unilever N.V., “Unilever”) finalized the Company’s acquisition from Unilever of the Sanex personal care business in accordance with a Business and Share Sale and Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of €676 ($966), subject to certain post-closing purchase price adjustments. The acquisition was financed with available cash, proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Euro-denominated investment portfolio and the issuance of commercial paper.On July 29, 2011, in connection with the Sanex acquisition, Colgate sold its laundry detergent business in Colombia to Unilever for $215 resulting in a pretax gain of $207 ($135 aftertax gain). This gain was more than offset by pretax costs of $224 ($177 aftertax costs) associated with the implementation of various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives, the sale of land in Mexico and a competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business, as discussed further below.The various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives include the integration of Sanex, the right-sizing of the Colombia business and the closing of an oral care facility in Mississauga, Canada and a Hill’s facility in Los Angeles, CA.13(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On September 13, 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the United States of America the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility are located. The sale price is payable in three installments, with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property, which is expected to occur in 2014. The Company intends to re-invest these payments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility to be constructed at its Mission Hills, Mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within Mexico City and to prepare the existing site for transfer. As a result, over the next three years, the Company expects to make capital improvements and incur costs to exit the site. These exit costs will primarily be related to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition.As disclosed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, with over 80% of its Net sales generated outside of the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. For example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in Venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange controls, price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources.In particular, as a result of the devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte described more fully in Note 13 “Venezuela” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the local currency operations of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary (CP Venezuela) now translate into fewer U.S. dollars. The Company has taken, and continues to take, actions to mitigate the impact of both devaluations on its operations, although its ability to do so in the future may be limited due to new price controls instituted by the Venezuelan government. As a result, the Company may be unable to implement its pricing strategy to offset the effects of inflation in Venezuela.Additionally, the Venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls and currency exchange and payment controls. During 2010, a new currency market was established and the government closed the free-floating parallel market. Under existing regulations, CP Venezuela is not permitted to access the new currency market, but continues to have limited access to U.S. dollars at the official rate, and currently only for imported goods. As a result, CP Venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods through a combination of U.S. dollars obtained from the government at the official rate, intercompany borrowings and existing U.S. dollar cash balances, which were obtained previously through parallel market transactions and through the prior liquidation of its U.S. dollar-denominated bond portfolio.The Company’s business in Venezuela, and the Company's ability to repatriate its earnings, continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange, pricing or imports or other governmental actions. For the year ended December 31, 2011, CP Venezuela represented approximately 5% of the Company’s consolidated Net sales. At December 31, 2011, CP Venezuela’s local currency monetary net asset position was approximately $311. Looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending. Additionally, we continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results.The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s recently updated strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brand names and its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long term.Results of OperationsNet SalesWorldwide Net sales were $16,734 in 2011, up 7.5% from 2010, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 3.0%. Excluding the impact of the divestment of the non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia, volume increased 4.0%. The Sanex business contributed 1.0% to worldwide Net sales and volume growth in 2011. Organic sales (Net sales excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) increased 4.0%, on organic volume growth of 3.0% in 2011. Organic volume growth excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestments.14(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $14,562 in 2011, up 8.0% from 2010, driven by volume growth of 4.0%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 3.0%. Excluding the impact of the divestment of the non-core detergent business in Colombia, volume increased 4.5%. The Sanex business contributed 1.0% to sales and volume growth in 2011. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment increased 4.5% on organic volume growth of 3.5% in 2011. Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 4.5% in 2011 to $2,172 driven by net selling price increases of 1.5%, and a positive foreign exchange impact of 3.0%, while volume remained flat. Organic sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 1.5% in 2011.Worldwide Net sales were $15,564 in 2010, up 1.5% from 2009 as volume growth of 3.0% and level selling prices were partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 1.5%. Worldwide organic sales increased 3.0% in 2010.Gross ProfitWorldwide Gross profit margin decreased to 57.3% in 2011 from 59.1% in 2010. Excluding the impact of costs associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives of 30 basis points (bps), gross profit margin was 57.6% in 2011. The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs driven by global commodity cost increases (390 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (190 bps) and by higher pricing (50 bps).Worldwide Gross profit margin increased to 59.1% in 2010 from 58.8% in 2009. The increase in 2010 was primarily driven by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (170 bps) and by higher pricing (10 bps), partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs driven by global commodity cost increases (140 bps).Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 34.4% in 2011, 34.8% in 2010 and 34.5% in 2009. Excluding the impact of costs associated with various business realignment and other cost saving initiatives, Selling, general and administrative expenses were 34.3% in 2011. The 50 bps decrease in 2011 was primarily due to lower advertising spending (20 bps) and lower overhead expenses (30 bps). In 2011, advertising increased 4.7% to $1,734 as compared with $1,656 in 2010, but decreased as a percentage of Net sales from 10.6% in 2010 to 10.4% in 2011. The 30 bps increase in 2010 was primarily due to higher advertising spending (60 bps), partially offset by the impact of cost-saving initiatives. Other (Income) Expense, NetOther (income) expense, net was ($9), $301 and $111 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below:Other (income) expense, net 2011 2010 2009Amortization of intangible assets $28 $22 $22Gain on sales of non-core product lines (207) (50) (5)Business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives 136 — —Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico 13 — —Charge for a French competition law matter 21 — —Sanex acquisition transaction costs 12 — —Venezuela hyperinflationary transition charge — 271 —Gain from remeasurement of Venezuelan balance sheet — (10) —Remeasurement of certain liabilities in Venezuela — — 27Termination benefits — 86 —Legal and environmental matters 11 (3) 27Asset impairments — 5 16Equity (income) (6) (5) (5)Other, net (17) (15) 29Total Other (income) expense, net $(9) $301 $11115(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Operating ProfitIn 2011, Operating profit increased 10% to $3,841 from $3,489 in 2010. In 2010, Operating profit decreased 3% to $3,489 from $3,615 in 2009.In 2011, Operating profit was impacted by the gain on the sale of the detergent business in Colombia, costs associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico and a charge for a competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business. In 2010, Operating profit was impacted by a one-time charge related to the transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela, termination benefits and the gain on sales of non-core product lines. Excluding these items in both years, Operating profit increased 2% in 2011 and 5% in 2010 as follows: 2011 2010 % Change 2009 % ChangeOperating profit, GAAP $3,841 $3,489 10% $3,615 (3)%Gain on sales of non-core product lines (207) (50) — — —Business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives 190 — — — —Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico 13 — — — —Charge for a French competition law matter 21 — — — —Venezuela hyperinflationary transition charge — 271 — — —Termination benefits — 86 — — —Operating profit, non-GAAP $3,858 $3,796 2% $3,615 5 %Interest Expense, NetInterest expense, net was $52 in 2011 compared with $59 in 2010 and $77 in 2009. The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2010 to 2011 was mainly due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher debt balances. The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2009 to 2010 was due to lower average interest rates.Income TaxesThe effective income tax rate was 32.6% in 2011, 32.6% in 2010 and 32.2% in 2009 and all years benefited from global tax strategies. The impact on the Company’s effective income tax rate of the items described above was as follows: 2011 2010Effective income tax rate, as reported32.6 % 32.6 %Gain on sales of non-core product lines(0.1)% — %Business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives(0.5)% — %Charge for a French competition law matter(0.2)% — %Transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela— % (2.4)%Termination benefits— % (0.1)%Reorganization of an overseas subsidiary— % 0.8 %Effective income tax rate, Non-GAAP31.8 % 30.9 %The Non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 31.8% in 2011 includes a benefit of 40 bps related to a change in state tax law. The Non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 30.9% in 2010 includes a benefit of 140 bps related to the remeasurement of the Venezuelan balance sheet and lower taxes on unpaid remittances.Net Income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive CompanyNet income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company was $2,431, or $4.94 per share on a diluted basis, in 2011 compared with $2,203, or $4.31 per share on a diluted basis, in 2010 and $2,291, or $4.37 per share on a diluted basis, in 2009. In 2011, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company included an aftertax gain on the sale of the laundry detergent business in Colombia of $135 ($0.27 per diluted share), which was more than offset by aftertax costs of $177 ($0.36 per diluted share) associated with the implementation of various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives, the sale of land in Mexico and a competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business.16(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In 2010, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company included a one-time charge of $271 ($0.53 per diluted share) related to the transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela, $61 ($0.12 per diluted share) in aftertax charges for termination benefits, a $30 ($0.06 per diluted share) aftertax gain from the sale of non-core product lines in Latin America and a $31 ($0.06 per diluted share) aftertax gain related to the reorganization of an overseas subsidiary. Excluding the items described above, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company in 2011 was $2,473 as compared to $2,474 in 2010 and earnings per common share on a diluted basis increased 4% to $5.03. Excluding the items described above, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company in 2010 increased 8% to $2,474 and earnings per share on a diluted basis increased 11% to $4.84. Segment ResultsThe Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.North America 2011 2010 % Change 2009 % ChangeNet sales$2,995 $3,005 (0.5)% $2,950 2.0%Operating profit$791 $884 (11)% $843 5%% of Net sales26.4% 29.4% (300)bps 28.6% 80bpsNet sales in North America decreased 0.5% in 2011 to $2,995, as volume growth of 2.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 0.5% were more than offset by net selling price decreases of 3.0%. Organic sales in North America decreased 1.0% in 2011. Net sales in North America increased 2.0% in 2010 to $3,005 as a result of 3.5% volume growth and a 1.0% positive impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by 2.5% net selling price decreases. Organic sales in North America grew 1.0% in 2010.Operating profit in North America decreased 11% in 2011 to $791, or 26.4% of Net sales. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was driven by a decrease in Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales and by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales. The decrease in Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was a result of lower pricing due to increased promotional investments and higher raw and packaging material costs reflecting global commodity cost increases, which were partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased due to higher overhead expenses, which were partially offset by lower advertising expenses as a percentage of Net sales. Operating profit in North America increased 5% in 2010 to $884, or 29.4% of Net sales. The increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was driven by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales due to lower overhead expenses and advertising expenses as a percentage of Net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was flat as higher raw and packaging material costs and increased promotional investments were fully offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives.

While Operating profit in Latin America increased 9% in 2011 to $1,414, driven by strong sales growth, it decreased as a percentage of Net sales to 29.6%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales which was partially offset by an increase in Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales. The increase in Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was driven by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs reflecting global commodity cost increases. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to higher overhead expenses and higher advertising investments supporting volume growth.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 is presented below. The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.The following table provides a quantitative reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2011OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America(1.0)%0.5%0.0%(0.5)%Latin America11.5%2.0%(1.5)%12.0%Europe/South Pacific(2.0)%7.0%4.0%9.0%Greater Asia/Africa7.0%2.0%0.5%9.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care4.5%3.0%0.5%8.0%Pet Nutrition1.5%3.0%0.0%4.5%Total Company4.0%3.0%0.5%7.5%20(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Year ended December 31, 2010OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America1.0%1.0%0.0%2.0%Latin America7.5%(9.0)%0.0%(1.5)%Europe/South Pacific(1.0)%(0.5)%0.0%(1.5)%Greater Asia/Africa9.0%4.0%0.0%13.0%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care4.0%(2.0)%0.0%2.0%Pet Nutrition(3.5)%1.0%0.0%(2.5)%Total Company3.0%(1.5)%0.0%1.5%The following table provides a quantitative reconciliation of various (Non-GAAP) financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 As Reported (GAAP)Gain on Sale of Colombia Detergent BusinessBusiness Realignment InitiativesMexico Land SaleFrench Competition Law MatterAs Adjusted(Non-GAAP ) As Reported1 (GAAP)Venezuela Hyper-inflationaryTermination BenefitsGain on Sale of Non-Core Product LinesTax Initiatives2As Adjusted(Non-GAAP 1)Cost of sales$7,144 $44 $7,100 Gross profit9,590 (44) 9,634 Gross profit margin57.3% 57.6% Selling, general and administrative expenses5,758 10 5,748 Other (income) expense, net(9)$(207)$136$13$2128 $301$271$86$(50)$—$(6)Operating profit3,841207(190)(13)(21)3,858 3,489(271)(86)50—3,796Operating profit margin23.0% 23.1% 22.4% 24.4%Income before income taxes3,789207(190)(13)(21)3,806 3,430(271)(86)50—3,737Provision for income taxes1,23572(42)(4)—1,209 1,117—(25)20(31)1,153Effective tax rate32.6% 31.8% 32.6% 30.9%Net income including noncontrolling interests2,554135(148)(9)(21)2,597 2,313(271)(61)30312,584Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company$2,431$135$(147)$(9)$(21)$2,473 $2,203$(271)$(61)$30$31$2,474Earnings per common share3 Basic$4.98$0.28$(0.30)$(0.02)$(0.04)$5.06 $4.45$(0.56)$(0.13)$0.06$0.06$5.00Diluted$4.94$0.27$(0.30)$(0.02)$(0.04)$5.03 $4.31$(0.53)$(0.12)$0.06$0.06$4.841 Includes a $46 pretax gain ($59 aftertax gain, $0.12 diluted earnings per share) related to the remeasurement of the Venezuelan balance sheet and lower taxes on accrued but unpaid remittances resulting from the currency devaluation in January 2010 and a $36 pretax loss ($2 aftertax gain) related to the remeasurement of the Venezuelan balance sheet and lower taxes on accrued but unpaid remittances resulting from the currency devaluation announced in December 2010.2 Includes a gain related to a tax initiative involving the reorganization of an overseas subsidiary.3 The impact of Non-GAAP adjustments on the basic and diluted earnings per share may not necessarily equal the difference between ""As Reported (GAAP)"" and ""As Adjusted (Non-GAAP)"" as a result of rounding.21(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations in 2011 was $2,896 as compared with $3,211 in 2010 and $3,277 in 2009. The decrease in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in voluntary benefit plan contributions. The decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to increased working capital. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company’s working capital increased to 0.7% of Net sales in 2011 as compared with 0.3% in 2010. The increase in working capital as a percentage of Net sales in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories. Although higher in absolute dollars, accounts receivable and inventory levels were in line with prior year levels of days sales outstanding for receivables and months coverage of inventory. Investing activities used $1,213 in 2011, compared with $658 and $841 during 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the purchase of the Sanex business for $966 which was funded with available cash, including the proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Euro-denominated investment portfolio, and the issuance of commercial paper, partially offset by the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in Colombia for $215. Additionally, in 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility are located. The sale price is payable in three installments, with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property, which is expected to occur in 2014. During 2011, the Company received the first installment of $24. Capital expenditures were $537, $550 and $575 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures continue to focus primarily on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2012 are expected to be at an annual rate of approximately 3.5% of Net sales.Financing activities used $1,242 of cash during 2011 compared to $2,624 and $2,270 during 2010 and 2009. This difference was primarily due to higher net proceeds from the issuance of debt and a lower level of share repurchases. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and dividends paid, partially offset by higher net proceeds from issuances of debt. Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $4,776 as of December 31, 2011, as compared to $3,376 as of December 31, 2010, and total debt increased to $4,810 as of December 31, 2011, as compared to $3,424 as of December 31, 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company issued $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated three-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.6%, $400 of U.S. dollar-denominated five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.3% and $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.45% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings and to repay outstanding indebtedness under a €408 credit facility. During the second quarter of 2011, the Company issued $250 of U.S. dollar-denominated three-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.250% and $250 of U.S. dollar-denominated six-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.625% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company issued $250 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.95% and $188 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.375% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company issued $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated six-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.15% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second quarter of 2011, fourth quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2009 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,705 (including under the two facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. The facility, which expires in November 2016, replaced an existing credit facility with a capacity of $1,600 which was due to expire in November 2012. The Company also has the ability to draw $145 from a revolving credit facility that expires in November 2012. Commitment fees related to credit facilities are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $671 and $214 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2011 and 2010 were $1,497 and $1,146, respectively. The 22(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)maximum daily balance outstanding for commercial paper during 2011 and 2010 was $1,897 and $1,628, respectively. The Company regularly classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt as it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in 2016.Following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities OutstandingPayable to banks 0.9% 2012 $34 3.1% 2011 $48Commercial paper 0.1% 2012 671 0.2% 2011 214Total $705 $262Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2011 were $1,203, an increase from $1,142 in 2010 and $981 in 2009. Common stock dividend payments increased to $2.27 per share in 2011 from $2.03 per share in 2010 and $1.72 per share in 2009. The Series B Preference stock dividend payments were $16.24 per share in 2010 and $13.76 per share in 2009. The Series B Preference Stock was converted to common stock on December 29, 2010. On February 24, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.58 per share, effective as of the second quarter 2011.The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On September 8, 2011 the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2011 Program) that replaced the Company’s previous share repurchase program which had been approved in 2010 (the 2010 Program). The 2011 Program authorizes the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs.Aggregate repurchases in 2011 consisted of 20.4 million common shares under both the 2011 Program and the 2010 Program, and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,806. Aggregate repurchases in 2010 consisted of 24.4 million common shares under both the 2010 Program and the 2008 Program, and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $2,020. Aggregate repurchases in 2009 consisted of 13.9 million common shares under the 2008 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,063.The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion $4,776 $1,017 $264 $882 $493 $254 $1,866Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(1) 618 86 81 72 59 49 271Leases 1,282 201 174 153 141 123 490Purchase obligations(2) 460 196 161 57 31 15 —Total $7,136 $1,500 $680 $1,164 $724 $441 $2,627_______(1) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(2) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2011 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.23(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2013. Management’s best estimate of voluntary contributions to the U.S. pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2012 is approximately $100. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2012 from the Company's assets is estimated to be approximately $87.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Notes 2 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements. Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, Venezuela), inventories, prepaid expenses, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward, option and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.24(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $1 at December 31, 2011 and net unrealized losses of $3 at December 31, 2010. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2011, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $42.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2011 variable rate debt levels, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased Interest expense, net by $18 in 2011. Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tropical oils, essential oils, tallow, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized losses of $1 and net unrealized gains of $4 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At the end of 2011, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have increased the net unrealized loss to $3. Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with highly rated, diverse counterparties.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income” ASU No. 2011-05 eliminates the current option to disclose other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. As permitted under ASU No. 2011-05, the Company has elected to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements beginning in the first quarter of 2012. This standard will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a 25(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)percent of sales would have decreased by 750 bps, from 57.3% to 49.8% in 2011 and decreased by 730 bps in 2010 and 2009, with no impact on reported earnings.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2011, 2010 and 2009 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies.▪In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans was 4.90%, 5.30% and 5.75% as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The discount rate for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.26%, 5.30% and 5.75% as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 7.75% as of December 31, 2011 and 8.00% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return.Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 3%, 3%, 6%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 40% in fixed income securities, 52% in equity securities and 8% in real estate and alternative investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $9. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $5. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 8.0% for 2012, declining to 5.0% by 2018 and remaining at 5.0% for the years thereafter. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $5.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $11.93. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include the expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7%. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%.▪The asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Except for the intangible assets acquired in the recent Sanex acquisition, the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded book value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. ▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.26(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings growth, financial goals, the impact of currency devaluations and exchange and price controls, including in Venezuela, cost-reduction plans, tax rates, new product introductions or commercial investment levels, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to us and the markets we serve, including the uncertain economic environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, currency rate fluctuations, exchange and price controls, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, our ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, changes in the policies of retail trade customers and our ability to continue lowering costs. For information about these and other factors that could impact our business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.ITEM 7A.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2013,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive Overview and OutlookColgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. Approximately 80% of the Company’s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 50% of the Company’s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Greater Asia/Africa (excluding Japan) and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through specialty pet retailers and the veterinary profession.On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, Net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), Gross profit margin, Operating profit, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per common share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products.The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses and distribution and logistics, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. As disclosed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” with approximately 80% of its Net sales generated outside of the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political and economic uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. For example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in Venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price controls, labor disruptions and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources.15(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In particular, the Company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in February 2013, described in Note 14 “Venezuela” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency, and effective on February 9, 2013 the official exchange rate changed from 4.30 to 6.30 per dollar. This devaluation had no impact on the Company's 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's preliminary assessment of the one-time impact of the devaluation is that the Company will incur an aftertax loss of approximately $120 ($0.25 per common share) in the first quarter of 2013, related to the remeasurement of the local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation. There will also be ongoing impacts primarily related to the remeasurement of the local financial statements at the new exchange rate. We will remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela for 2013 at 6.30, the rate at which we now expect to remit dividends. While it is difficult to project, it is the Company's preliminary estimate that these ongoing impacts will reduce diluted earnings per common share by $0.05 to $0.07 per share per quarter in 2013 taking into account both the Company's ability to take actions in Venezuela and elsewhere to mitigate the effect of the devaluation and ongoing price control regulations in Venezuela. In addition, the Venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls and price controls. While CP Venezuela continues to have limited access to U.S. dollars from the government (CADIVI), and currently only for imported goods, the timing of receipt of these funds has slowed and become increasingly unpredictable. CP Venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods primarily through a combination of U.S. dollars obtained from CADIVI, intercompany borrowings and the use of financial and other intermediaries and, to a lesser extent, with existing U.S. dollar cash balances, which were obtained previously through parallel market transactions and through the prior liquidation of its U.S. dollar-denominated bond portfolio. On April 1, 2012, additional price controls became effective, affecting most products in CP Venezuela’s portfolio, thereby further restricting the Company’s ability to implement price increases, which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation. In the fourth quarter of 2012, production at CP Venezuela was negatively impacted by labor issues within the country.The Company’s business in Venezuela, and the Company’s ability to repatriate its earnings, continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange, pricing or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest. Following the February 2013 devaluation, CP Venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary asset position, which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of a further devaluation, was reduced to approximately $390 as compared to approximately $520 at December 31, 2012, and it is expected that CP Venezuela will represent less than 4% of the Company's consolidated Net sales in 2013. The Company continues to actively manage its investment in and exposure to Venezuela.In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program (the 2012 Restructuring Program) for sustained growth. The program’s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2016, is projected to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,100 and $1,250 ($775 and $875 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $365 to $435 pretax ($275 to $325 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. For more information regarding the 2012 Restructuring Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below. In 2012, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $14 associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives and aftertax costs of $18 related to the sale of land in Mexico (discussed below).On September 13, 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the United States of America the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility are located. The sale price is payable in three installments, with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property, which is expected to occur in 2014. The Company is re-investing these payments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility to be constructed at its Mission Hills, Mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within Mexico City and to prepare the existing site for transfer. As a result, the Company expects to make capital improvements and incur costs to exit the site through 2014. These exit costs will primarily be related to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready.16(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On July 29, 2011, in connection with the Sanex acquisition (discussed below), Colgate sold its non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia to Unilever for $215 resulting in a pretax gain of $207 ($135 aftertax). In 2011, this gain was more than offset by pretax costs of $224 ($177 aftertax) associated with the implementation of business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives, the sale of land in Mexico and a competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 ""Legal Proceedings"" and Note 13 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives include the integration of Sanex, the right-sizing of the Colombia business and the closing of an oral care facility in Mississauga, Canada, and a Hill’s facility in Los Angeles, California. On June 20, 2011, the Company, Colgate-Palmolive Europe Sàrl, Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC (together with Unilever N.V., “Unilever”) finalized the Company’s acquisition from Unilever of the Sanex personal care business in accordance with a Business and Share Sale and Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of €676 ($966). The acquisition was financed with available cash, proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Euro-denominated investment portfolio and the issuance of commercial paper.Looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. Additionally, we continue to experience foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results.The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brand names, its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives such as the 2012 Restructuring Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long-term.Results of OperationsNet SalesWorldwide Net sales were $17,085 in 2012, up 2.0% from 2011, as volume growth of 3.0% and net selling price increases of 3.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 4.0%. Excluding the impact of the divestment of the non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia, volume increased 3.5%. The Sanex business contributed 0.5% to worldwide Net sales and volume growth in 2012. Organic sales (Net sales excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) increased 6.0% on organic volume growth of 3.0% in 2012. Organic volume growth excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestments.Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $14,925 in 2012, up 2.5% from 2011, as volume growth of 4.0% and net selling price increases of 3.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 4.5%. Excluding the impact of the divestment of the non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia, volume increased 4.5%. The Sanex business contributed 1.0% to sales and volume growth in 2012. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment increased 6.5% on organic volume growth of 3.5% in 2012. Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition decreased 0.5% in 2012 to $2,160, as a volume decline of 2.5% and negative foreign exchange of 2.0% were partially offset by net selling price increases of 4.0%. Organic sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 1.5% in 2012.Worldwide Net sales were $16,734 in 2011, up 7.5% from 2010, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 3.0%. Excluding the impact of the divestment of the non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia, volume increased 4.0%. The Sanex business contributed 1.0% to worldwide Net sales and volume growth in 2011. Organic sales increased 4.0%, on organic volume growth of 3.0% in 2011. Gross Profit/MarginWorldwide Gross profit increased 4% to $9,932 in 2012 from $9,590 in 2011. Gross profit in both periods included the 17(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)impact of costs associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives. Gross profit in 2012 also included the impact of charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and costs related to the sale of land in Mexico. Excluding the items described above, Gross profit increased to $9,963 in 2012 from $9,634 in 2011, primarily due to strong sales growth, cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives and higher pricing, which were partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs driven by global commodity cost increases and negative foreign exchange transaction costs.Worldwide Gross profit margin increased to 58.1% in 2012 from 57.3% in 2011. Excluding the items described above, Gross profit margin increased by 70 basis points (bps) to 58.3% in 2012. The increase was primarily due to cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (190 bps) and higher pricing (120 bps), which were partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs driven by global commodity cost increases and negative foreign exchange transaction costs (250 bps).Worldwide Gross profit increased 4% to $9,590 in 2011 from $9,204 in 2010. Excluding the impact of costs associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives in 2011, Gross profit increased to $9,634 in 2011. Worldwide Gross profit margin decreased to 57.3% in 2011 from 59.1% in 2010. Excluding the impact of costs associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives in 2011, Gross profit margin was 57.6% in 2011. The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs driven by global commodity cost increases (390 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (190 bps) and higher pricing (50 bps). 2012 2011 2010Gross profit, GAAP $9,932 $9,590 $9,2042012 Restructuring Program 2 — —Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico 24 — —Business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives 5 44 —Gross profit, non-GAAP $9,963 $9,634 $9,204 2012 2011 Basis Point Change 2010 Basis Point ChangeGross profit margin, GAAP 58.1% 57.3% 80 59.1% (180)2012 Restructuring Program — — — Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico 0.2 — — Business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives — 0.3 — Gross profit margin, non-GAAP 58.3% 57.6% 70 59.1% (150)Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $5,930 in 2012 from $5,758 in 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses in both periods included the impact of costs associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012 also included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Excluding these costs, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $5,910 in 2012 from $5,748 in 2011.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased to 34.7% in 2012 from 34.4% in 2011. Excluding the items described above, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 34.6%, an increase of 30 bps as compared to 2011. The 30 bps increase in 2012 was a result of higher overhead expenses (20 bps) due primarily to increased commercial capabilities on the ground in emerging markets and higher advertising investments (10 bps). In 2012, advertising increased 3.3% to $1,792 as compared with $1,734 in 2011, or 10.5% as a percentage of Net sales in 2012 as compared to 10.4% in 2011.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% to $5,758 in 2011 from $5,414 in 2010.

The program’s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.The 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to produce significant benefits in the Company’s long-term business performance. The major objectives of the program include:•Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the Company’s operations around the world. •Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions.•Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company’s gross and operating profit.•Building on Colgate’s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth.26(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program is projected to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,100 and $1,250 ($775 and $875 aftertax), which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (15%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (15%). Anticipated charges for 2013 are expected to amount to approximately $260 to $310 ($185 to $220 aftertax). Over the course of the four-year 2012 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe/South Pacific (20%), Latin America (5%), Greater Asia/Africa (10%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (15%) and Corporate (35%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is expected that by the end of 2016, the 2012 Restructuring Program will reduce the Company’s global employee workforce by approximately 6% from the 2012 level of approximately 38,000. Savings are projected to be in the range of $365 to $435 ($275 to $325 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. Savings in 2013 should approximate $40 to $50 ($30 to $40 aftertax) effective in the latter half of the year. Initiatives under the program are focused on the following three areas:•Expanding Commercial Hubs - Building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continue to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.•Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions - Implementing the Company’s shared service organizational model, already successful in Europe, in all regions of the world. Initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services will be expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions. •Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities - Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.

Costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2012 primarily concern projects related to the simplification and streamlining of the Company's research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain in Europe as well as the restructuring of certain commercial operations in advance of implementing an overall hubbing strategy.27(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following table summarizes the pretax restructuring and implementation-related charges discussed above and the related accrual activities for the fourth quarter of 2012: Employee-RelatedCosts IncrementalDepreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Charges $78 $— $— $11 $89Cash payments (1) — — (4) (5)Charges against assets — — — — —Foreign exchange 7 — — (2) 5Balance at December 31, 2012 $84 $— $— $5 $89Employee-related costs primarily included severance and other termination benefits and were calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements.Other charges consisted primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges included third-party incremental costs of $8 related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives and contract termination costs of $3 directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges were expensed as incurred.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 is provided below.Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per common share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impacts of the charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, the gains on the sales of non-core product lines, costs associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico, a charge for a competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business, the charge related to the transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela, termination benefits and the gain related to the reorganization of an overseas subsidiary (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.28(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following table provides a quantitative reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2012OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America3.5%0.0%0.0%3.5%Latin America10.5%(6.5)%(1.5)%2.5%Europe/South Pacific(0.5)%(5.0)%3.0%(2.5)%Greater Asia/Africa11.0%(4.5)%0.5%7.0%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care6.5%(4.5)%0.5%2.5%Pet Nutrition1.5%(2.0)%0.0%(0.5)%Total Company6.0%(4.0)%0.0%2.0%Year ended December 31, 2011OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America(1.0)%0.5%0.0%(0.5)%Latin America11.5%2.0%(1.5)%12.0%Europe/South Pacific(2.0)%7.0%4.0%9.0%Greater Asia/Africa7.0%2.0%0.5%9.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care4.5%3.0%0.5%8.0%Pet Nutrition1.5%3.0%0.0%4.5%Total Company4.0%3.0%0.5%7.5%Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations in 2012 was $3,196 as compared with $2,896 in 2011 and $3,211 in 2010. Net cash provided by operations for 2012 increased due to higher operating earnings, lower voluntary benefit plan contributions as compared to 2011 and a continued focus on working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory management. This increase was partially offset by higher income tax payments and payment of the previously disclosed competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business. The decrease in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due primarily to an increase in voluntary benefit plan contributions. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Overall, the Company’s working capital remained flat at 0.7% of Net sales in 2012 as compared with 2011.29(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Approximately 75% of total program charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, currently estimated between $1,100 and $1,250 ($775 and $875 aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings are currently projected to be in the range of $365 to $435 ($275 to $325 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. The anticipated charges for 2013 are expected to amount to approximately $260 to $310 ($185 to $220 aftertax) and savings in 2013 should approximate $40 to $50 ($30 to $40 aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 Restructuring Program will be funded from operating cash flow. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2012 will be paid before year end 2013.Investing activities used $865 in 2012, compared with $1,213 and $658 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to the acquisition of the Sanex business in 2011 for $966. In 2012, the Company acquired the remaining interest in Tom's of Maine for $18. During 2011 and 2012, the Company received the first and second installments of $24 and $36, respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico. The final installment of $60 is due upon transfer of the property, which is expected to occur in 2014. The Company sold its non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia in 2011 for $215 ($135 aftertax gain). Purchases of marketable securities and investments increased in 2012 to $545 from $356 in 2011 primarily due to the Company's investments through its subsidiary in Venezuela in local currency denominated, fixed interest rate bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. Capital expenditures were $565, $537 and $550 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2013 are expected to increase to an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales, primarily driven by the 2012 Restructuring Program. Financing activities used $2,301 of cash during 2012 compared to $1,242 and $2,624 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of debt, an increase in dividends paid in 2012, and higher share repurchase costs due to an appreciation in stock value, partially offset by higher proceeds from exercises of stock options. The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to higher net proceeds from the issuance of debt and a lower level of share repurchases as compared to 2010. Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $5,176 as of December 31, 2012, as compared to $4,776 as of December 31, 2011, and total debt increased to $5,230 as of December 31, 2012, as compared to $4,810 as of December 31, 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of U.S. dollar-denominated ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.95% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. During the second quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of U.S. dollar-denominated ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.3% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in 2012 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings, which were used by the Company for general corporate purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company issued $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated three-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.6%, $400 of U.S. dollar-denominated five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.3% and $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.45% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2011 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings and to repay outstanding indebtedness under a €408 credit facility. During the second quarter of 2011, the Company issued $250 of U.S. dollar-denominated three-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.25% and $250 of U.S. dollar-denominated six-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.625% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company issued $250 of U.S. dollar-denominated ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.95% and $188 of U.S. dollar-denominated five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.375% under the Company's shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings.At December 31, 2012, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,547 (including under the two facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. In 2012, this facility was extended for an additional year and will expire in November 2017. The Company also has the ability to draw $145 from a revolving credit facility that expires in November 2013. Commitment fees related to credit facilities are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $443 and $671 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2012 and 2011 were $1,562 and $1,497, respectively. The maximum daily balance outstanding for commercial paper during 2012 and 2011 was $2,042 and $1,897, respectively. The Company regularly classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt as it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in 2017.30(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2012 and 2011: 2012 2011 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities OutstandingPayable to banks 1.0% 2013 $54 0.9% 2012 $34Commercial paper 0.1% 2013 443 0.1% 2012 671Total $497 $705Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2012 were $1,277, an increase from $1,203 in 2011 and $1,142 in 2010. Common stock dividend payments increased to $2.44 per share in 2012 from $2.27 per share in 2011 and $2.03 per share in 2010. On March 8, 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.62 per share from $0.58 per share, effective as of the second quarter 2012. The Series B Preference stock dividend payments were $16.24 per share in 2010. The Series B Preference Stock was converted to common stock on December 29, 2010. The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. The share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in September 2011 (the 2011 Program) authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs.Aggregate share repurchases in 2012 consisted of 18.8 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 0.6 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,943. Aggregate repurchases in 2011 consisted of 20.4 million common shares under both the 2011 Program and a previously authorized repurchase program, and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,806. Aggregate repurchases in 2010 consisted of 24.4 million common shares under previously authorized repurchase programs, and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $2,020.Cash and cash equivalents increased $6 during 2012 to $884 at December 31, 2012, compared to $878 at December 31, 2011, of which $861 and $824 were held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts include $170 and $385 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which are subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings.As of December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $4,300 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the Company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings. These earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, therefore, are not subject to such taxes. Should these earnings be repatriated in the future, they would be subject to applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes. Determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable.31(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012: Payments Due by Period Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion $5,176 $693 $887 $494 $254 $678 $2,170Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(1) 605 89 81 67 58 43 267Leases 1,155 192 159 143 123 110 428Purchase obligations(2) 806 381 283 119 23 — —Total $7,742 $1,355 $1,410 $823 $458 $831 $2,865_______(1) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(2) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2012 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2013. Management’s best estimate of voluntary contributions to the U.S. pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2013 is approximately $100. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2013 from the Company's assets is estimated to be approximately $94.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 ""Legal Proceedings"" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.32(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, Venezuela), inventories, prepaid expenses, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward, option and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $1 at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2012, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $40.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2012 variable rate debt levels, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased Interest expense, net by $12 in 2012.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tropical oils, essential oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized gains of $1 and net unrealized losses of $1 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At the end of 2012, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2.33(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, ""Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."" ASU No. 2013-02 requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements, for those amounts required to be reclassified into Net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period, cross-reference to other disclosures is required. As permitted under ASU 2013-02, the Company has elected to present reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income within a single note to the financial statements beginning the in first quarter of 2013. In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income.” ASU No. 2011-05 eliminates the current option to disclose other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. As permitted under ASU No. 2011-05, the Company has elected to present items of Net income and Other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in Cost of sales, Gross profit margin would have decreased by 740 bps, from 58.1% to 50.7% in 2012 and decreased by 750 bps and 730 bps in 2011 and 2010, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2012, 2011 and 2010 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies.▪In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 4.14%, 4.90% and 5.30% as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 4.32%, 5.26% and 5.30% as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the 34(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 7.30% as of December 31, 2012, 7.75% as of December 31, 2011 and 8.00% as of December 31, 2010. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, the expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return.Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 13%, 4%, 8%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 40% in fixed income securities, 52% in equity securities and 8% in real estate and alternative investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $2. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $7. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2012 and 4.00% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 7.5% for 2013, declining to 5.0% by 2018 and remaining at 5.0% for the years thereafter. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $6.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $13.46. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include the expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7%. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%.▪Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. The asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. Qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.The estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the recent Sanex acquisition, which were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded book value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values. ▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.35(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2014,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive Overview and OutlookColgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. Approximately 80% of the Company’s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with over 50% of the Company’s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific, Asia and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians.On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products.The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses and distribution and logistics, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. 15(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)As disclosed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” with approximately 80% of its Net sales generated outside the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. For example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in Venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources.In particular, the Company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in February 2013, described in Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective February 9, 2013 the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and the official exchange rate changed from 4.30 to 6.30 Venezuelan bolivares fuerte per dollar. The Company incurred a one-time, pretax loss of $172 ($111 aftertax loss), in the first quarter of 2013 related to the remeasurement of the net monetary assets in the local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation. The Company remeasures the financial statements of its Venezuelan subsidiary (“CP Venezuela”) at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends. At December 31, 2013, that rate was 6.30. As the local currency operations in Venezuela translated into fewer U.S. dollars, the February 2013 devaluation had and will continue to have an ongoing adverse effect on the Company’s reported results. In addition, the Venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls and price controls. Price controls, which became effective on April 1, 2012, affect most products in CP Venezuela’s portfolio and thereby further restrict the Company’s ability to implement price increases, which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations.CP Venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods primarily through a combination of U.S. dollars obtained from CADIVI and intercompany borrowings. The amount of U.S. dollars received from CADIVI in 2013 was higher than the amount received in 2012; however, CP Venezuela’s supply of U.S. dollars to fund imports has been limited and sporadic. In the second quarter of 2013, the Venezuelan government introduced a new currency market known as SICAD (Supplementary System for the Administration of Foreign Currency), which is an auction market, in which only companies invited by the Venezuelan government can participate. The SICAD currency market is expected to be accessible to the Company, however the Company was not able to participate in the auctions held through December 31, 2013. CP Venezuela's difficulty in accessing U.S. dollars to support its operations has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the business. Additionally, at times, production at CP Venezuela has also been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country. At December 31, 2013, CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary asset position, which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of a further devaluation, was approximately $600. This amount does not include $233 of devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government, as these bonds provide protection against devaluations by adjusting the amount of bolivares fuerte received at maturity for any devaluation subsequent to issuance. CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated non-monetary assets were approximately $335 at December 31, 2013 and included approximately $225 of fixed assets that could be subject to impairment if CP Venezuela continues to be unable to implement price increases to offset the impacts of continued high inflation or further devaluations, or if it does not have sufficient access to U.S. dollars to fund imports. For the year ended December 31, 2013, CP Venezuela represented approximately 4% of the Company’s consolidated Net sales and approximately 3% of the Company’s consolidated Operating profit excluding the impact of the one-time Venezuela devaluation charge and charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program (discussed below), the competition law matter in France related to the home care and personal care sectors and costs related to the sale of land in Mexico (discussed below). In late January 2014, the Venezuelan government made several announcements affecting currency exchange and other controls. Although the official exchange rate remains at 6.30 bolivares fuerte per dollar, the government announced that the exchange rate for foreign investments will move to the rate available on the SICAD currency market, which in the last auction was 11.70 bolivares fuerte per dollar. While there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature of transactions that will flow through SICAD and how SICAD will operate in the future, effective with the quarter ending March 31, 2014, the Company expects that the majority of CP Venezuela’s net monetary assets will be remeasured at the SICAD rate since that is the rate the Company now believes, based on the advice of legal counsel, will be applicable for future dividend remittances. In addition, because the official exchange rate remains at 6.30 bolivares fuerte per dollar, the Company currently expects that the $233 million of devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government and held by CP Venezuela will not revalue at the rate available on the SICAD currency market but will remain at the official rate. If the SICAD rate were to remain at 11.70 16(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)during the quarter ending March 31, 2014, the Company estimates it would incur a one-time aftertax loss of approximately $180-$200, or $0.19-$0.21 per diluted common share.Because the SICAD market is auction-based and auctions are held periodically during each quarter, the exchange rate available through SICAD may vary throughout the year which would cause additional remeasurements of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets and further impact CP Venezuela’s ongoing results.Although, as described above, there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the implementation of the SICAD rate, the Company anticipates that there also will be ongoing impacts primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements and, to a lesser degree, the import of materials at the new exchange rate. While it is still unclear, the Company believes that some of its imports may still qualify for the official rate of 6.30 bolivares fuerte per dollar. Based on this assumption and the SICAD rate at the most recent 11.70 bolivares fuertes per dollar, the Company preliminarily estimates that the ongoing impacts during 2014 would be in the range of $0.11-$0.14 per diluted common share. As part of the January 2014 announcements, the Venezuelan government also issued a new Law on Fair Pricing, establishing a maximum profit margin of 30%. At this time, it is unclear based on the current regulations how this new law may affect CP Venezuela and its current pricing structure and, as a result, its impact is not included in the range of estimated ongoing impacts outlined above.The Company’s business in Venezuela, and the Company’s ability to repatriate its earnings, continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange, pricing, payments, profits or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest. The Company continues to actively manage its investment in and exposure to Venezuela.In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program (the “2012 Restructuring Program”) for sustained growth. The program’s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2016, is projected to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,100 and $1,250 ($775 and $875 aftertax). Savings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $365 to $435 pretax ($275 to $325 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. In 2013 and 2012, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $278 and $70, respectively, associated with the 2012 Restructuring Program. For more information regarding the 2012 Restructuring Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below. In 2013 and 2012, the Company also incurred aftertax costs of $12 and $18, respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico and, in 2012, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $14 associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives.On September 13, 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the United States of America the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility are located. The sale price is payable in three installments, with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property, which is expected to occur in 2014. The Company is re-investing these payments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility to be constructed at its Mission Hills, Mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within Mexico City and to prepare the existing site for transfer. As a result, the Company expects to make capital improvements and incur costs to exit the site through 2014. These exit costs are primarily related to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready.On July 29, 2011, in connection with the Sanex acquisition (discussed below), Colgate sold its non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia to Unilever for $215 resulting in a pretax gain of $207 ($135 aftertax gain). In 2011, this gain was more than offset by pretax costs of $224 ($177 aftertax costs) associated with the implementation of various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives, the sale of land in Mexico and a competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives included the integration of Sanex, the right-sizing of the Colombia business and the closing of an oral care facility in Mississauga, Canada, and a Hill’s facility in Los Angeles, California. 17(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On June 20, 2011, the Company, Colgate-Palmolive Europe Sàrl, Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC (together with Unilever N.V., “Unilever”) finalized the Company’s acquisition from Unilever of the Sanex personal care business in accordance with a Business and Share Sale and Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of €676 ($966). The acquisition was financed with available cash, proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Euro-denominated investment portfolio and the issuance of commercial paper.Looking forward, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. While the global marketplace in which the Company operates has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from local competitors and other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the Company does. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. Additionally, the Company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results.The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brand names, its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives such as the 2012 Restructuring Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long-term. 18(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of OperationsNet SalesWorldwide Net sales were $17,420 in 2013, up 2.0% from 2012, as volume growth of 5.0% and net selling price increases of 1.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 4.0%. Organic sales (Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure as discussed below, increased 6.0%.Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $15,209 in 2013, up 2.0% from 2012, as volume growth of 5.5% and net selling price increases of 0.5% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 4.0%. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment increased 6.0%.The increase in organic sales in 2013 versus 2012 was driven by an increase in Oral Care sales, with the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories all contributing to growth. Personal Care and Home Care also contributed to organic sales growth due to strong sales in the bar soap category and the hand dish category, respectively. The Company’s share of the global toothpaste market was 44.8% on a year-to-date basis and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 32.9% on a year-to-date basis. Year-to-date market shares in toothpaste were up in Europe/South Pacific, Asia and Africa/Eurasia and down in North America and Latin America versus the year ago period. In the manual toothbrush category, year-to-date market shares were up in North America, Latin America and Europe/South Pacific, and down in Asia and Africa/Eurasia versus the year ago period.

In 2011, Operating profit also included the gain on the sale of the non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia and a charge for a competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business. Excluding these items in all years, as applicable, Operating profit increased 3% in 2013 and 4% in 2012, primarily due to sales growth and higher Gross profit margin. Operating profit margin was 20.4% in 2013, compared with 22.8% in 2012 and 23.0% in 2011. Excluding the items described above, Operating profit margin increased 30 bps to 23.8% in 2013 compared to 23.5% in 2012. This increase is mainly due to an increase in Gross profit (50 bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. Excluding the items described above, Operating profit margin increased 40 bps in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (70 bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. 2013 2012 % Change 2011 % ChangeOperating profit, GAAP $3,556 $3,889 (9)% $3,841 1%2012 Restructuring Program 371 89 — Venezuela devaluation charge 172 — — Charges for French competition law matters 23 — 21 Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico 18 24 13 Business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives — 21 190 Gain on sales of non-core product lines — — (207) Operating profit, non-GAAP $4,140 $4,023 3 % $3,858 4% 2013 2012 Basis Point Change 2011 Basis Point ChangeOperating profit margin, GAAP 20.4% 22.8% (240) 23.0 % (20)2012 Restructuring Program 2.2 0.5 — Venezuela devaluation charge 1.0 — — Charges for French competition law matters 0.1 — 0.1 Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico 0.1 0.1 0.1 Business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives — 0.1 1.1 Gain on sales of non-core product lines — — (1.2) Operating profit margin, non-GAAP 23.8% 23.5% 30 23.1 % 40 23(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest (Income) Expense, NetInterest (income) expense, net was ($9) in 2013, compared with $15 in 2012 and $52 in 2011. The decrease in Interest (income) expense, net from 2012 to 2013 and from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in interest income on investments held outside of the U.S., partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to higher debt balances. Income TaxesThe effective income tax rate was 32.4% in 2013, 32.1% in 2012 and 32.6% in 2011.

The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.Oral, Personal and Home CareEffective January 1, 2013, the Company realigned the geographic structure of its North America and Latin America reportable operating segments. In order to better leverage Latin America management’s knowledge of emerging market consumers to accelerate growth in the region, management responsibility for the Puerto Rico and CARICOM operations was transferred from North America to Latin America management. Accordingly, commencing with the Company’s financial reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, the results of the Puerto Rico and CARICOM operations, which represent less than 1% of the Company’s global business are reported in the Latin America reportable operating segment. Previously, Puerto Rico and CARICOM represented approximately 4% of Net sales of North America and now represent approximately 3% of Net sales of Latin America.In addition, given the growing importance of the Company’s operations in emerging markets, effective with the quarter ended September 30 2013, the Company began to separately report financial information for its Asia and Africa/Eurasia operating segments. Previously, the financial information for these operating segments was aggregated into the Greater Asia/Africa reportable operating segment. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure which results in modification to the geographic components of the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment, with no impact on historical Company results overall.

Organic sales in North America increased 3.5% in 2013. The increase in organic sales in North America in 2013 versus 2012 was driven by an increase in Oral Care sales with the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories all contributing to growth. Home Care sales also contributed to organic sales growth due to strong sales in the hand dish and fabric softener categories. 25(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Net sales in North America increased 3.5% in 2012 to $2,971, driven by volume growth of 2.0% and net selling price increases of 1.5%. Organic sales in North America increased 3.5% in 2012.Operating profit in North America increased 14% in 2013 to $927, or 290 bps to 30.2% of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (230 bps) and a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (40 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was mainly driven by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (200 bps). This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to lower overhead costs (70 bps), which were partially offset by increased advertising investment (30 bps).Operating profit in North America increased 5% in 2012 to $810, or 60 bps to 27.3% of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was driven by an increase in Gross profit, which was partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was driven by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, which were partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment.

Organic sales in Latin America increased 9.5% in 2013. Volume gains were led by Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and Central America. The increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2013 versus 2012 was driven by an increase in Oral Care sales, with the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories all contributing to growth. Personal Care also contributed to organic sales growth with gains in the bar soap category. Strong sales in the hand dish and fabric softener categories contributed to organic sales growth in Home Care.Net sales in Latin America increased 3.0% in 2012 to $5,032, driven by volume growth of 2.5% and net selling price increases of 6.5%, which were largely offset by negative foreign exchange of 6.0%.

This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit (110 bps) and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (10 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was due to higher costs (490 bps), primarily in Venezuela, which were partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (260 bps) and benefits of pricing as noted above. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was driven by increased advertising investment (10 bps).While Operating profit in Latin America increased 1% in 2012 to $1,454, it decreased 50 bps as a percentage of Net sales to 28.9%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Other (income) expense, net, which were partially offset by an increase in Gross profit, all as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was driven by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs, negative foreign exchange transaction costs and costs associated with the difficult economic and labor environment in Venezuela, which likewise impacted unit volume in that country. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to inflation and foreign exchange. 26(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Europe/South Pacific 2013 2012 % Change 2011 % ChangeNet sales$3,396 $3,417 (0.5)% $3,508 (2.5)%Operating profit$805 $747 8% $715 4%% of Net sales23.7% 21.9% 180bps 20.4% 150bpsNet sales in Europe/South Pacific decreased 0.5% in 2013 to $3,396, as volume growth of 1.5% and positive foreign exchange of 0.5% were more than offset by net selling price decreases of 2.5%.

The program’s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.The 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to produce significant benefits in the Company’s long-term business performance. The major objectives of the program include:▪Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the Company’s operations around the world. ▪Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions. ▪Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company’s gross and operating profit.▪Building on Colgate’s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth.Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program is projected to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,100 and $1,250 ($775 and $875 aftertax), which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (15%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (15%). Anticipated pretax charges for 2014 are expected to amount to approximately $275 to $325 ($200 to $230 aftertax). Over the course of the 2012 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe/South Pacific (20%), Latin America (5%), Asia (5%), Africa/Eurasia 30(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)(5%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (10%) and Corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is expected that by the end of 2016, the 2012 Restructuring Program will reduce the Company’s global employee workforce by approximately 6% from the 2012 level of approximately 38,000. Savings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $365 to $435 pretax ($275 to $325 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. Savings in 2014 should approximate $105 to $125 ($90 to $110 aftertax).Initiatives under the program are focused on the following three areas:▪Expanding Commercial Hubs - Building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continuing to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions - Implementing the Company’s shared service organizational model, already successful in Europe, in all regions of the world. Initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services will be expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions. ▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities - Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.

Since the inception of the 2012 Restructuring Program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has incurred pretax cumulative charges of $460 ($348 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows: Cumulative Charges as of December 31, 2013Employee-Related Costs$222Incremental Depreciation26Asset Impairments1Other211Total$460 31(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following projects: restructuring how the Company provides retirement benefits to its U.S.-based employees by shifting them from the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans to the Company’s defined contribution plan; the closing of the Morristown, New Jersey personal care facility; the simplification and streamlining of the Company’s research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain, both in Europe; other exit costs related to office consolidation; and the restructuring of certain commercial operations in advance of implementing an overall hubbing strategy.The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and implementation-related charges discussed above and the related accruals: Employee-RelatedCosts IncrementalDepreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Balance at January 1, 2012 $— $— $— $— $—Charges 78 — — 11 89Cash payments (1) — — (4) (5)Charges against assets — — — — —Foreign exchange 7 — — (2) 5Balance at December 31, 2012 $84 $— $— $5 $89Charges 144 26 1 200 371Cash payments (97) — — (72) (169)Charges against assets (17) (26) (1) — (44)Foreign exchange 2 — — — 2Other — — — (91) (91)Balance at December 31, 2013 $116 $— $— $42 $158Employee-related costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Employee-related costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $17 for the year ended December 31, 2013 which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-related costs in the preceding tables, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits). Incremental depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 included third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $50 and $8, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $34 and $3, respectively, directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2013 are other exit costs of $25 related to office space consolidation and a curtailment charge of $91 related to changes to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit retirement plans (see Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits).Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 is provided below. 32(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, effective tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and, as applicable, excluding the impacts of charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, the one-time charge resulting from the Venezuela devaluation, a charge for the competition law matter in France related to the home care and personal care sectors, a charge for the competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico, costs associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives and the gain on the sale of the non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for each of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2013OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America3.5%—%—%3.5%Latin America9.5%(9.5)%(0.5)%(0.5)%Europe/South Pacific(0.5)%0.5%(0.5)%(0.5)%Asia10.5%(1.5)%—%9.0%Africa/Eurasia7.0%(5.5)%—%1.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care6.0%(4.0)%—%2.0%Pet Nutrition5.0%(2.5)%—%2.5%Total Company6.0%(4.0)%—%2.0%Year ended December 31, 2012OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America3.5%—%—%3.5%Latin America10.5%(6.0)%(1.5)%3.0%Europe/South Pacific(0.5)%(5.0)%3.0%(2.5)%Asia12.0%(3.0)%—%9.0%Africa/Eurasia9.0%(7.0)%1.0%3.0%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care6.5%(4.5)%0.5%2.5%Pet Nutrition1.5%(2.0)%—%(0.5)%Total Company6.0%(4.0)%—%2.0% 33(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, costs related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations was $3,204 in 2013, compared to $3,196 in 2012 and $2,896 in 2011. Net cash provided by operations for 2013 increased as strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital were partially offset by higher cash spending related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. The increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to higher operating earnings, lower voluntary benefit plan contributions and decreased working capital, partially offset by higher income tax payments and payment of the fine in the previously disclosed French competition law matter. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was 0.7% in both 2013 and 2012. Approximately 75% of total projected program charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, currently estimated between $1,100 and $1,250 ($775 and $875 aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings are currently projected to be in the range of $365 to $435 ($275 to $325 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. The anticipated charges for 2014 are expected to amount to approximately $275 to $325 ($200 to $230 aftertax) and savings in 2014 should approximate $105 to $125 ($90 to $110 aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 Restructuring Program will be funded from operating cash flows. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2013 is expected to be paid before year end 2014.Investing activities used $890 of cash in 2013, compared to $865 and $1,213 during 2012 and 2011, respectively. Purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2013 to $505 from $545 in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in purchases of investments by the Company’s subsidiary in Venezuela of local currency denominated fixed interest rate bonds issued by the Venezuelan government, partially offset by an increase of the Company’s investments through other foreign subsidiaries. In 2012, the Company acquired the remaining interest in Tom’s of Maine for $18. In 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility are located. During 2011 and 2012, the Company received the first and second installments of $24 and $36, respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico. The final installment of $60 is due upon transfer of the property, which is expected to occur in 2014. In 2011, the Company also acquired the Sanex business for $966. The Company sold its non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia in 2011 for $215 ($135 aftertax gain). Capital expenditures were $670, $565 and $537 for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2014 are expected to remain at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales, which is higher than the historical rate of approximately 3.5% primarily due to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Financing activities used $2,142 of cash during 2013 compared to $2,301 and $1,242 during 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in cash used in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to a lower level of share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from exercises of stock options. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of debt, an increase in dividends paid in 2012, and higher share repurchase costs, partially offset by higher proceeds from exercises of stock options. Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $5,644 as of December 31, 2013, as compared to $5,176 as of December 31, 2012 and total debt increased to $5,657 as of December 31, 2013 as compared to $5,230 as of December 31, 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company issued $300 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.50% and $82 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. During the second quarter of 2013, the Company issued $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.90% and $400 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.10%. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.95% and during the second quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.30%. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company issued $300 of three-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.6%, $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.3% and $300 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.45%. During the second quarter of 2011, the Company issued $250 of three-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.25% and $250 of six-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.625%. The 34(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)debt issuances in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were U.S. dollar denominated and were under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings, which were used by the Company for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the debt issuance in the second quarter of 2013 were also used to repay and retire $250 of notes due in 2013. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and third quarters of 2012 and second quarter of 2011 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings, which were used by the Company for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2011 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings, which were used by the Company for general corporate purposes, and to repay outstanding indebtedness under a €408 credit facility.At December 31, 2013, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,444 (including under the two facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. This facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013 and will expire in November 2018. The Company also has the ability to draw $145 from a revolving credit facility that expires in November 2014. Commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $0 and $443 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2013 and 2012 were $1,736 and $1,562, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in 2018.The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2013 and 2012: 2013 2012 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities OutstandingPayable to banks 2.2% 2014 $13 1.0% 2013 $54Commercial paper — 0.1% 2013 443Total $13 $497Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.On March 7, 2013, the Board approved a two-for-one stock split of the Company’s common stock to be effected through a 100% stock dividend (the “2013 Stock Split”). The record date for the two-for-one stock split was the close of business on April 23, 2013 and the share distribution occurred on May 15, 2013. The Board authorized that the number of shares remaining under the 2011 Program (defined below) as of May 15, 2013 be increased by 100% as a result of the two-for-one stock split. All per share amounts and numbers of shares outstanding in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on a post-split basis. Refer to Note 8, Capital Stock and Stock-Based Compensation Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Dividend payments in 2013 were $1,382, an increase from $1,277 in 2012 and $1,203 in 2011. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.33 per share in 2013 from $1.22 per share in 2012 and $1.14 per share in 2011. In the first quarter of 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.34 per share from $0.31 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2013. The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. The share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors on September 8, 2011 (the “2011 Program”) authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs. 35(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Aggregate share repurchases in 2013, adjusted for the 2013 Stock Split, consisted of 24.6 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,521. Aggregate repurchases in 2012, adjusted for the 2013 Stock Split, consisted of 37.6 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,943. Aggregate repurchases in 2011, adjusted for the 2013 Stock Split, consisted of 40.8 million common shares under both the 2011 Program and a previously authorized repurchase program, and 1.8 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,806.Cash and cash equivalents increased $78 during 2013 to $962 at December 31, 2013, compared to $884 at December 31, 2012, most of which ($865 and $861, respectively) were held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. These amounts include $114 and $170 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which are subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings.As of December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately $4,700 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the Company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings. These earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, therefore, are not subject to such taxes. Should these earnings be repatriated in the future, they would be subject to applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes. Determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable.The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013: Payments Due by Period Total 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion $5,644 $895 $491 $255 $664 $695 $2,644Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(1) 564 90 81 66 62 44 221Leases 1,102 196 172 138 126 121 349Purchase obligations(2) 800 530 143 119 8 — —Total $8,110 $1,711 $887 $578 $860 $860 $3,214_______(1) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(2) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2013 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2014. Management does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2014. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2014 from the Company’s assets is estimated to be approximately $98.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 36(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, Venezuela), inventories, prepaid expenses, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward, option and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $5 and $1 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2013, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $33.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates. 37(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Based on year-end 2013 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $5 in 2013.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tallow, tropical oils, poultry, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized gains of $0 and $1 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. At the end of 2013, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11 “Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.” The new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and interim periods within those years. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in Cost of sales, Gross profit margin would have decreased by 750 bps, from 58.6% to 51.1% in 2013 and decreased by 740 bps and 750 bps in 2012 and 2011, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2013, 2012 or 2011 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. 38(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.▪In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 4.96%, 4.14% and 4.90% as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.24%, 4.32% and 5.26% as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plans. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 6.80% as of December 31, 2013, 7.30% as of December 31, 2012 and 7.75% as of December 31, 2011. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return.Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 9%, 11%, 7%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53% in fixed income securities, 27% in equity securities and 20% in real estate and other investments. As the funded status of the plans improved in 2013, the Company reallocated a portion of the assets of the U.S. plans from equity securities to fixed income securities and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $11. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $3. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2013, 3.50% as of December 31, 2012 and 4.00% as of December 31, 2011. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 7.0% for 2014, declining to 5.0% by 2020 and remaining at 5.0% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $6.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $7.41. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include the expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 8%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%.▪Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. The asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. Qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. 39(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition in 2011, which were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded book value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values. Asset impairment analysis related to the fixed assets of the Company’s subsidiary in Venezuela requires management’s best estimate of future exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the bolivar fuerte, the rate of inflation in Venezuela and the timing and amount of future selling price increases for products sold in Venezuela.▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2015,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive Overview and OutlookColgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. Approximately 80% of the Company’s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with over 50% of the Company’s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is operated through five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific, Asia and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians.On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products.The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses and distribution and logistics, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. 17(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)As discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” with approximately 80% of its Net sales generated outside the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. For example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in Venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations, high inflation and the decline in the price of oil, and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. Price controls, which became effective in April 2012, affect most products in the portfolio of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary (“CP Venezuela”) and restrict the Company’s ability to implement price increases without government approval, which has limited the Company’s ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations. In particular, the Company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in February 2013, and the effective devaluations that have occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multi-tier foreign exchange system implemented during the first quarter of 2014. In addition, the decline in the price of oil may result in a reduced availability of U.S. dollars to fund CP Venezuela’s imports.During the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted several changes to Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime, introducing a multi-tier foreign exchange system creating three exchange rate mechanisms available to convert Venezuelan bolivares to U.S. dollars. Although the official exchange rate, as determined by the National Center for Foreign Commerce (“CENCOEX”), remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar, the exchange rate for foreign investments moved to the rate available on the SICAD I (Supplementary System for the Administration of Foreign Currency) currency market. The Venezuelan government also introduced an alternative currency market known as SICAD II. The Company remeasures the financial statements of CP Venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, is the SICAD I rate. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred net pretax losses of $327 ($214 aftertax losses or $0.23 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end SICAD I rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014. The SICAD I rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and remained at 12.00 bolivares per dollar as of December 31, 2014. Included in the net remeasurement losses during 2014 were charges related to the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government and held by CP Venezuela. Because the official exchange rate remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar, the devaluation-protected bonds did not revalue at the rate available on the SICAD I currency market but remained at the official exchange rate which resulted in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds. The net remeasurement losses incurred in 2014 are referred to as the “2014 Venezuela Remeasurements.”There continue to be ongoing impacts primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements and, to a lesser degree, the import of materials at the SICAD I exchange rate as some imports may still qualify for the official rate. Because the SICAD I market is auction-based and auctions are held periodically during each quarter, the exchange rate available through SICAD I may vary throughout the year which would cause additional remeasurements of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets and further impact CP Venezuela’s ongoing results.CP Venezuela continues to be able to settle certain of its U.S. dollar obligations for imported materials at the official rate of 6.30 bolivares per dollar and records the gains related to such transactions when the funds are authorized by CENCOEX and the liabilities are paid. As part of the announcements during the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government also issued a new Law on Fair Pricing, establishing a maximum profit margin of 30%. The new law does not apply to products that are subject to price controls, which includes most of the products in CP Venezuela’s portfolio. During the third quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government approved price increases for the majority of CP Venezuela’s product portfolio, which were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014. 18(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company incurred a pretax loss of $172 ($111 aftertax loss or $0.12 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the date of the devaluation that changed the official exchange rate from 4.30 to 6.30 bolivares per dollar (the “2013 Venezuela Remeasurement”). The 2014 Venezuela Remeasurements and the 2013 Venezuela Remeasurement are referred to together as the “Venezuela Remeasurements.”CP Venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods through a combination of U.S. dollars obtained from CENCOEX and intercompany borrowings. CP Venezuela’s supply of U.S. dollars to fund imports has been limited and sporadic. CP Venezuela was invited to participate in the SICAD I currency market during the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and received less than $1 in each of those quarters at a rate of 10.50 bolivares per dollar and 12.00 bolivares per dollar, respectively. Although accessible to the Company, the Company did not participate in the SICAD II currency market during 2014. CP Venezuela’s difficulty in accessing U.S. dollars to support its operations has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the business. Additionally, at times, production at CP Venezuela has also been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country.For the year ended December 31, 2014, CP Venezuela represented approximately 3% of the Company’s consolidated Net sales and approximately 1% of the Company’s consolidated Operating profit excluding the impacts of the 2014 Venezuela Remeasurements, charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and certain European competition law matters and the sale of land in Mexico (discussed below). At December 31, 2014, CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary asset position, which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of further changes in the SICAD I rate, was $549. This amount includes the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated non-monetary assets were $310 at December 31, 2014 and included $235 of fixed assets that could be subject to impairment if CP Venezuela is not able to implement further price increases to offset the impacts of continued high inflation or further devaluations, or if it does not have sufficient access to U.S. dollars to fund imports. In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime. While the official exchange rate, as determined by CENCOEX, remains at 6.30 bolivares per dollar and the SICAD I market (now known as SICAD) is unchanged and the rate currently remains at 12.00 bolivares per dollar, the SICAD II market, discussed above, has been eliminated and a new, alternative currency market, the Foreign Exchange Marginal System (“SIMADI”), has been created with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants. The SIMADI market became operational with an initial exchange rate of 170.04 bolivares per dollar. While the Company will continue to assess the impact, if any, of these changes as the government of Venezuela issues regulations to implement them, if CP Venezuela is unable to obtain sufficient U.S. dollars from CENCOEX or the SICAD market to fund its requirements for imported goods and instead needs to access the SIMADI market, it could significantly impact the Company’s operations in Venezuela. The Company continues to actively manage its investment in and limit its exposure to Venezuela. The Company’s business in Venezuela, and the Company’s ability to repatriate its earnings, continue to be negatively affected by the difficult conditions described above. Additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange, pricing, payments, profits or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest would further negatively affect the Company’s business in Venezuela and the Company’s ability to effectively make key operational decisions in regard to its Venezuelan operations, both of which could result in an impairment of the Company’s investment in CP Venezuela. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s total investment in CP Venezuela was $955, which included intercompany payables of CP Venezuela. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program for sustained growth. The program’s initiatives are expected to help the Company ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. 19(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On October 23, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program (as expanded, the “2012 Restructuring Program”). The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas: ▪Expanding Commercial Hubs ▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities The Board authorized the expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas. Cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2016. Savings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be approximately $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $208, $278 and $70, respectively, associated with the 2012 Restructuring Program. For more information regarding the 2012 Restructuring Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below. On September 13, 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the United States of America (the “Purchaser”) the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. The sale price is payable in three installments, with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property, which is subject to the Company’s satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by March 20, 2015. While these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by March 20, 2015, in which case the Purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments), based on the transaction to date, the Company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015. The Company has reinvested the first two installments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility at its Mission Hills, Mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within Mexico City and to prepare the existing site for transfer. Exit costs incurred during the project primarily relate to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready.In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $3, $12 and $18, respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico and, in 2012, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $14 associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives.Looking forward, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. While the global marketplace in which the Company operates has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from local competitors and other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the Company does. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. Additionally, the Company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs, driven by foreign exchange transaction costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results.The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brand names, its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives, such as the 2012 Restructuring Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long term. 20(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of OperationsNet SalesWorldwide Net sales were $17,277 in 2014, down 1.0% from 2013, as volume growth of 3.0% and net selling price increases of 2.0% were more than offset by negative foreign exchange of 6.0%. Organic sales (Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure as discussed below, increased 5.0% in 2014.Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment were $15,022 in 2014, down 1.0% from 2013, as volume growth of 3.5% and net selling price increases of 1.5% were more than offset by negative foreign exchange of 6.0%. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment increased 5.0% in 2014.The increase in organic sales in 2014 versus 2013 was driven by an increase in Oral Care organic sales, with the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories all contributing to growth. Personal Care and Home Care also contributed to organic sales growth due to strong organic sales in the bar soap and the fabric softener categories, respectively. The Company’s share of the global toothpaste market was 44.4% for full year 2014 and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 33.4% for full year 2014. Full year 2014 market shares in toothpaste were up in Europe/South Pacific and Africa/Eurasia and down in North America, Latin America and Asia versus full year 2013. In the manual toothbrush category, full year 2014 market shares were up in North America, Europe/South Pacific and Asia and down in Latin America and Africa/Eurasia versus full year 2013. For additional information regarding market shares, see “Market Share Information” below.Net sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 2.0% in 2014 to $2,255, as volume growth of 1.0% and net selling price increases of 3.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 2.0%. Organic sales for Hill’s Pet Nutrition increased 4.0% in 2014.The increase in organic sales in 2014 versus 2013 was driven by continued growth in the Prescription Diet category. The Advanced Nutrition and Naturals categories also contributed to organic sales growth.Worldwide Net sales were $17,420 in 2013, up 2.0% from 2012, as volume growth of 5.0% and net selling price increases of 1.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 4.0%. Organic sales increased 6.0% in 2013. 21(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Gross Profit/MarginWorldwide Gross profit decreased 1% to $10,109 in 2014 from $10,201 in 2013. Gross profit in both periods included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and costs related to the sale of land in Mexico. Excluding these items in both periods, Gross profit decreased to $10,142 in 2014 from $10,248 in 2013, primarily due to lower sales ($84), as the growth in organic sales was more than offset by the impact of negative foreign exchange, and lower Gross profit margin ($22).Worldwide Gross profit margin decreased to 58.5% in 2014 from 58.6% in 2013. Excluding the items described above in both periods, Gross profit margin decreased by 10 basis points (bps) to 58.7% in 2014 from 58.8% in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (290 bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs, which were largely offset by the benefits from cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (200 bps), higher pricing (70 bps) and cost savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program (20 bps).Worldwide Gross profit increased 3% to $10,201 in 2013 from $9,932 in 2012. Gross profit in both periods included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and costs related to the sale of land in Mexico. Gross profit in 2012 also included costs associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives. Excluding these items in both periods as applicable, Gross profit increased to $10,248 in 2013 from $9,963 in 2012, primarily due to sales growth ($195) and Gross profit margin expansion ($90).Worldwide Gross profit margin increased to 58.6% in 2013 from 58.1% in 2012. Excluding the items described above in both periods as applicable, Gross profit margin increased by 50 bps to 58.8% in 2013. The increase was primarily due to cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (220 bps) and higher pricing (30 bps), which were partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (210 bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs. 2014 2013 2012Gross profit, GAAP $10,109 $10,201 $9,9322012 Restructuring Program 29 32 2Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico 4 15 24Business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives — — 5Gross profit, non-GAAP $10,142 $10,248 $9,963 2014 2013 Basis Point Change 2012 Basis Point ChangeGross profit margin, GAAP 58.5% 58.6% (10) 58.1% 502012 Restructuring Program 0.2 0.2 — — Costs related to the sale of land in Mexico — — — 0.2 Business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives — — — — Gross profit margin, non-GAAP 58.7% 58.8% (10) 58.3% 50 22(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% to $5,982 in 2014 from $6,223 in 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses in both periods included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Excluding these charges in both periods, Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $5,920 in 2014 from $6,086 in 2013, reflecting decreased advertising investment of $107 and lower overhead expenses of $59.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales decreased to 34.6% in 2014 from 35.7% in 2013. Excluding charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program in both periods, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 34.3%, a decrease of 60 bps as compared to 2013. This decrease in 2014 was primarily driven by decreased advertising investment as a percentage of Net sales (60 bps). In 2014, advertising investment decreased 5.7% to $1,784 as compared with $1,891 in 2013 and decreased as a percentage of Net sales to 10.3% from 10.9% in 2013.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% to $6,223 in 2013 from $5,930 in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses in both periods included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012 also included costs associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives. Excluding these items in both periods as applicable, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $6,086 in 2013 from $5,910 in 2012, reflecting increased advertising investment of $99 and higher overhead expenses of $77.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased to 35.7% in 2013 from 34.7% in 2012.

The major objectives of the program include:▪Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the Company’s operations around the world. ▪Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions. ▪Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company’s gross and operating profit.▪Building on Colgate’s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth.On October 23, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program. The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas: ▪Expanding Commercial Hubs - Building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continuing to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions - Implementing the Company’s shared service organizational model, already successful in Europe, in all regions of the world. Initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services will be expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions. ▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities - Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market. The Board authorized the expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas. Cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2016. These pretax charges are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (10%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). Anticipated pretax charges for 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $330 to $385 ($245 to $285 aftertax). Over the course of the 2012 Restructuring Program, it is currently estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. 34(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe/South Pacific (20%), Latin America (5%), Asia (5%), Africa/Eurasia (5%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (10%) and Corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is expected that, by the end of 2016, the 2012 Restructuring Program will contribute a net reduction of approximately 2,000-2,500 positions from the Company’s global employee workforce. Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. Savings in 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $80 to $100 pretax ($60 to $75 aftertax).For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: 2014 2013 2012Cost of sales $29 $32 $2Selling, general and administrative expenses 62 137 6Other (income) expense, net 195 202 81Total 2012 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $286 $371 $89 Total 2012 Restructuring Program charges, aftertax $208 $278 $70Restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

Employee-Related Costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $5, $17 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding tables, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 included third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $65, $50 and $8, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $40, $34 and $3, respectively, directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are other exit costs of $82 and $25, respectively, related to the consolidation of facilities. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2013 also included a curtailment charge of $91 related to changes to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit retirement plans (see Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is provided below.Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, effective tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and, as applicable, excluding charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, charges related to the Venezuela Remeasurements, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico, charges for European competition law matters, a charge for a foreign tax matter and costs associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. 37(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2014OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America2.5%(1.0)%—%1.5%Latin America9.0%(14.5)%0.5%(5.0)%Europe/South Pacific1.5%(0.5)%(0.5)%0.5%Asia4.5%(3.0)%—%1.5%Africa/Eurasia7.0%(11.0)%—%(4.0)%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care5.0%(6.0)%—%(1.0)%Pet Nutrition4.0%(2.0)%—%2.0%Total Company5.0%(6.0)%—%(1.0)%Year ended December 31, 2013OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America3.5%—%—%3.5%Latin America9.5%(9.5)%(0.5)%(0.5)%Europe/South Pacific(0.5)%0.5%(0.5)%(0.5)%Asia10.5%(1.5)%—%9.0%Africa/Eurasia7.0%(5.5)%—%1.5%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care6.0%(4.0)%—%2.0%Pet Nutrition5.0%(2.5)%—%2.5%Total Company6.0%(4.0)%—%2.0% 38(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, costs related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations was $3,298 in 2014, compared to $3,204 in 2013 and $3,196 in 2012. Net cash provided by operations for 2014 increased due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital. The increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital, partially offset by higher cash spending related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was 0.8% and 0.7% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Approximately 75% of total program charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 pretax ($950 to $1,050 aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. The anticipated pretax charges for 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $330 to $385 ($245 to $285 aftertax) and savings in 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $80 to $100 pretax ($60 to $75 aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 Restructuring Program will be funded from operating cash flows. Approximately 60% of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2014 is expected to be paid before year end 2015.Investing activities used $859 of cash in 2014, compared to $890 and $865 during 2013 and 2012, respectively. Purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2014 to $340 from $505 in 2013 partially due to a decrease in purchases of investments by the Company’s subsidiary in Venezuela of local currency-denominated fixed interest rate bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. In 2012, the Company acquired the remaining interest in Tom’s of Maine for $18. In 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. During 2011 and 2012, the Company received the first and second installments of $24 and $36, respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico. The final installment of $60 is due upon transfer of the property, which is subject to the Company’s satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by March 20, 2015. While these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by March 20, 2015, in which case the Purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments), based on the transaction to date, the Company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015. Capital expenditures were $757, $670 and $565 for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to remain at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales, which is higher than the historical rate of approximately 3.5% primarily due to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Financing activities used $2,170 of cash during 2014 compared to $2,142 and $2,301 during 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt and higher dividends paid, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. The decrease in cash used in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to a lower level of share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from exercises of stock options. 39(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $6,132 as of December 31, 2014, as compared to $5,644 as of December 31, 2013 and total debt increased to $6,148 as of December 31, 2014 as compared to $5,657 as of December 31, 2013. The Company’s debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company issued $134 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. During the first quarter of 2014, the Company issued $500 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.75% and $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.25%. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company issued $300 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.50% and $82 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. During the second quarter of 2013, the Company issued $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.90% and $400 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.10%. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.95% and during the second quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.30%. The debt issuances in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were U.S. dollar denominated and were under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the first and fourth quarters of 2014 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. Proceeds from the debt issuance in the first quarter of 2014 were also used to repay and retire $250 of U.S. dollar denominated notes and €250 of euro denominated notes, both of which became due in the second quarter of 2014. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. Proceeds from the debt issuance in the second quarter of 2013 were also used to repay and retire $250 of notes due in 2013. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and third quarters of 2012 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2014, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,001 (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. This facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013. In 2014, the Company entered into an amendment of this facility whereby the facility was extended for an additional year to November 2019 and the capacity of the facility was increased to $2,370. The Company also has the ability to draw $165 from a revolving credit facility that expires in November 2015. In addition, the Company has the ability to draw $20 from a new credit facility entered into during 2014, which expires in December 2015. Commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $255 and $0 as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2014 and 2013 were $1,486 and $1,736, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in November 2019.The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2014 and 2013: 2014 2013 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities OutstandingPayable to banks 1.9% 2015 $16 2.2% 2014 $13Commercial paper —% 2015 255 —Total $271 $13Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2014 were $1,446, an increase from $1,382 in 2013 and $1,277 in 2012. Dividend payments increased to $1.42 per share in 2014 from $1.33 per share in 2013 and $1.22 per share in 2012. In the first quarter of 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.36 per share from $0.34 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2014. 40(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. The share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors on September 8, 2011 (the “2011 Program”) authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The Board authorized that the number of shares remaining under the 2011 Program as of May 15, 2013 be increased by 100% as a result of the two-for-one stock split of the Company’s common stock in 2013. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs.On February 19, 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under a new share repurchase program (the “2015 Program”), which replaced the 2011 Program. The Company will commence repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2015 Program after February 19, 2015.Aggregate share repurchases in 2014 consisted of 21.7 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.5 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,530. Aggregate repurchases in 2013 consisted of 24.6 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,521. Aggregate repurchases in 2012 consisted of 37.6 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,943.Cash and cash equivalents increased $127 during 2014 to $1,089 at December 31, 2014, compared to $962 at December 31, 2013, most of which ($1,034 and $865, respectively) were held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. These amounts include $64 and $114 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which are subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings.As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $4,900 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the Company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings. These earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, therefore, are not subject to such taxes. Should these earnings be repatriated in the future, they would be subject to applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes. As the Company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014: Payments Due by Period Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion $6,132 $743 $263 $660 $697 $498 $3,271Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(1) 398 59 51 35 35 41 177Leases 1,063 201 170 148 138 126 280Purchase obligations(2) 774 500 140 99 35 — —Total $8,367 $1,503 $624 $942 $905 $665 $3,728_______(1) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(2) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2014 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. 41(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2015. Management also does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2015. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2015 from the Company’s assets is estimated to be approximately $69.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, Venezuela), local currency-denominated non-monetary assets including inventories, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company. 42(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $22 and $5 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2014, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $29.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2014 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $10 in 2014.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized gains of $1 and $0 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At the end of 2014, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsOn May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. The standard, issued as Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” by the FASB, provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with no early adoption permitted. The standard allows for either “full retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or “modified retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 43(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) On April 10, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08 “Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.” ASU No. 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2015. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in Cost of sales, Gross profit margin would have decreased by 770 bps, from 58.5% to 50.8% in 2014 and decreased by 750 bps and 740 bps in 2013 and 2012, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2014, 2013 or 2012 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.▪In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 4.24%, 4.96% and 4.14% as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 4.36%, 5.24% and 4.32% as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 6.80% as of December 31, 2014, 6.80% as of December 31, 2013 and 7.30% as of December 31, 2012. As the funded status of the U.S. postretirement plans improved in 2013, the Company reallocated a portion of the assets of those plans from equity securities to fixed income securities and other investments. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return. 44(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 11%, 10%, 7%, 5%, and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53% in fixed income securities, 27% in equity securities and 20% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $11. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $4. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 7.0% for 2015, declining to 5.0% by 2021 and remaining at 5.0% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $7.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2014 was $7.60. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 8%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 7%.▪Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. The asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. Qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.The estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition in 2011, which were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values. Asset impairment analysis related to the fixed assets of the Company’s subsidiary in Venezuela requires management’s best estimate of future exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Venezuelan bolivares, the rate of inflation in Venezuela, the timing and amount of future selling price increases for products sold in Venezuela, whether the Company has sufficient access to U.S. dollars to fund imports. 45(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data. Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. We believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors. 46(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings growth, financial goals, the impact of currency devaluations and exchange controls, price or profit controls and labor unrest, including in Venezuela, cost-reduction plans including the 2012 Restructuring Program, tax rates, new product introductions, commercial investment levels or legal proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain economic environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, the ability to implement the 2012 Restructuring Program as planned or differences between the actual and the estimated costs or savings under such program, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the ability to continue lowering costs and the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit. For information about these and other factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.” 47ITEM 7A.

21665,CL,COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,2016,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive Overview and OutlookColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “Colgate”) seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. Approximately 75% of the Company’s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with over 50% of the Company’s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is operated through five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific, Asia and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians.On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products.The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. 17(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)As discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” with approximately 75% of its Net sales generated outside the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. For example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in Venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations in 2010 and 2013 and effective devaluations in 2014 and 2015, high inflation and a precipitous decline in the price of oil, and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. Increasingly, the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary (“CP Venezuela”) has experienced various production interruptions due to material shortages caused by limited access to U.S. dollars for imported materials, delays in the importation process due to regulations and controls imposed by the Venezuelan government, labor unrest and high costs due to inflation coupled with the inability to increase prices without government approval. Price controls, which became effective in April 2012, affect the majority of products in CP Venezuela’s portfolio and restrict the Company’s ability to implement price increases without government approval, which has limited the Company’s ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations. In addition, during the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government issued the Law on Fair Pricing, establishing a maximum profit margin of 30% for products and services. CP Venezuela’s business is reliant on imported materials and products and it cannot maintain regular operations without sufficient access to U.S. dollars which is controlled by the government. In February 2015, the Venezuelan government implemented changes in Venezuela’s foreign exchange regime. While the official exchange rate, as determined by the National Center for Foreign Commerce (“CENCOEX”), remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar and the SICAD I (Supplementary System for the Administration of Foreign Currency) currency market, now known as SICAD, was unchanged, the SICAD II market was eliminated and a new, alternative currency market, the Foreign Exchange Marginal System (“SIMADI”), was created and became operational with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants. CP Venezuela has funded its requirements for imported goods through a combination of U.S. dollars obtained from CENCOEX and intercompany borrowings. Although access to U.S. dollars in Venezuela has been challenging, because the majority of the products in CP Venezuela’s portfolio have been designated as “essential” by the Venezuelan government, historically CP Venezuela’s access to U.S. dollars at the official rate of 6.30 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its U.S. dollar obligations for imported goods. However, CP Venezuela’s access to U.S. dollars to fund imports became increasingly more limited and sporadic in 2015 and deteriorated even further during the fourth quarter of 2015. Although the SIMADI market has been accessible to CP Venezuela, it did not participate in that market through December 31, 2015. Since its inception, the volume of transactions in the SIMADI market as a whole has been very limited, and the SIMADI exchange rate at December 31, 2015 was 198.70 bolivares per dollar. Since the majority of CP Venezuela’s product portfolio is subject to price controls, it could not operate profitably without substantial price increases approved by the government if it had to pay for imported materials with U.S. dollars obtained from the SIMADI market.The Company’s business in Venezuela and the Company’s ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions. The restrictive exchange control regulations in Venezuela and CP Venezuela’s increasingly limited access to U.S. dollars have resulted in an ‘other-than-temporary’ lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and the U.S. dollar. This lack of exchangeability, together with other government controls on pricing, payments, profits and imports and restrictive labor laws, have significantly impacted the Company’s ability to make key operational decisions over its business in Venezuela, including the ability to manage its capital structure, material sourcing, product pricing and labor relations. The Company expects these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, effective December 31, 2015, the Company concluded it no longer meets the accounting criteria for consolidation of CP Venezuela and began accounting for CP Venezuela using the cost method of accounting. As a result, the Company recorded an aftertax charge of $1,058 ($1,084 pretax) or $1.16 per diluted share in 2015. The charge primarily consists of an impairment of the Company’s investment in CP Venezuela of $952, which includes intercompany receivables from CP Venezuela, and $111 related to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses. 18(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Effective December 31, 2015, CP Venezuela’s net assets, which include $75 and $394 of cash and government bonds, respectively, are no longer included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. CP Venezuela’s Net sales, Operating profit and Net income through December 31, 2015 are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, CP Venezuela represented approximately 4% of the Company’s consolidated Net sales and approximately 2% of the Company’s consolidated Operating profit, excluding the impacts of charges related to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, the 2015 Venezuela Remeasurements (as defined below), a foreign competition law matter and the 2012 Restructuring Program and a gain on the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific.In future periods, under the cost method of accounting, the Company will no longer include the results of CP Venezuela in its Consolidated Financial Statements and will include income relating to its Venezuelan operations only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to CP Venezuela or for dividends or royalties remitted by CP Venezuela. Although CP Venezuela’s local operating results will no longer be included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting purposes, under current tax rules, the Company is required to continue including CP Venezuela in its consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Colgate has been operating in Venezuela for 72 years and the Company expects its operations in Venezuela to continue to provide Venezuelan consumers with the Company’s market leading brands. Prior to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, which was effective December 31, 2015, the Company remeasured the financial statements of CP Venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expected to remit future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, was the SICAD rate. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred pretax losses of $34 ($22 aftertax or $0.02 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end SICAD rate. The quarter-end SICAD rate was 12.00 bolivares per dollar, 12.80 bolivares per dollar, 13.50 bolivares per dollar and 13.50 bolivares per dollar as of the end of the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The remeasurement losses incurred in the second and third quarters of 2015 are referred to as the “2015 Venezuela Remeasurements.”During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred net pretax losses of $327 ($214 aftertax or $0.23 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end SICAD I rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014 (the “2014 Venezuela Remeasurements”). The SICAD I rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and remained at 12.00 bolivares per dollar as of December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company incurred a pretax loss of $172 ($111 aftertax or $0.12 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela’s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the date of the devaluation that changed the official exchange rate from 4.30 to 6.30 bolivares per dollar (the “2013 Venezuela Remeasurement”). The 2015 Venezuela Remeasurements, 2014 Venezuela Remeasurements and 2013 Venezuela Remeasurement are referred to together as the “Venezuela Remeasurements.”Included in the remeasurement losses during 2015 and 2014 were charges related to the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government and held by CP Venezuela. Because the official exchange rate remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar, the devaluation-protected bonds did not revalue at the SICAD rate but remained at the official exchange rate which resulted in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds. 19(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program for sustained growth. The program’s initiatives are expected to help the Company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.On October 23, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an expansion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program (as expanded, the “2012 Restructuring Program”). The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas: ▪Expanding Commercial Hubs ▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities The Board authorized the expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas. Cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax), exclusive of the expansion approved in October 2015 (discussed below). Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be approximately $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the end of the fourth year of the program, exclusive of the expansion approved in October 2015. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $183, $208 and $278, respectively, associated with the 2012 Restructuring Program. On October 29, 2015, recognizing the macroeconomic challenges around the world and the Company’s successful implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program to date, the Company’s Board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific (discussed below) to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program and extend it for one year through December 31, 2017. Initiatives under the expanded 2012 Restructuring Program will continue to fit within the program’s three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. The Company expects the initiatives under the expanded program to have a similar aftertax rate of return to the existing program, which on average has been 30%. The Company will update its disclosure to reflect the impact the expansion will have on the range of estimated charges and savings for the 2012 Restructuring Program when the additional initiatives under the expanded program are approved. For more information regarding the 2012 Restructuring Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below.In August 2015, the Company completed the sale of its laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 310 Australian dollars ($221) and recorded a pretax gain of $187 ($120 aftertax or $0.13 per diluted share) in Other (income) expense, net. The gain is net of charges related to the right-sizing of the Company’s South Pacific business, asset write-offs related to the divested laundry detergent business and other costs related to the sale. As discussed above, the funds from the sale will be reinvested to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program. 20(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On September 13, 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the United States of America (the “Purchaser”) the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. The parties have subsequently amended the agreement to extend the closing date. Under the existing agreement, the final installment of the purchase price is due upon the transfer of the property, which is subject to the Company’s satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by February 29, 2016. If these conditions are not fully satisfied by such date, the agreement will automatically be extended to March 30, 2016. While these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by March 30, 2016, in which case the Purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installments of the purchase price), based on the discussions to date, the Company believes that an additional amendment will be negotiated and the transfer of the property is expected to occur by the third quarter of 2016. The Company has reinvested the first two installments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility at its Mission Hills, Mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within Mexico City and to prepare the existing site for transfer. Exit costs incurred during the project primarily relate to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $0, $3 and $12, respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico.Looking forward, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. While the global marketplace in which the Company operates has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the Company does. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. Additionally, the Company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs, driven by foreign exchange transaction costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results.The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brands, its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives, such as the 2012 Restructuring Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long term. 21(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Results of OperationsNet SalesWorldwide Net sales were $16,034 in 2015, down 7.0% from 2014, as volume growth of 1.5% and net selling price increases of 3.0% were more than offset by negative foreign exchange of 11.5%.

The charge for a foreign tax matter in 2015 relates to several Supreme Court rulings in a foreign jurisdiction disallowing certain tax deductions which had the effect of reversing prior decisions. The Company had taken deductions in prior years similar to those now disallowed by the Court. As a result, as required, the Company reassessed its tax position in light of the recent rulings and concluded it needed to increase its unrecognized tax benefits by $15. The charge of $66 for a foreign tax matter in 2014 relates to a notice of an adverse decision in a foreign court regarding a tax position taken in prior years. As a result, as required, the Company reassessed its tax position in light of the decision and concluded it needed to increase its unrecognized tax benefits by $30 and write off a $36 deferred tax asset. The effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the Company’s global business initiatives. 27(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Net Income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share, dilutedNet income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company was $1,384, or $1.52 per share on a diluted basis, in 2015 compared to $2,180, or $2.36 per share on a diluted basis, in 2014 and $2,241, or $2.38 per share on a diluted basis, in 2013.

Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was even with 2014, as cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (240 bps) and the 2012 Restructuring Program (60 bps) were offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (220 bps), driven by foreign exchange transaction costs, and lower pricing due to increased promotional activities. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment (60 bps), in part reflecting a shift from advertising investment to in-store promotional activities, which was partially offset by higher overhead expenses (20 bps).Operating profit in Europe/South Pacific increased 9% in 2014 to $877, or 200 bps to 25.7% of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Gross profit (170 bps) and a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was driven by cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (190 bps) and the 2012 Restructuring Program (70 bps), which more than offset higher raw and packaging material costs (20 bps) and lower pricing due to increased promotional activities. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased advertising investment (50 bps), which was partially offset by higher overhead expenses (20 bps). 31(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Asia 2015 2014 % Change 2013 % ChangeNet sales$2,478 $2,515 (1.5)% $2,472 1.5%Operating profit$753 $736 2% $698 5%% of Net sales30.4% 29.3% 110bps 28.2% 110bpsNet sales in Asia decreased 1.5% in 2015 to $2,478, as volume growth of 4.0% was more than offset by net selling price decreases of 1.0% and negative foreign exchange of 4.5%.

This increase in Gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (200 bps) and higher pricing, partially offset by higher costs (220 bps), primarily driven by higher raw and packaging material costs, which included higher foreign exchange transaction costs. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased advertising investment (170 bps).

The program’s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.The 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to produce significant benefits in the Company’s long-term business performance. The major objectives of the program include:▪Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the Company’s operations around the world. ▪Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions. ▪Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company’s gross and operating profit.▪Building on Colgate’s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth.On October 23, 2014, the Company’s Board approved an expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program. The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas: ▪Expanding Commercial Hubs - Building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continuing to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision-making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.▪Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions - Implementing the Company’s shared service organizational model, already successful in Europe, in all regions of the world. Initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services will be expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions. ▪Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities - Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market. The Board authorized the expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas. On October 29, 2015, the Company’s Board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program and extend it for one year through December 31, 2017. Initiatives under the expanded 2012 Restructuring Program will continue to fit within the program’s three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. The Company expects the initiatives under the expanded program to have a similar aftertax rate of return to the existing program, which on average has been 30%. The Company will update its disclosure to reflect the impact the expansion will have on the range of estimated charges and savings for the 2012 Restructuring Program when the additional initiatives under the expanded program are approved. The charges and savings discussed below do not reflect the impact of this expansion. 35(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). These pretax charges are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (10%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). Over the course of the 2012 Restructuring Program, it is currently estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Anticipated pretax charges for 2016 are expected to amount to approximately $285 to $435 ($210 to $310 aftertax). It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe/South Pacific (20%), Latin America (5%), Asia (5%), Africa/Eurasia (5%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (10%) and Corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is now expected that, by the end of 2016, the 2012 Restructuring Program will have contributed a net reduction of approximately 2,700-3,200 positions from the Company’s global employee workforce. Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. Savings in 2016 are expected to amount to approximately $60 to $70 pretax ($55 to $65 aftertax). For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: 2015 2014 2013Cost of sales $20 $29 $32Selling, general and administrative expenses 64 62 137Other (income) expense, net 170 195 202Total 2012 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $254 $286 $371 Total 2012 Restructuring Program charges, aftertax $183 $208 $278Restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

Employee-Related Costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $17, $5 and $17 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding tables, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $65, $65 and $50, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $8, $40 and $34, respectively, directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are other exit costs of $47, $82 and $25, respectively, related to the consolidation of facilities. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2013 also included a curtailment charge of $91 related to changes to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit retirement plans (see Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is provided below.Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and, as applicable, excluding a charge related to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, charges related to the Venezuela Remeasurements, a gain on the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific, charges for foreign tax matters, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico and charges for foreign competition law matters (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. 38(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 versus the prior year:Year ended December 31, 2015OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America2.0%(1.0)%—%1.0%Latin America9.5%(19.0)%—%(9.5)%Europe/South Pacific1.0%(14.5)%(2.0)%(15.5)%Asia2.5%(4.5)%0.5%(1.5)%Africa/Eurasia6.0%(23.5)%—%(17.5)%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care4.5%(12.0)%(0.5)%(8.0)%Pet Nutrition6.0%(8.0)%—%(2.0)%Total Company5.0%(11.5)%(0.5)%(7.0)%Year ended December 31, 2014OrganicSales Growth(Non-GAAP)ForeignExchangeImpactAcquisitions and DivestmentsImpactNet Sales Growth(GAAP)Oral, Personal and Home Care North America2.5%(1.0)%—%1.5%Latin America9.0%(14.5)%0.5%(5.0)%Europe/South Pacific1.5%(0.5)%(0.5)%0.5%Asia4.5%(3.0)%—%1.5%Africa/Eurasia7.0%(11.0)%—%(4.0)%Total Oral, Personal and Home Care5.0%(6.0)%—%(1.0)%Pet Nutrition4.0%(2.0)%—%2.0%Total Company5.0%(6.0)%—%(1.0)% 39(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, costs related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operations was $2,949 in 2015, compared to $3,298 in 2014 and $3,204 in 2013. Net cash provided by operations for 2015 decreased due to: a decrease in Operating profit, excluding a charge related to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, charges related to the Venezuela Remeasurements, a gain on the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico and charges for foreign competition law matters in both periods, as applicable; higher income tax payments; and payments for a foreign competition law matter. The increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was 0.5% and 0.8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. This decrease is primarily due to the exclusion of the working capital of the Company’s Venezuelan operations as of December 31, 2015. On October 29, 2015, the Company’s Board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the Company’s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific (discussed below) to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program and extend it through December 31, 2017. The Company will update its disclosure to reflect the impact the expansion will have on the range of estimated charges and savings for the 2012 Restructuring Program when the additional initiatives under the expanded program are approved. The charges and savings discussed below do not reflect the impact of this expansion. Approximately 75% of total program charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 pretax ($950 to $1,050 aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. The anticipated pretax charges for 2016 are expected to amount to approximately $285 to $435 ($210 to $310 aftertax) and savings in 2016 are expected to amount to approximately $60 to $70 pretax ($55 to $65 aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 Restructuring Program will be funded from operating cash flows. Approximately 60% of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2015 is expected to be paid before year end 2016.Investing activities used $685 of cash in 2015, reflecting a reduction in cash of $75 as CP Venezuela’s cash is no longer included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet effective December 31, 2015, compared to $859 and $890 during 2014 and 2013, respectively. Purchases of marketable securities and investments increased in 2015 to $742 from $340 in 2014, partially due to an increase, prior to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, in CP Venezuela’s investments in local currency-denominated fixed interest rate government bonds and a fixed interest rate note receivable, an increase in purchases by the Company’s Argentinian subsidiary of U.S. dollar-linked fixed interest rate government bonds and an increase in bank deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days. Proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments increased in 2015 to $599 from $283 in 2014 partially due to higher proceeds, prior to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, from CP Venezuela’s investments in local currency-denominated fixed interest rate government bonds and a fixed interest rate note receivable, higher proceeds from the Company’s Argentinian subsidiary’s investment in U.S. dollar-linked fixed interest rate government bonds and an increase in proceeds from the redemption of bank deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days. 40(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)In August 2015, the Company completed the sale of its laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 310 Australian dollars ($221) and recorded a pretax gain of $187 ($120 aftertax or $0.13 per diluted share). The gain is net of charges related to the right-sizing of the Company’s South Pacific business, asset write-offs related to the divested laundry detergent business and other costs related to the sale. As discussed above, the funds from the sale will be reinvested to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program.In 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. During 2011 and 2012, the Company received the first and second installments of $24 and $36, respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico. The parties have subsequently amended the agreement to extend the closing date. Under the existing agreement, the final installment of the purchase price is due upon the transfer of the property, which is subject to the Company’s satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by February 29, 2016. If these conditions are not fully satisfied by such date, the agreement will automatically be extended to March 30, 2016. While these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by March 30, 2016, in which case the Purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installments of the purchase price), based on the discussions to date, the Company believes that an additional amendment will be negotiated and the transfer of the property is expected to occur by the third quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures were $691, $757 and $670 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be approximately 4.5% of Net sales, which is higher than the historical rate of approximately 3.5% primarily due to the 2012 Restructuring Program. Financing activities used $2,276 of cash during 2015 compared to $2,170 and $2,142 during 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt, higher dividends paid and higher purchases of treasury shares, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. The increase in cash used in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt and higher dividends paid, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $6,567 as of December 31, 2015, as compared to $6,132 as of December 31, 2014 and total debt increased to $6,571 as of December 31, 2015 as compared to $6,148 as of December 31, 2014. The Company’s debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company issued $600 of thirty-year notes at a fixed rate of 4.00%. During the second quarter of 2015 the Company issued €500 of euro-denominated four-year notes at a variable rate. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company issued $134 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. During the first quarter of 2014, the Company issued $500 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.75% and $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.25%. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company issued $300 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.50% and $82 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. During the second quarter of 2013, the Company issued $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.90% and $400 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.10%. The debt issuances during the third quarter of 2015, the first and fourth quarters of 2014 and the second and fourth quarters of 2013 were U.S. dollar-denominated. The debt issuances in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and third quarters of 2015, first quarter of 2014 and second and fourth quarters of 2013 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. Proceeds from the debt issuance in the first quarter of 2014 were also used to repay and retire $250 of U.S. dollar-denominated notes and €250 of euro-denominated notes, both of which became due in the second quarter of 2014. Proceeds from the debt issuance in the second quarter of 2013 were also used to repay and retire $250 of notes due in 2013. 41(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)At December 31, 2015, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,976 (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. This facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013. In 2014, the Company entered into an amendment of this facility whereby the facility was extended for an additional year to November 2019 and the capacity of the facility was increased to $2,370. The Company also has the ability to draw $165 from a revolving credit facility that expires in November 2016. In addition, the Company has the ability to draw $20 from a credit facility that expires in December 2016. Commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $5 and $255 as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2015 and 2014 were $1,989 and $1,486, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in November 2019.The following is a summary of the Company’s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturities OutstandingPayable to banks 1.8% 2016 $4 1.9% 2015 $16Commercial paper —% 2016 5 —% 2015 255Total $9 $271Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.Dividend payments in 2015 were $1,493, an increase from $1,446 in 2014 and $1,382 in 2013. Dividend payments increased to $1.50 per share in 2015 from $1.42 per share in 2014 and $1.33 per share in 2013. In the first quarter of 2015, the Company’s Board increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.38 per share from $0.36 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2015. The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. The share repurchase program approved by the Board on September 8, 2011 (the “2011 Program”) authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the Company’s common stock. On February 19, 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under a new share repurchase program (the “2015 Program”), which replaced the 2011 Program. The Company commenced repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2015 Program beginning February 19, 2015. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs.Aggregate share repurchases in 2015 consisted of 19.9 million common shares under the 2015 Program, 1.7 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,551. Aggregate repurchases in 2014 consisted of 21.7 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.5 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,530. Aggregate repurchases in 2013 consisted of 24.6 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,521. 42(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Cash and cash equivalents decreased $119 during 2015 to $970 at December 31, 2015, compared to $1,089 at December 31, 2014, most of which ($932 and $1,034, respectively) were held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The amount at December 31, 2014 included $64 that was subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that could be repatriated at any particular point in time. See Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings.As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $4,600 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the Company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings. These earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, therefore, are not subject to such taxes. Should these earnings be repatriated in the future, they would be subject to applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes. As the Company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015: Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 ThereafterLong-term debt including current portion $6,567 $298 $649 $698 $1,045 $248 $3,629Net cash interest payments on long-term debt(1) 1,376 129 110 108 102 100 827Leases 926 188 152 139 129 120 198Purchase obligations(2) 697 449 125 83 16 16 8Total $9,566 $1,064 $1,036 $1,028 $1,292 $484 $4,662_______(1) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.(2) The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2015 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2016. Management also does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2016. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2016 from the Company’s assets are estimated to be approximately $63.Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. 43(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk ExposureThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.Foreign Exchange RiskAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.Prior to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, which was effective December 31, 2015, the functional currency for CP Venezuela was the U.S. dollar since Venezuela was designated as hyper-inflationary, and Venezuelan currency fluctuations were reported in income. The local currency-denominated non-monetary assets of the Venezuelan operations, including inventories and property, plant and equipment were remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at period-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations were included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company. Refer to Executive Overview and Outlook above and to Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s Venezuelan operations. The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $35 and $22 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2015, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $39. 44(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.Based on year-end 2015 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $14 in 2015.Commodity Price RiskThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized losses of $0 and $1 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At the end of 2015, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. Recent Accounting PronouncementsOn January 5, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The amendment to the standard is effective for the Company beginning on June 1, 2018. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,” which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. Under the new accounting standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be classified as noncurrent, eliminating the prior requirement to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The standard may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently assessing the timing of adoption of the new guidance, but does not expect it will have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 “Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out (“LIFO”) and the retail inventory method. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 45(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” which requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Under the former accounting standards, such costs were recorded as an asset. On August 18, 2015, the FASB clarified that the guidance in ASU No. 2015-03 does not apply to line-of-credit arrangements. Accordingly, companies may continue to present debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. The new guidance in ASU No. 2015-03 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02 “Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis” that amends the current consolidation guidance. The amendments affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models. The new guidance was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 28, 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. The standard, issued as ASU No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” by the FASB, provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards. ASU No. 2014-09 was to be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. However, on July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to approve a one-year deferral of the effective date. This new guidance is now expected to be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The standard allows for either “full retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or “modified retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.▪Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in Cost of sales, Gross profit margin would have decreased by 770 bps, from 58.6% to 50.9% in 2015 and decreased by 770 bps and 750 bps in 2014 and 2013, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.▪The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method (80% of inventories) and the LIFO method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2015, 2014 or 2013 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. 46(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves and, prior to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela.▪In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 4.93%, 4.24% and 4.96% as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 4.97%, 4.36% and 5.24% as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 6.80% as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return.Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were (1)%, 7%, 6%, 6% and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53% in fixed income securities, 27% in equity securities and 20% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $10. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $3. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.▪The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 6.67% for 2016, declining to 4.75% by 2022 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $6.▪The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.25. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%. 47(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)▪Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company’s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. The asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. Qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.The estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition in 2011, which were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values. ▪The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.▪Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.▪Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.▪Prior to the change in accounting for the Company’s Venezuelan operations, the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela required careful consideration by management given the various currency exchange mechanisms that exist in Venezuela. Although access to U.S. dollars in Venezuela has been challenging, because the majority of the products in CP Venezuela’s portfolio have been designated as “essential” by the Venezuelan government, historically CP Venezuela’s access to U.S. dollars at the official rate of 6.30 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its U.S. dollar obligations for imported materials. However, the Company did not believe this rate was applicable to foreign investments and could not be used to pay dividends. The Company also gave consideration to using the SIMADI rate to remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela; however, CP Venezuela did not participate in the SIMADI market through December 31, 2015 and had no intention to do so. As a result, the Company remeasured the financial statements of CP Venezuela at the rate at which it believed was applicable for the remittance of future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, was the SICAD rate.Refer to Executive Overview and Outlook above and to Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s Venezuelan operations.The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies. 48(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Market Share Information Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data. Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. We believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to net sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings growth, financial goals, the impact of currency devaluations, exchange controls, price or profit controls and labor unrest, cost-reduction plans including the 2012 Restructuring Program, tax rates, new product introductions, commercial investment levels, acquisitions and divestitures, including the Mexico land sale, or legal proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain economic environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, the ability to implement the 2012 Restructuring Program as planned or differences between the actual and the estimated costs or savings under such program, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the ability to continue lowering costs, the ability to complete acquisitions and divestitures as planned and the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit. For information about these and other factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.” 49ITEM 7A.
