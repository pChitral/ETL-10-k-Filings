Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Emerson's financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management uses additional measures to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. These measures may exclude, for example, the impact of unique items (acquisitions, divestitures, one-time gains and losses) or items outside of management's control (foreign currency exchange rates).

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Information appearing under “Results of Operations,” “Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity,” “Critical Accounting Policies” and the ""Safe Harbor Statement"" in the 2007 Annual Report are hereby incorporated by reference. Fiscal 2008 Outlook The outlook for Emerson remains positive moving into fiscal 2008. Many of Emerson’s end markets remain strong, but a moderation in growth rates is expected when compared to 2007. Underlying sales growth for fiscal 2008 is expected to be in the range of 5 percent to 7 percent, which excludes the expected 2 percent to 3 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures. Reported sales growth is expected to be in the range of 7 percent to 10 percent. Based on this level of sales growth, the Company expects to generate 2008 earnings per share growth in the range of 10 percent to 15 percent above the $2.66 per share earned in fiscal 2007. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management uses additional measures, including non-GAAP financial measures as such term is defined in Regulation G under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For example, these financial measures may exclude the impact of certain unique items such as acquisitions, divestitures, one-time gains and losses or items outside of management’s control (e.g., foreign currency exchange rates). Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into Emerson’s financial position and performance. Underlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding these unique items that impact the overall comparability. Underlying sales should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to net sales as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. Operating profit and operating profit margin should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to pretax earnings or profit margin as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 16 Earnings, earnings per share, return on equity and return on total capital excluding one-time gains and losses (for example, 2005 tax expense for earnings repatriation or 2003 gains from divestitures) provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items. Given the unique nature of these items, management believes that presenting earnings, earnings per share, return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the Company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors. However, these financial measures are not intended to replace earnings, earnings per share, return on equity or return on total capital as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) is an indicator of the Company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. Operating cash flow adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Although management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the Company’s ability to generate cash, it is not intended to replace operating cash flow as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Overall, while Emerson believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies, and therefore they may not be comparable among companies.

Fiscal 2009 Outlook Fiscal year 2008 was a record year and Emerson is well positioned moving into an uncertain 2009 recessionary environment. Reported sales are forecast to be in the range of $23.5 billion to $25.5 billion, or negative 5 percent to positive 3 percent compared to 2008 sales of $24.8 billion. Underlying sales growth is expected to be in the range of negative 4 percent to positive 4 percent, which excludes an estimated 5 percent unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation at current exchange rates, and a favorable impact from completed and assumed future acquisitions of approximately 4 percent. Based on this level of sales, the Company forecasts 2009 earnings per share in the range of $2.80 to $3.20. There can be no assurance when and if future acquisitions will be completed, and what impact future exchange rates will have. 16 Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management uses additional measures, including non-GAAP financial measures as such term is defined in Regulation G under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future.

Fiscal 2010 Outlook Fiscal year 2009 was a challenging year, but Emerson believes it is well positioned moving into the uncertain 2010 economic environment. Underlying sales for fiscal year 2010 are expected to decline in the range of negative 5 percent to negative 7 percent, which excludes an estimated favorable increase of 7 percent to 5 percent due to foreign currency translation, completed and assumed future acquisitions and potential divestitures. Reported sales for the year are forecast to be in the range of positive 2 percent to negative 2 percent compared with 2009 sales of $20.9 billion. The Company also expects the operating profit margin to be flat to slightly down for the full year. There can be no assurance when or if potential future acquisitions or divestitures will be completed and what impact future exchange rate changes will have. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures” as such term is defined in Regulation G under the rules of the SEC, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future.

Fiscal 2011 Outlook Fiscal year 2010 was a challenging year but improving economic circumstances and strong operating results in the second half of the year have Emerson well positioned moving into 2011. Underlying sales for fiscal year 2011 are expected to increase in the range of positive 7 percent to 10 percent, which excludes an estimated favorable increase of 5 percent due to completed acquisitions and foreign currency translation. Net sales for the year are forecast to be in the range of positive 12 percent to 15 percent compared with 2010 sales of $21 billion. The Company also expects operating profit margin in the range of 17.2 percent to 17.5 percent (excludes 3.0 percent to 2.8 percent for other deductions, net and interest) and pretax margin of 14.2 percent to 14.7 percent.

Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability (GAAP measures: pretax earnings or pretax profit margin). Earnings, earnings per share, return on equity and return on total capital excluding one-time gains and losses provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items.

Fiscal 2012 Outlook The Company achieved strong sales and earnings results in 2011 and is well positioned moving into 2012, despite a weakening trend in business conditions. Underlying sales for fiscal year 2012 are expected to increase in the range of 5 percent to 7 percent, which excludes an estimated 1 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Net sales for the year are forecast to be in the range of positive 4 percent to 6 percent compared with 2011 sales of $24.2 billion. The Company also expects operating profit margin of approximately 18 percent (excluding approximately 2.5 percent for other deductions, net and interest) and pretax margin of approximately 15.5 percent. Earnings per share growth is expected in the range of 8 percent to 12 percent. Process Management sources electrical and electronic components for some products from areas in Thailand that have suffered significant flood damage.

Underlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales). Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability (U.S. GAAP measures: pretax earnings or pretax profit margin). 17 Earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items. Given the nature of these items, management believes that presenting earnings, earnings per share, return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the Company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors (U.S. GAAP measures: earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity, return on total capital).

Reported sales growth is expected to be in the range of 7 to 11 percent. Based on this level of sales growth, the Company expects to generate 2007 earnings per share growth in the range of 12 to 15 percent above the $4.48 per share earned in 2006. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management uses additional measures, including non-GAAP financial measures as such term is defined in Regulation G under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For example, these financial measures may exclude the impact of certain unique items such as acquisitions, divestitures, one-time gains and losses or items outside of management’s control (e.g., foreign currency exchange rates). Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into Emerson’s financial position and performance. Underlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding these unique items that impact the overall comparability. Underlying sales should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to net sales as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. 16 Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. Operating profit and operating profit margin should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to pretax earnings or profit margin as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Earnings, earnings per share, return on equity and return on total capital excluding one-time gains and losses (for example, 2005 tax expense for earnings repatriation or 2003 gains from divestitures) provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items. Given the unique nature of these items, management believes that presenting earnings, earnings per share, return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the Company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors. However, these financial measures are not intended to replace earnings, earnings per share, return on equity or return on total capital as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) is an indicator of the Company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. Operating cash flow adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Although management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the Company’s ability to generate cash, it is not intended to replace operating cash flow as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Overall, while Emerson believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies, and therefore they may not be comparable among companies.
